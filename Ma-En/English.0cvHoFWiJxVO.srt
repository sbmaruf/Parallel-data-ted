1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,844
We now have the general tools

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,380
to really tackle any multiplication problems.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,380
So in this video I'm just going to do a ton of examples.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,660
So let's start off with-- and I'll start in yellow.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:20,439
Let's start off with thirty-two times eighteen.

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,248
Say eight times two is sixteen.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,747
Well, I'll do it in our head this time

8
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:28,500
because you don't always have all this space to work with.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,680
So eight times two is sixteen.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
Put the one up there.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,490
Eight times three is twenty-four.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,535
Twenty-four plus one is twenty-five.

13
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:46,284
So eight times thirty-two was two hundred fifty-six.

14
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:48,128
Now we're going to have to multiply this one,

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,210
which is really a ten, times thirty-two.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,210
I'll underline it with the orange.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,420
One times two-- oh, we have to be very careful here.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,760
One times two is two.

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,070
So you might say hey, let me stick a two down there.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,630
Remember, this isn't a one.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,460
This is a ten, so we have to stick a zero there

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,610
to remember that.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,727
So ten times two is twenty.

24
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,202
Or you say one times two is two,

25
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:15,010
but you're putting it in the tens place, so you still get twenty.

26
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,654
So ten times two is twenty.

27
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:17,650
It works out.

28
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,500
Then one times three.

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,740
And we have to be very careful.

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,780
Let's get rid of what we had from before.

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,590
One times three is three.

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,380
There's nothing to add here, so you just get a three.

33
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,530
And so you get ten times thirty-two is three hundred twenty.

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,200
This one right here, that's a ten.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,820
Ten plus eight is eighteen.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,805
So now we just add up the two numbers.

37
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,500
You add them up.

38
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,400
Six plus zero is six.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,170
Five plus two is seven.

40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,230
Two plus three is five.

41
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,830
Let's keep going.

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,574
Let's do ninety-nine times eighty-eight.

43
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,440
That's going to give us a big number!

44
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,050
Eight times nine is seventy-two.

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,680
Stick the seven up there.

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,430
And then you have eight times nine again.

47
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,330
Eight times nine is seventy-two, but now you have the seven up here.

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,270
So seventy-two plus seven is seventy-nine.

49
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Fair enough.

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
Now we're done with this.

51
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,125
Let's just delete it

52
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:22,150
just so that we don't get confused in our next step.

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,230
In our next step, we're going to multiply this eight now times ninety-nine.

54
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,800
But this eight is an eighty.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,410
So let's stick a zero down there.

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,000
Eight times nine is seventy-two.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,650
Stick a seven up there.

58
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,580
Then eight times nine is seventy-two.

59
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,282
Plus seven is seventy-nine.

60
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:40,324
Two plus zero is two.

61
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,460
Let me switch colors.

62
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,550
Nine plus two is eleven.

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,810
Carry the one.

64
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,870
One plus seven is eight.

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,140
Eight plus nine is seventeen.

66
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,090
Carry the one.

67
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,520
One plus seven is eight.

68
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,380
Eight thousand seven hundred twelve.

69
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,950
Let's keep going.

70
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,110
Can't do enough of these.

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:09,368
All right, fifty-three times seventy-eight.

72
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,139
I think you're getting the hang of it now.

73
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,400
Let's multiply eight times fifty-three first.

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,320
So eight times three is twenty-four.

75
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,880
Stick the two up there.

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,970
Eight times five is forty.

77
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,846
Forty plus two is forty-two.

78
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:29,510
Now we're going to have to deal with that seven.

79
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,970
That seven right there, which is really a seventy.

80
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,300
So we got to remember to put the zero there.

81
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,190
Seven times three, and let's get rid of this.

82
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,440
Don't want to get confused.

83
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,040
Seven times three is twenty-one.

84
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,460
Put the one there and put the two up here.

85
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,830
Seven times five is thirty-five.

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,270
Plus two is thirty-seven.

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,040
Now we're ready to add.

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,950
Four plus zero is four.

89
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,930
Two plus one is three.

90
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,210
Four plus seven is eleven.

91
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,950
Carry the one.

92
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,140
One plus three is four.

93
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,970
Four thousand one hundred thirty-four.

94
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,131
Let's up the stakes a little bit.

95
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:27,228
So let's say I had seven hundred ninety-six times fifty-eight.

96
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,850
Let's mix it up well.

97
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,080
All right, so first we're just going to multiply eight times seven hundred ninety-six.

98
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,400
And notice, I've thrown in an extra digit up here.

99
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,870
So eight times six is forty-eight.

100
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,940
Put the four up there.

101
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,440
Eight times nine is seventy-two.

102
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,676
Plus four is seventy-six.

103
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:54,622
And then eight times seven is fifty-six.

104
00:04:54,622 --> 00:05:01,392
Fifty-six plus seven is sixty-three.

105
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:02,936
I'm sure I'll make a careless mistake

106
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,070
at some point in this video.

107
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,560
And the goal for you is to identify if and when I do.

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,625
All right, now we're ready,

109
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,485
so we can get rid of these guys up here.

110
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:14,430
Now we can multiply this five, which is in the tens place.

111
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,720
It's really a fifty.

112
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,770
Times this up here.

113
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,160
Because it's a fifty we stick a zero down there.

114
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,230
Five times six is thirty.

115
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,980
Put the zero there, put the three up there.

116
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,860
Five times nine is forty-five.

117
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,220
Plus the three is forty-eight.

118
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,920
Five times seven is thirty-five.

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,769
Plus four is thirty-nine.

120
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:43,408
Now we're ready to add.

121
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,620
Eight plus zero is eight.

122
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,510
Six plus zero is six.

123
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,640
Three plus eight is eleven.

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,060
One plus six is seven.

125
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,110
Seven plus nine is sixteen.

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,480
And then one plus three is four.

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,180
So seven hundred ninety-six times fifty-eight is forty-six thousand one hundred sixty-eight.

128
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,928
And that sounds about right,

129
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:10,400
because seven hundred ninety-six-- it's almost eight hundred.

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,180
You know, which is almost one thousand.

131
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,311
So if we multiplied one thousand times fifty-eight we'd get fifty-eight thousand.

132
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,545
But we're multiplying something a little bit smaller

133
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,648
than one thousand times fifty-eight,

134
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,160
so we're getting something a little bit smaller than fifty-eight thousand.

135
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,805
So the number is in the correct ballpark.

136
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,902
Now let's do one more here

137
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:33,310
where I'm really going to step up the stakes.

138
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,387
Let's do five hundred twenty-three times--

139
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:41,725
I'm going to do a three-digit number now.

140
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:45,170
Times seven hundred ninety-eight.

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,930
That's a big three-digit number!

142
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,570
But it's the same exact process.

143
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,395
And once you kind of see the pattern

144
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:55,910
you'll say, hey, this'll apply to any number of digits times any number of digits.

145
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,748
It'll just start taking you a long time

146
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:00,564
and your chances of making a careless mistake are going to go up,

147
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,560
but it's the same idea.

148
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,060
So we start with eight times five hundred twenty-three.

149
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,730
Eight times three is twenty-four.

150
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,050
Stick the two up there.

151
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,330
Now eight times two is sixteen.

152
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,830
Sixteen plus two is eighteen.

153
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,570
Put the one up there.

154
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,380
Eight times five is forty.

155
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,540
Plus one is forty-one.

156
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,230
So eight times five hundred twenty-three is four thousand one hundred eighty-four.

157
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,050
We're not done.

158
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,250
We have to multiply times the ninety and by the seven hundred.

159
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,180
So let's do the ninety right there.

160
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,230
So it's a ninety, so we'll stick a zero there.

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,850
It's not a nine.

162
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,095
And let's get rid of these guys right there.

163
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:49,851
Nine times three is twenty-seven.

164
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:54,033
Nine times two is eighteen.

165
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:59,093
Eighteen plus two is twenty.

166
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:03,916
And then we have nine times five is forty-five.

167
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:09,620
Forty-five plus two is forty-seven.

168
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,450
I don't want to write it that thick.

169
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,416
Forty-seven.

170
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,869
Let me make sure I did that one right,

171
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,450
and let's just review it a little bit.

172
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,530
Nine times three was twenty-seven.

173
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,170
We wrote the seven down here and put the two up there.

174
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,490
Nine times two is eighteen.

175
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,110
We added two to that, so we wrote twenty.

176
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,310
Wrote the zero down there and the two up there.

177
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,610
The nine times five was forty-five.

178
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Plus two is forty-seven.

179
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,605
You really have to make sure

180
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:37,350
that you don't make careless mistakes with these.

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,970
Then finally, we have to multiply the seven,

182
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,760
which is really a seven hundred times five hundred twenty-three.

183
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,982
When it was just an eight we just started multiplying here.

184
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:48,190
When it was a ninety, when we were dealing with the tens place,

185
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,710
we put a zero there.

186
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,628
Now that we're dealing with something that's in the hundreds

187
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:56,851
we're going to put two zeros there.

188
00:08:56,851 --> 00:09:00,597
And so you have seven-- and let's get rid of this stuff.

189
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,993
Seven times three is twenty-one.

190
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,420
Put the one there.

191
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,460
Stick the two up there.

192
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,070
Seven times two is fourteen.

193
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,120
Fourteen plus our two is sixteen.

194
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,620
Put the one up there.

195
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,390
Seven times five is thirty-five.

196
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,542
Plus one is thirty-six.

197
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,811
And now we're ready to add.

198
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,440
And hopefully we didn't make any careless mistakes.

199
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,940
So four plus zero plus zero.

200
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,540
That's easy.

201
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,470
That's four.

202
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,100
Eight plus seven plus zero.

203
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,020
That's fifteen.

204
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,750
Carry the one.

205
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,510
One plus one plus one is three.

206
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,540
Four plus seven plus six.

207
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,070
That's what's?

208
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,020
Four plus six is ten.

209
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,571
It's seventeen.

210
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,902
And then we have one plus four is five.

211
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,200
Five plus six is eleven.

212
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,220
Carry the one.

213
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,350
One plus three is four.

214
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,262
So five hundred twenty-three times seven hundred ninety-eight

215
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:03,568
is four hundred seventeen thousand three hundred fifty-four.

216
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,720
Now we can even check to make sure.

217
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,230
And so this is the moment of truth.

218
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,610
Let's see if we have-- let's see,

219
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,550
five hundred twenty-three times seven hundred ninety-eight.

220
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,420
There you go.

221
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,140
Moment of truth.

222
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,210
I don't have to re-record this video.

223
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,000
It's four hundred seventeen thousand three hundred fifty-four.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,962
But we did it without the calculator,

225
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,370
which is the important point.

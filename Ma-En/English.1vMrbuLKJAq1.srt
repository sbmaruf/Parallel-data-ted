1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia --

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[were] fighting.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So there was no job, no food.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Children, most of them,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
became very malnourished, like this.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
always in a civil war,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the ones affected most [are] the women and children.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So our patients are women and children.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And they are in our backyard.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's our home. We welcome them.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's the camp that we have in now

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
90,000 people,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
where 75 percent of them are women and children.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because people need some help.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There is no government to protect them.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
maybe more or less.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But sometimes we are only five doctors

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and 16 nurses,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But we take the severe ones,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we reschedule the other ones the next day.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is very tough.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it's the women who come into the hospitals;

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
it's the women [are] building the houses.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's their house.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And we have a school. This is our bright --

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
where we have 850 children,

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and the majority are women and girls.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
(Applause)

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
PM: And the doctors have some very big rules

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
about who can get treated at the clinic.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Would you explain the rules for admission?

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
HA: The people who are coming to us,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we are welcoming.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We are sharing with them

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
whatever we have.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But there are only two rules.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
First rule:

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
there is no clan distinguished and political division

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in Somali society.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The second:

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
no man can beat his wife.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If he beat,

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
we will put [him] in jail,

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and we will call the eldest people.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Until they identify this case,

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we'll never release him.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's our two rules.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
(Applause)

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The other thing that I have realized,

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that the woman is the most strong person

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
all over the world.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because the last 20 years,

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the Somali woman has stood up.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They were the leaders,

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and we are the leaders

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
of our community

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and the hope of our future generations.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We are not just the helpless

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the victims of the civil war.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We can reconcile.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We can do everything.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
(Applause)

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and the men are only killing in Somalia.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So we came up with these two rules.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In a camp with 90,000 people,

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So there is no clan division,

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and no man can beat his wife.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And we have a little storage room

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
where we converted a jail.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
(Applause)

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity --

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we are there for them. They are not alone for this.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
PM: You're running a medical clinic.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It brought much, much needed medical care

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to people who wouldn't get it.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're also running a civil society.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You've created your own rules,

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
in which women and children

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
are getting a different sense of security.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and your decision, Dr. Mohamed,

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to work together --

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
for you to become a doctor

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and to work with your mother in these circumstances.

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
HA: My age --

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because I was born in 1947 --

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we were having, at that time,

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
government, law and order.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But one day, I went to the hospital --

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
my mother was sick --

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
how they [are] committed

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to help the sick people.

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I admired them,

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and I decided to become a doctor.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My mother died, unfortunately,

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
when I was 12 years [old].

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Then my father allowed me

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to proceed [with] my hope.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My mother died

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
in [a] gynecology complication,

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
so I decided to become

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
a gynecology specialist.

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's why I became a doctor.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So Dr. Deqo has to explain.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe I should become an historian,

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
or maybe a reporter.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I loved it, but it didn't work.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When the war broke out -- civil war --

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I saw how my mother was helping

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and how she really needed the help,

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and how the care is essential to the woman

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to be a woman doctor in Somalia

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and help the women and children.

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
(Laughter)

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So I went to Russia, and my mother also,

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So some of our character,

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's how I decided [to do] the same.

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My sister was different.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She's here. She's also a doctor.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She graduated in Russia also.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
(Applause)

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And to go back and to work with our mother

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
is just what we saw in the civil war --

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
when I was 16, and my sister was 11,

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
when the civil war broke out.

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So it was the need and the people we saw

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in the early '90s --

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that's what made us go back

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and work for them.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
PM: So what is the biggest challenge

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
working, mother and daughter,

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in such dangerous

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and sometimes scary situations?

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
very dangerous.

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And when I saw the people who needed me,

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was staying with them to help,

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
because I [could] do something for them.

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Most people fled abroad.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But I remained with those people,

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and I was trying to do something --

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
[any] little thing I [could] do.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I succeeded in my place.

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now my place is 90,000 people

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
who are respecting each other,

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
who are not fighting.

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But we try to stand on our feet,

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
to do something, little things, we can for our people.

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I'm thankful for my daughters.

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When they come to me,

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
they help me to treat the people,

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
to help.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They do everything for them.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They have done what I desire to do for them.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
PM: What's the best part

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
of working with your mother,

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and the most challenging part for you?

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She always expects us to do more.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And really when you think [you] cannot do it,

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
she will push you, and I can do it.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's the best part.

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
She shows us, trains us how to do

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and how to be better [people]

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and how to do long hours in surgery --

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
300 patients per day,

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
10, 20 surgeries,

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and still you have to manage the camp --

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
that's how she trains us.

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It is not like beautiful offices here,

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
20 patients, you're tired.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and 90,000 people to manage.

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
PM: But you do it for good reasons.

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
(Applause)

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait. Wait.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
HA: Thank you.

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
DM: Thank you.

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
(Applause)

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.

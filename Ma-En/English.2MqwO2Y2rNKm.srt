1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540


2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,810
Complete the square on the
general quadratic equation.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,950
We have ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,160
So whenever I complete the
square, actually whenever I

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,620
deal with any of these types
of quadratic equations, I

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,710
always like to not have an a, or
a non 1 coefficient, on the

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,630
x squared terms. So let's make
it into a 1 coefficient.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,140
And the easiest way to do
that is just divide

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,330
everything by a.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,930
So we divide every term on the
left side by a, and of course

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,110
we have to divide the right
side by a as well.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,300
And so the left side
will become x

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,890
squared plus b over ax.

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,500


15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,630
And then I'll write c
over a over here.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,970
So we have some room to add and
subtract things so we can

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,620
really complete the square.

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,770
So plus c over a is equal to 0
divided by a, which is just

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,960
going to be equal to 0.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,800
Now when we complete the
square, we've seen this

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,710
multiple times before, what
we want to do is take the

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,819
coefficient on the x term right
here, it's b over a,

23
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,750
take half of it.

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,980
This right here is two
times b over 2a.

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,420
Right?

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,420
The 2's cancel out.

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,910
This is just 2 times
b over 2a.

28
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,020
So you take half of it, half
of b over a is b over 2a.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,270
You take half of it, and then
you square it, and you add it

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,830
right here.

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,565
So plus b squared-- Let
me write it this way.

32
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:31,780
b over 2a squared.

33
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,800
And of course I can't just add
something to one side of the

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,510
equation, that would change
the equation.

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,720
I also either have to add it
to the other side, or just

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,140
subtract it from the same side
that I'm adding it to.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,120
So I'll also subtract
the b over 2a

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,410
squared just like that.

39
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,770
Now, the whole point of doing
this is so these first three

40
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,200
terms right here are a perfect
square trinomial.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,290
That's what completing the
square is all about.

42
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,150
And we've seen the pattern
multiple times.

43
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:08,590
If I have, let's say, m plus n
squared-- and I'm using m and

44
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,650
n so we don't get confused
with the a's and b's

45
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,860
and x's over here.

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,430
But if I have m plus n squared,
we've seen multiple

47
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,250
times, that's going to be equal
to m squared plus 2mn

48
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,030
plus n squared.

49
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,760
And here we have that
pattern now.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,770
That's the whole point behind
completing the square.

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,390
That's the whole point behind
taking half of b over a--

52
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,780
that's b over 2a-- and then
squaring it and adding it

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,140
right here.

54
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,480
We now fit that pattern.

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,540
m is x.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,390
n is b over 2a.

57
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,140
And 2mn, if I take an x times a
b over 2a, and multiply that

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,420
by 2, I get b over ax.

59
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,780
So this expression, right here,
this trinomial, the

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,250
first three terms, it is a
perfect square trinomial, and

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:58,410
we can write it as x plus
b over 2a squared.

62
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,840
And then of course we
have all this other

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,450
business right here.

64
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,540
And then of course we
have all of this

65
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,960
other stuff right here.

66
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,360
Which is negative b over,
and let me just actually

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
square it for you.

68
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,410
So b over 2a squared
is negative b

69
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,970
squared over 4a squared.

70
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,660
And then I have this
plus c over a.

71
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,980
But let's write it with the
same denominator here.

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,530
So I could have c over a, or I
could multiply the numerator

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,280
and the denominator by 4a.

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,000
So if I multiply the numerator
by 4a, I get 4ac.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,040
If I multiply the denominator
by 4a, I get 4a squared.

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,290
And the whole reason why I
multiplied the numerator and

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,060
the denominator by 4a was
so that we have the same

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,400
denominator right here.

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,940
And, of course, that is going
to be equal to 0.

80
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,540
And we could simplify it a
little bit more, or actually,

81
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,550
well yeah we'll just simplify
it next in the next step.

82
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,580
We don't want to skip
too many steps here.

83
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,220
So you have x plus b
over 2a squared.

84
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,380
And then we could say, plus-- we
could put the 4ac first, so

85
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,510
we could say-- actually let's
just say, plus negative b

86
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:23,230
squared, plus 4ac, all of that
over 4a squared is equal to 0.

87
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,650
I didn't put the 4ac first,
I just put the negative b

88
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,280
squared there.

89
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Now let's isolate this
squared binomial on

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,600
the left hand side.

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
And the easiest way we can do
that is to subtract this thing

92
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,150
from both sides of
the equation.

93
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,040
So let's do that.

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,540
So you can imagine if we add
b-- let me do this in a

95
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,060
different color.

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,540
If we were to add positive b
squared minus 4ac over 4a

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,950
squared on the left hand side,
those will cancel out and

98
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,570
we're also going to add it
on the right hand side.

99
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,780
Positive b squared minus
4ac over 4a squared.

100
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,650
Anything I do the left I
have to do the right.

101
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,900
What do we end up with?

102
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,540


103
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,970
We end up with, on the left
hand side, these two guys

104
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,470
cancel out.

105
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,460
We have the same denomenator,
when you add the numerators,

106
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,800
that cancels with that.

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,270
The 4ac cancels with the
negative 4ac, these just

108
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,640
completely cancel out.

109
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,060
And on the left hand side,
you just have x

110
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,640
plus b over 2a squared.

111
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,090
And on the right hand side, you
have that being equal to b

112
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,660
squared minus-- let me do
that in a blue color.

113
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:43,190
b squared minus 4ac, all of
that over 4a squared.

114
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,330
Now the next thing we probably
want to do, if we want to

115
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,310
really solve for x, is to take
the square root of both sides

116
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,510
of this equation.

117
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,300
So let's do that.

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,050
Let's take the square root of
both sides of this equation.

119
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,220
And if, when we do that-- We
don't want to only take the

120
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,120
positive square root because x
plus b be over 2a could be a

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,220
negative number, or it could
be a positive number.

122
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,070
So we want to take
the positive and

123
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,740
negative square root.

124
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,030
So we could say that the square
root, we could put the

125
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,420
positive or negative here or,
since we're taking the square

126
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,480
root of both sides,
we could put the

127
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
positive or negative there.

128
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,800
If you put the positive or
negative on both sides, it's

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,390
really just telling you
the same thing.

130
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,290
It really is all the different
combinations.

131
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,720
If the negative square root over
here equals the negative

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,750
square root over here, then it's
just another combination

133
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,280
of the different positives
and negatives.

134
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,120
So you could just write it as,
this square root is equal to

135
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,410
the plus or minus square
root of b squared

136
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,710
minus 4ac over 4a squared.

137
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,710
Now what does this
simplify to?

138
00:06:49,710 --> 00:07:01,140
Well, the left hand side just
becomes x plus b over 2a is

139
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,100
equal to-- and now it
gets interesting.

140
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,960
And you might even start
recognizing parts of it.

141
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,150
So let's take the plus or minus
square root of the top.

142
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,480
What is that going to be?

143
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,550
And you could just take the plus
or minus only of the top

144
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,560
because, once again, the
same principles apply.

145
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,370
There's no reason why you have
to do a plus or minus over a

146
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,070
plus and minus and a plus or
minus on the left hand side.

147
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,940
There's only one combination
here, where there's only one

148
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,910
plus or minus on
the numerator.

149
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,630
I apologize if that
confuses you.

150
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,030
So let's write this as the plus
or minus square root of b

151
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,770
squared minus 4ac over--
What's the square

152
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,050
root of 4a a squared?

153
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,300
Well, it's just going
to be 2a.

154
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,865


155
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:44,420
Right?

156
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,930
The square root of 4 is 2.

157
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,800
The square root of
a squared is a.

158
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,100
And we're almost there.

159
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,620
To solve for x, we just have
to subtract b over 2a from

160
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,070
both sides.

161
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,640
We just have to subtract b over
2a from both sides of

162
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,800
this equation.

163
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
The left hand side, we just
end up with our x.

164
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,500
And then the right hand side,
we have a negative b over 2a

165
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:13,200
plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac-- all

166
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,630
of that over 2a.

167
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,890
Since we have the same
denominator, we can write this

168
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,710
as negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,730
minus 4ac-- all of
that over 2a.

170
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,260
And we're done.

171
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,300
We've solved for the x's and you
see there's actually two

172
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,289
solutions here.

173
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,340
There's one where you take the
positive square root, and

174
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,620
there's another solution
where you take the

175
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,380
negative square root.

176
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,429
If this square root exists,
and if the positive and

177
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,090
negative-- and if it's
not 0, you're

178
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,789
going to have two solutions.

179
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,360
And this, right here, this
result we have is-- Look, you

180
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,540
give me any quadratic equation,
you give me the a,

181
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,090
the b, and the c, we could now
substitute it into this

182
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,340
formula essentially we just
derived right here, and I'll

183
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,790
give you the roots, I'll give
you the x's for that quadratic

184
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,290
equation-- the x's that satisfy

185
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,490
that quadratic equation.

186
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,960
And this formula, right here,
for solving any quadratic

187
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,040
equation is called the
quadratic formula.

188
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,830


189
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,820
And you could see it just
comes straight out of

190
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,010
completing the square.

191
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,570
There's no mystery,
magic here.

192
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,700
But it's easily one of the
most useful formulas in

193
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,165
mathematics.

194
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:23,930
And I'm usually not
a huge proponent

195
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,070
of memorizing things.

196
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,570
But it probably will benefit
you in life if you did.

197
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,390
Hope you enjoyed that.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,705
I think we've all heard of the word, bacteria.

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:08,350
Bacteria.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,460
And we normally associate
it with negative things.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,640
You say bacteria, those are
germs. So we normally

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,800
associate those with germs, and
they indeed are germs, and

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,600
they cause a whole set
of negative things.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,540
Or at least from the standard
point of view, people believe

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,470
that they cause a whole bunch
of negative things.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,120
So let's just list them all
just to make sure we know

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,660
about them, we're all
on the same page.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,020
So the bad things they do, they
cause a lot of diseases:

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,670
tuberculosis, Lyme disease.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,990
I mean, I could go on and on.

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,060
You know, pretty much
any time-- well,

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,800
I'll be careful here.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,080
Whenever people talk about an
infection, it's often caused

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,740
by a bacteria.

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,360
It can also be caused
by a virus.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,560
An infection is, in general,
anything entering you and

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,170
taking advantage of your body
to kind of replicate itself,

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,040
and in the process,
making you sick.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,840
But bacterial infections,
let me write that down.

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,720
And this whole perception of
bacteria being a bad thing is

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,260
probably a good reason why
almost any soap you see now

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,495
will say antibacterial on it.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,750
Because the makers of the soap
know that in conventional

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,100
thinking, bacteria are viewed
as a negative thing.

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,450
And you're like, OK,
Sal, I know where

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,490
you're going with this.

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,470
Bacteria isn't all bad.

31
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,010
There are some good traits
of bacteria.

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,530
For example, I could stick some
yogurt in some-- or I

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,510
could stick some bacteria in
some milk and it'll help

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,540
produce some yogurt, sometimes
spelled yoghurt.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,200
And that's obviously
a good thing.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,930
It's a delicious thing to eat.

37
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,125
You say, well, I know I have
bacteria in my gut.

38
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,740
It helps me digest food.

39
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,570
And these are all true, but
you're like, look, you know,

40
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,670
on balance, I still think
bacteria is a bad thing.

41
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,620
I'm not going to take sides on
that debate, as I tend to

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,530
avoid taking sides on debates
in these science videos.

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,360
Maybe I'll do a whole playlist
where I do nothing but take

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,210
sides on debates, but here I
won't take any sides on that.

45
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,190
But I'll just point out that you
are to a large degree made

46
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,260
up of bacteria.

47
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,690
It's not just your gut.

48
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,330
It's not just the gut or the
yogurt you might eat or the

49
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,790
plaque on your teeth, which
is caused by bacteria.

50
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,850
It's this kind of film that's
created by bacteria that

51
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,920
eventually causes cavities
and whatever else.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,060
And it's not just the pimples
on your face.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,740
Bacteria actually represents
a majority of the

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,960
cells on your body.

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,930
So for every-- and this is kind
of an astounding fact.

56
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,220
For every one cell on the human
body, every one human

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,230
cell-- so these are all cells
that all have your DNA in them

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,560
and they'll have nucleuses, and
I'll talk about that in a

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,400
second-- you have 20 bacteria.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,100
Now, your response there is to
say, OK, that's fair enough,

61
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,620
but these bacteria must be much
smaller than the human

62
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,400
cell, so it must be a very small
fraction of my mass.

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,070
And you're right.

64
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,890
It's not like we're mostly
bacteria by mass, although we

65
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,640
are mostly bacteria
by actual cells.

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,950
But even if you were to take out
all of the water in your

67
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,850
body, then by mass, bacteria
is going to be

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,610
roughly 10% of your mass.

69
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,900
So I weigh about 150 pounds,
I've got 15 pounds of bacteria

70
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,470
walking around with me.

71
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,680
So we always kind of think of
ourselves as like the bacteria

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,930
is riding on us, but
to a large degree,

73
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,980
we're kind of in symbiosis.

74
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,960
We're kind of two creatures, or
not just two creatures, two

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,530
types of creatures living
together, because I don't have

76
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,160
just one type of
bacteria on me.

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,800
I have thousands of types
of bacteria on me.

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,060
There's a huge amount of
diversity, and we're just

79
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,150
scratching the surface in terms
of the number and types

80
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,400
and diversity of bacteria
that exist.

81
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,980
So I've talked a lot about
bacteria, and hopefully, this

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,030
fact right here will make you
realize that they're super

83
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,420
important to just our
everyday existence.

84
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,740
Just to make sure we understand
the magnitude of

85
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,280
this, in a previous video, and
I looked this up again, we

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,130
have on the order of 10
to a 100 trillion

87
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,380
cells, human cells.

88
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,670
So for every one of these we
have 20 bacteria, we're

89
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:59,700
talking about having on the
order of 200 to 2,000 trillion

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,450
bacteria on us at any time.

91
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,850
And I'm a hygienic person.

92
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,060
I take showers daily,
and that's even me.

93
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,930
It's not like you can somehow
eliminate them.

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,500
And even more, it's not
like you even want

95
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,420
to eliminate them.

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,390
But that's fair enough.

97
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,310
You're probably asking, OK,
Sal, I'm convinced that

98
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,270
bacteria are important.

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,830
What do they actually
look like?

100
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,700
And they're these small
unicellular organisms. That's

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,590
my bacteria right there.

102
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,090
And they're different from the
cells that make up us.

103
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,910
When I say us, I'll throw in
all plants, animals and

104
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,780
funguses, fungi.

105
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,080
And the big difference, or the
one that people noticed first,

106
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,020
is that all of the Eukarya,
which includes plants, animals

107
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,660
and fungi, all of their DNA
is inside of a nucleus, a

108
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,670
cellular nucleus.

109
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,600
So that's the nucleus
right there.

110
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
And all of our DNA,
it's normally in

111
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,140
its chromatin form.

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,820
It's all just spread around
something like that.

113
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,780
In bacteria, which are what
people originally just

114
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,040
classify it on whether or not
you have a nucleus, in

115
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,540
bacteria, there is no membrane
surrounding the DNA.

116
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,950
So what they have is just
a big bundle of DNA.

117
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,920
They just have this
big bundle of DNA.

118
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,760
It's sometimes in a
loop all in one

119
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,240
circle called a nucleoid.

120
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,970
Now, whenever we look at
something, and we say, oh, we

121
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,620
have this thing; it doesn't;
there's this assumption that

122
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,140
somehow we're superior or we're
more advanced beings.

123
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,850
But the reality is that bacteria
have infiltrated far

124
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,770
more ecosystems in every part
of the planet than Eukarya

125
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,710
have, and there's far more
diversity in bacteria than

126
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,770
there is in Eukarya.

127
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,510
So when you really think about
it, these are the more

128
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:16,260
successful organisms. If a comet
were to hit the Earth--

129
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,680
God forbid-- the organisms more
likely to survive are

130
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,110
going to be the bacteria than
the Eukarya, than the ones

131
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,020
with the larger-- not always
larger, but the organisms that

132
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,710
do have this nucleus and have
membrane-bound organelles like

133
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,900
mitochondria and all that.

134
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,700
We'll talk more about
it in the future.

135
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,860
Bacteria, for the
most part, are

136
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,280
just big bags of cytoplasm.

137
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,160
They have their DNA there.

138
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,050
They do have ribosomes because
they have to code for proteins

139
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,240
just like the rest of us do.

140
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,040
Some of those proteins, they'll
make some from--

141
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,500
bacteria, they'll make these
flagella, which are tails that

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,750
allow them to move around.

143
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,250
They also have these
things called pili.

144
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,650
Pili is plural for pilus or
pee-lus, so these pili.

145
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,950
And we'll see in a second that
the pili are kind of how the

146
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,970
bacteria are able to do one form
of introducing genetic

147
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,920
variation into their
populations.

148
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,550
Actually, I'll take a little
side note here.

149
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,870
I'm pointing out bacteria as
not having a cell wall.

150
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,550
There's actually another class
that used to be categorized as

151
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,080
type of a bacteria, and they're
called Archaea.

152
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,190
I should give them a little
bit of justice.

153
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,440
They're always kind
of the stepchild.

154
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,340
They used to be called Archaea
bacteria, but now people

155
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,190
realize, they've actually looked
at the DNA, because

156
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,380
when they originally looked at
these, they said, OK, these

157
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,789
guys also have no nucleus and a
bunch of DNA running around.

158
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,380
These must be a form
of bacteria.

159
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,000
But now that we've actually been
able to look into the DNA

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,160
of the things, we've
seen that they're

161
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,760
actually quite different.

162
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,160
But all of these, both bacteria
and Archaea, are

163
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,410
considered prokaryotes.

164
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,970
And this just means
no nucleus.

165
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,350
No nucleus, and more generally,
this is what most

166
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,740
people refer to, but more
generally, they don't have

167
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,300
these membrane-bound organelles
that our cells

168
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,410
have.

169
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,330
Now, the next question you might
say is, well, how do

170
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,300
these bacteria reproduce?

171
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,720
And for the most part, they do
something not completely

172
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,300
different from mitosis,
although I

173
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,420
want to call it mitosis.

174
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,900
We call it binary fission.

175
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm not going to go into the
deep mechanism here, but the

176
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,430
idea is fairly simple.

177
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,710
I have a bacteria right here.

178
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,500
It replicates its DNA, so
it'll have two of these

179
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,670
nucleoids here, and then the
cytoplasm essentially splits,

180
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,920
or it's kind of a form of
cleavage right there.

181
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,320
It splits and then you
have two of them.

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,440
You have two of them then.

183
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,970
And then each of them, they
can code for the proteins

184
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,270
necessary to produce all of
their extra appendages, the

185
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,580
flagellum, which is this
long tail-like thing

186
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,030
that can help it move.

187
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,340
And it's actually fascinating
because it's operating at such

188
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,900
a small scale, but you can still
kind of get this motor

189
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,950
movement going on.

190
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,070
Even at this very, very small
scale, using very primitive--

191
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,120
I won't say primitive, because
that's making a value judgment

192
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,066
on these things, but using-- you
know, these flagellum are

193
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,650
on the order of several
nanometers, on the order of

194
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,020
tens of nanometers wide.

195
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,020
So you don't have a lot of atoms
to deal with, but you're

196
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,000
still able to get this kind of
wave-like motion that can move

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,180
the bacteria around.

198
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,660
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal,
in that first video on

199
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,120
evolution, you told me that we
see evolution every day and

200
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,000
bacteria is one example.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,100
When we use antibiotics, we
think it'll help eliminate

202
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,800
bacteria, but that one bacteria
that has some type of

203
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,660
resistance, it'll survive,
so it is more fit.

204
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,120
How did these guys
get variation?

205
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,010
Well, the one way, and this is
the way everything can get

206
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,730
variation, is they can
get mutations.

207
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,600
And bacteria replicate so
quickly, they reproduce so

208
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,810
quickly that even if you have a
mutation that's one in every

209
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,705
thousand times, by the time you
have a million bacteria,

210
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:09,360
you'll have a thousand
mutations.

211
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,640
So they have mutations, but
they also have this form.

212
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,050
I don't want to call it sexual
reproduction, because it's not

213
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,850
sexual reproduction.

214
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,170
They don't form gametes and the
gametes don't fertilize

215
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,090
each other and then
produces a zygote.

216
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:29,840
But two bacteria can get near
each other and then one of

217
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,720
their piluses-- I'll
do that right here.

218
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,830
So the piluses are these little
structures on the side

219
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,690
of the bacteria.

220
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,250
They're these little
tubes, really.

221
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,340
One of the piluses can connect
from one bacteria to another,

222
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,710
and then essentially you have a
mixing of what's inside one

223
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,790
bacteria with another.

224
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,530
So let me draw their
nucleoids.

225
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,570
And then they have these other
pieces of just DNA that hangs

226
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,310
out called plasmids.

227
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,710
These are just circular
pieces of DNA.

228
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,460
Maybe this guy has got this
extra neat plasmid.

229
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,540
He got it from someplace, and
it's making him able to do

230
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,790
things that this guy
couldn't do.

231
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,040
Maybe this is the R plasmid,
which is known for making a

232
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,530
bacteria resistant to a
lot of antibiotics.

233
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,270
And what happens is, that
bacteria-- and actually,

234
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,530
there's mechanisms where the
bacteria know that, hey, this

235
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,850
guy doesn't have
the R plasmid.

236
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,940
And we're just beginning to
understand how it actually

237
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,900
works, but this will actually
replicate itself and give this

238
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,290
guy a version of
the R plasmid.

239
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,550
You could also have these
things, transposons, and I

240
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,240
should make a whole video
on this because we have

241
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,100
transposons, too.

242
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,160
But there's parts of DNA that
can jump from one part of a

243
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,870
fragment of DNA to another, and
these can also end up in

244
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,750
the other one.

245
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,230
So what you have is kind of--
it's not formal sexual

246
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,890
reproduction, but what you
essentially have is a

247
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,190
connection, and these bacteria
are just constantly swapping

248
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,730
DNA with each other and DNA is
jumping back and forth, so you

249
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,490
can imagine all sorts of
combinations of DNA happen

250
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,840
even within what you used to
call one bacterial species and

251
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,130
very quickly can turn to
multiple species and become

252
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,300
resistant to different things.

253
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,820
If this makes it resistant to
an antibiotic, then it can

254
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,150
kind of spread the information
to produce those resistant

255
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,850
proteins or whatever to
the other bacteria.

256
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,460
So this is kind of a form of
introducing variation.

257
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,940
And so when you transfer stuff
via this pilus, or the plural

258
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,660
is pili, this is called
conjugation, bacterial

259
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,910
conjugation.

260
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,640
Now, the last thing I want to
talk about, because it's

261
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,990
something that you've heard a
lot about, are antibiotics.

262
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,930
A lot of people,
they get sick.

263
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,550
The first thing they want
to get is an antibiotic.

264
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,830
And an antibiotic is just a
whole class of chemicals and

265
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,990
compounds, some of them
naturally derived, some of

266
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,810
them not, that kill bacteria.

267
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,660
So now if someone is undergoing
a surgery and they

268
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,670
get a cut, instead of them
having to worry about getting

269
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,240
an infection, they'll take some
antibiotics to prevent

270
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,980
the bacteria from
growing on them.

271
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,110
But the question is how was this
discovered or where does

272
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,050
it come from?

273
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,150
It actually came from
Alexander Fleming.

274
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,000
Let me write him down.

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,310
Very important, because the
discovery of antibiotics is,

276
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,380
in my opinion, the most
important discovery in

277
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,340
medicine so far.

278
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,290
So, Alexander Fleming.

279
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,130
He was studying-- I think
it was Staphylococcus.

280
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,920
I forget which bacteria
it was, but it

281
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,220
was in a Petri dish.

282
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,765
He was using a Petri dish.

283
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:38,985
Let me draw a Petri dish.

284
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,460
There's a little circle.

285
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,790
There's some nutrients that
the bacteria can grow on.

286
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,180
So let's say the bacteria, you
know, it's growing on this

287
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,170
Petri dish.

288
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,510
And he went out, and he came
back into the room, and he saw

289
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:56,880
that some mold, some fungus had
grown on this, kind of a

290
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,310
bluish-greenish fungus had grown
on the center of his

291
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,420
Petri dish.

292
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,690
And the bacteria, there was kind
of this space around it,

293
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,800
and the bacteria couldn't
get close to it.

294
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,580
And this mold, this fungus was
called Penicillium, the

295
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,730
Penicillium fungus.

296
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,680
He was able to figure
that out.

297
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,750
He took a sample of this and
then he cultured it, which

298
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,300
means letting it grow and
then seeing what it is.

299
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,810
This was Penicillium.

300
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,650
And he figured out that, gee,
this fungus must have

301
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,730
something, some chemical that
it's emitting that's

302
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,070
essentially killing the bacteria
around it, that's not

303
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,950
allowing the bacteria
to get near it.

304
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,775
And so that led to the discovery
of penicillin.

305
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,620
This was in the late
20s, 1920s.

306
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,420
By the time World War II came
around, now people had gunshot

307
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,890
wounds and they had to get
things amputated, whatnot, but

308
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,850
for the first time, they could
actually give people

309
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,970
antibiotics and not worry
about-- or they probably still

310
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,990
worried about it, but didn't
have to worry about this thing

311
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,670
as much as they did before.

312
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,970
And now, you know, if you have
bacteria, if you have

313
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,540
tuberculosis or Lyme disease or
anything, the treatment all

314
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,390
involves taking antibiotics.

315
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,600
And there are many, many more
types of antibiotics now

316
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,140
coming from many, many more
different sources, but the

317
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,570
general idea is the same.

318
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,520
You want to kill bacteria.

319
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,890
Although you don't want to kill
all bacteria, because

320
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,550
some of it's good.

321
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,190
In fact, we are made up a
whole lot of bacteria.

322
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,140
I don't know if I even
mentioned this

323
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,500
earlier in the video.

324
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,540
There's bacteria in our skin
that helps take up oil and

325
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,460
moisturizes and make our
skin nice and supple.

326
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,930
So, you know, the way you think
about it, you could view

327
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,000
them as negative or you could
view them as positive or you

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,050
could view them as something
in between, but the really

329
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,820
amazing thing, at least in my
mind, is that we're living in

330
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,980
symbiosis with them.

331
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,050
I remember I saw a Star Trek
episode once where you had

332
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,700
these people.

333
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,680
You had these people, and they
were some alien race.

334
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,430
Jean-Luc Picard had--
they ran into them.

335
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,470
They looked very humanoid
like that.

336
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,109
But it turns out-- let me draw
this human-- that they had

337
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,579
these little bugs in
their brain stem.

338
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,000
So they had these big insects in
their brain stem and these

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,310
insects started infecting the
crew of the Enterprise, and

340
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,099
they were controlling their
brains and making them act

341
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,450
weird and whatever not, and
this seemed like a very

342
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,069
bizarre alien concept of some
creepy-crawlie living in us

343
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,890
and affecting our brains and
affecting us in some ways.

344
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,060
But if you really think about
it, we are doing this, and

345
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,680
it's not just with one
little bug, it's on

346
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
the order of trillions.

347
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,540
Hundreds of trillions of bugs
are with us every day and they

348
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
make us us.

349
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,750
I mean, I'm here recording
videos along with-- or maybe I

350
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,040
should even say the bacteria
is recording videos or it's

351
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,250
maybe partially responsible
for controlling bacteria.

352
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,870
And it's known that the bacteria
can even affect our

353
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,910
mental state.

354
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,220
There's a whole bunch of
research now that certain

355
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,650
types of bacteria can
cause schizophrenia.

356
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,780
Actually, syphilis does.

357
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,920
Bacteria can cause depression.

358
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,400
Lyme disease, it's known that
when you go into later phases

359
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,660
of Lyme disease, it can affect
the mental condition of the

360
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,320
person who has the infection,
so it affects every part of

361
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,920
who we are.

362
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,100
I mean, it would be hard to
even talk of being a human

363
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,690
being without the 10% of our
mass or the 2,000 trillion

364
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,670
cells or 2,000 trillion
bacteria that

365
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,880
really make us us.

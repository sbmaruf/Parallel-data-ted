1
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:03,637
So we talked about
inhaling and exhaling.

2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:06,555
And I'd mentioned that the key
first step for both of them

3
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,316
is this change in volume,
going up in volume

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,800
or going down in volume.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,140
But I didn't really talk about
how that happens exactly,

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,010
so I thought I would
jump into that now.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,550
And let me begin by telling
you that in the middle

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,910
of your chest, you have this
enormous kind of bone that

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,870
goes down.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,760
And I'm drawing it
out of proportion just

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,500
to make it very clear
where this bone is.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,150
But you can go ahead and
feel on your own body

13
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,290
this bone, which we call
either the breastbone,

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,440
or the more technical
name is the sternum.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,030
So I'll write that down here.

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,960
The sternum is this middle bone,
and all the ribs on both sides

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,760
attach there.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,820
So you've got a total of 12
ribs and seven pairs of them.

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,400
Actually, I should
say 12 pairs of ribs.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,750
I don't want you to
think there are 12 total.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,540
We actually have 24 total
and seven pairs of the ribs.

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:04,120
So 14 ribs actually attach
directly to this sternum bone.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,730
So in white, these are the ribs.

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,692
And between the ribs,
you actually have muscle.

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,020
So I'm going to draw in some of
these muscles between the ribs.

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,060
And these muscles are all going
to have their own nerve that

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,340
allows them to contract.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,930
So these muscles are
controlled by your brain,

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,560
and their name-- let
me just jot down here

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
on the side-- is
intercostal muscle.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,220
And inter just means between, so
this is the name of the muscle.

32
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,920
And costal refers to the ribs.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
So when you see
that word costal,

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,870
you'll know we're
talking about the ribs.

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,940
So what's between the
ribs is these muscles,

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,100
intercostal muscles.

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,600
And they are going to
start moving outwards when

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,150
your brain says, hey, I
want to take a deep breath.

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,810
So these muscles are
going to contract.

40
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,810
The ribs, I should say,
are going to move outwards.

41
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,390
So these go out.

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,050
And you also have--
let me just make

43
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,440
a little bit of space on
this canvas-- another muscle

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,190
that kind of rides
down here and has

45
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,780
kind of an upside
down U shape to it.

46
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,210
So I'm drawing it
kind of like a dome.

47
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,070
You can think of it as a dome.

48
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,100
And this dome is the
floor-- if you remember,

49
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,774
we talked about the
floor of the thorax.

50
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,070
So this is, of course,
our diaphragm muscle.

51
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,850
So we've got our
diaphragm muscle.

52
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,460
And this one when it contracts,
instead of going out,

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,270
it's going to go down.

54
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,490
So it's going to
kind of flatten out.

55
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,880
And I can actually draw this.

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,380
If you can now just stick
with me for a moment,

57
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,190
I'm going to erase
this dome-like shape.

58
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,910
And I'm going to draw what it
looks like as it contracts.

59
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,830
So when it contracts, it's
actually going to be more flat.

60
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,120
And this flat diaphragm,
as you can see,

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,790
is now further down
than it used to be.

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,330
And as it goes down, all
of the structures that

63
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,720
are inside this space--
so the two lungs.

64
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,547
And of course, I didn't
draw the heart here.

65
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,410
But the heart would be kind
of in this cardiac notch.

66
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,770
If you want, maybe I could
even draw that heart here.

67
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,150
They're all going to kind
of physically move down.

68
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,810
So this is our
heart and our lungs.

69
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,630
They're physically going
to be kind of drawn

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,380
downwards and out.

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,470
They are going to also move out
as the intercostal muscles move

72
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,430
out.

73
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,890
So you have expansion
of these lungs.

74
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,480
That's basically the idea.

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,930
And if you were to kind of
zoom in on this to kind of see

76
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,820
exactly what this
expansion looks

77
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,690
like, when I say you have
more volume in the lungs,

78
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,150
really what I should be saying,
if I wanted to be more exact,

79
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,410
is that all the alveoli--
if these are the alveoli,

80
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,930
let's say this is
another branch.

81
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,800
And this is another
alveoli right here.

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,250
All these alveoli, they
are actually expanding.

83
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,490
And you have about
500 million alveoli.

84
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,320
If you can just kind of fathom
how big a number that is.

85
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,370
It's an enormous
number of alveoli.

86
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:02,832
And if I was actually
drawing them,

87
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,730
I would be here drawing forever.

88
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,690
It would take
forever to write out

89
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,510
this many different alveoli.

90
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,410
But basically what happens
is that when the ribs go out

91
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,730
and the diaphragm moves down,
these alveoli are actually

92
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,140
being pulled out.

93
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,320
They're actually
being pulled outwards,

94
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,410
so they are actually going
to be getting larger in size.

95
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,230
They literally look like
they've grown in size,

96
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,240
and this is what they look like.

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,610
And actually, if you were
to take an even closer look,

98
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,140
you'd see that these
alveoli have around them

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,320
a bunch of protein.

100
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,980
The cells around them
have a bunch of protein,

101
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,660
and this protein
is called elastin.

102
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,290
And you can guess
what elastin might do.

103
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,810
It has kind of a similar
sound to the word elastic.

104
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,650
And elastin is basically
kind of like a rubber band,

105
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,560
so you can kind of think of
elastin as a rubber band.

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,290
And when the muscles
move down and out

107
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,380
and the alveoli
are pulled open--

108
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,500
let me actually now scroll up,
because you can kind of go back

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,170
to the idea of inhaling--
what is happening, then?

110
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,070
Well, you have a couple
things happening.

111
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,490
One, you have muscles-- I'll
just write muscles contracting.

112
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,310
And when I say
muscles, you know I'm

113
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,200
talking about all those
intercostal muscles

114
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,760
in your diaphragm.

115
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,980
And as a result of the
muscles contracting,

116
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,360
you have now the alveoli
are stretched open.

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,870
So those rubber bands,
those elastin proteins,

118
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,380
are literally physically
being stretched opened.

119
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,950
And keep that in mind, because
what's going to happen then

120
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,600
is when the muscles
relax, which is

121
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,950
what happens when you
exhale, what do you

122
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,990
think is going to
happen to that elastin?

123
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,356
Well, if it's like
a rubber band,

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
if that's what I'm saying
it's going to be like,

125
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:01,969
then the alveoli
are going to recoil.

126
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,920
And that's actually
the driving force

127
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,130
for why the volume
goes back down.

128
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:08,707
So if you have a
bunch of rubber bands

129
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,950
that you're stretching
out-- let me actually

130
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,920
bring up the picture.

131
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
You'll see it really clearly.

132
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,080
If you're physically kind of
using your muscles to help

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,890
pull this stuff
open, then the moment

134
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,760
that you stop pulling
open, the moment

135
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,840
that you stop contracting
those muscles now

136
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,905
that you have a nice big
volume, what's going to happen?

137
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,520
Well, all these
elastin molecules

138
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,020
are going to snap back.

139
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,900
Let me do it with
a different color.

140
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,970
Let's do this color.

141
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,350
They're going to
snap back like this.

142
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,725
All that protein
is going to want

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,380
to snap back into
the original size.

144
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,470
And when they do, this
thing gets smaller.

145
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,490
So my alveoli goes back
to its original size,

146
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,870
which was much
smaller than this.

147
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,410
Let me actually just quickly
show that and show you

148
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,300
that even though contraction
is what opened up things,

149
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,680
it's the recoil
that brings things

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
back down to their normal size.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,670
And let me erase this to make
it kind of a neater drawing.

152
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,850
So you can see it now.

153
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,380
Inhaling, the way that we
actually increase the volume,

154
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,010
is by pulling things
open through contraction.

155
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,260
And this actually
requires energy.

156
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,300
Remember, you can't
contract a muscle

157
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,190
without spending
chemical energy.

158
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,070
So this takes chemical
energy, and we usually

159
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,980
think of this molecule ATP as
the specific type of chemical

160
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,680
energy we're going to use.

161
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,310
And to exhale, when
you reduce the volume,

162
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,250
it's going to be driven
by this elastic recoil.

163
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,480
So that's a type of
elastic potential energy.

164
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,290
So this process of
inhaling and exhaling

165
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,165
is really a little
different from each other.

166
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,230
On the one hand,
you're using ATP.

167
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,840
You're actually burning
through these molecules.

168
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,620
And then when you
exhale, you're actually

169

1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,990
In this video we're going to do
a couple of examples that

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,180
deal with parallel and
perpendicular lines.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,960
So you have parallel, you have
perpendicular, and, of course,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,129
you have lines that are
neither parallel nor

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:16,950
perpendicular.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,120
And just as a bit of review,
if you've never seen this

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,510
before, parallel lines,
they never intersect.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,170
So let me draw some axes.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,810
So if those are my coordinate
axes right there, that's my

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,360
x-axis, that is my y-axis.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,070
If this is a line that I'm
drawing in magenta, a parallel

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,480
line might look something
like this.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,710
It's not the exact same
line, but they have

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,530
the exact same slope.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,150
If this moves a certain amount,
if this change in y

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,070
over change in x is a certain
amount, this change in y over

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,000
change in x is the
same amount.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,620
And that's why they
never intersect.

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,030
So they have the same slope.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,290
Parallel lines have
the same slope.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,990
Perpendicular lines, depending
on how you want to view it,

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,640
they're kind of the opposite.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,610
Let's say that this
is some line.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,300
A line that is perpendicular
to that will not only

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,340
intersect the line, it will
intersect it at a right angle,

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,860
at a 90 degree angle.

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,420
And I'm not going to prove
it for you here.

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,270
I actually prove it in the
linear algebra playlist. But a

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,410
perpendicular line's slope--
so let's say that this one

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,110
right here, let's say that
yellow line has a slope of m.

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,940
Then this orange line, that's
perpendicular to the yellow

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,000
line, is going to have a slope
of negative 1 over m.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,310
Their slopes are going
to be the negative

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,690
inverse of each other.

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,410
Now, given this information,
let's look at a bunch of lines

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,600
and figure out if they're
parallel, if they're

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,980
perpendicular, or if
they are neither.

38
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,570
And to do that, we just have to
keep looking at the slopes.

39
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,690
So let's see, they say one
line passes through the

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,310
points, 4, negative 3,
and negative 8, 0.

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,039
Another line passes through
the points, negative 1,

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,670
negative 1, and negative 2, 6.

43
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,720
So let's figure out the slopes
of each of these lines.

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,680
So I'll first do this
one in pink.

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,700
So this slope right here,
so line 1, so I'll

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,790
call it slope 1.

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,780
Slope 1 is, let's just say it
is-- well, I'll take this as

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,590
the finishing point.

49
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,000
So negative 3 minus 0--
remember change in y--

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,130
negative 3 minus 0, over
4 minus negative 8.

51
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,250
So this is equal to negative 3
over-- this is the same thing

52
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,180
as 4 plus 8-- negative
3 over 12, which is

53
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,220
equal to negative 1/4.

54
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,750
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 3.

55
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,610
That's this line.

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,760
That's the first line.

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,870
Now, what about the
second line?

58
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,180
The slope for that second line
is, well, let's take, here,

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:16,780
negative 1 minus 6, over
negative 1 minus negative 2 is

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,230
equal to-- negative 1 minus 6 is
negative 7, over negative 1

61
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,620
minus negative 2.

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,750
That's the same thing as
negative 1 plus 2.

63
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,250
Well, that's just 1.

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,300
So the slope here
is negative 7.

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,410
So here, their slopes are
neither equal-- so they're not

66
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,390
parallel-- nor are
they the negative

67
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,440
inverse of each other.

68
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,180
So this is neither.

69
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,020
This is neither parallel
nor perpendicular.

70
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,350
So these two lines, they
intersect, but they're not

71
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,740
going to intersect at
a 90 degree angle.

72
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,210
Let's do a couple
more of these.

73
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,540
So I have here, once again, one
line passing through these

74
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,330
points, and then another line
passing through these points.

75
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,770
So let's just look
at their slopes.

76
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,010
So this one in the green,
what's the slope?

77
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,012
The slope of the green one, I'll
call that the first line.

78
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,329
We could say, let's
see, change in y.

79
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:23,030
So we could do negative 2
minus 14, over-- I did

80
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,120
negative 2 first, so I'll
do 1 first-- over 1

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,090
minus negative 3.

82
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,140
So negative 2 minus
14 is negative 16.

83
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,200
1 minus negative 3 is the
same things as 1 plus 3.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,460
That's over 4.

85
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,000
So this is negative 4.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,610
Now, what's the slope of that
second line right there?

87
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,420
So we have the slope of
that second line.

88
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:57,070
Let's say 5 minus negative 3,
that's our change in y, over

89
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,490
negative 2 minus 0.

90
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,330
So this is equal to 5
minus negative 3.

91
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,540
That's the same thing
as 5 plus 3.

92
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,210
That's 8.

93
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,460
And then negative 2 minus
0 is negative 2.

94
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,700
So this is also equal
to negative 4.

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,280
So these two lines
are parallel.

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,660
They have the exact
same slope.

97
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,890
And I encourage you to find the
equations of both of these

98
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,790
lines and graph both of these
lines, and verify for yourself

99
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,060
that they are indeed parallel.

100
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,750
Let's do this one.

101
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,210
Once again, this is just an
exercise in finding slope.

102
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,190
So this first line
has those points.

103
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,080
Let's figure out its slope.

104
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,480
The slope of this first
line, one line passes

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
through these points.

106
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,480
So let's see, 3 minus negative
3, that's our change in y,

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,240
over 3 minus negative 6.

108
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
So this is the same thing as 3
plus 3, which is 6, over 3

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
plus 6, which is 9.

110
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,300
So this first line has
a slope of 2/3.

111
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,590
What is the second
line's slope?

112
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,230
This was the second line there,
that's the other line

113
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,890
passing through these points.

114
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,550
So the other line's slope,
let's see, we could say

115
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:27,340
negative 8 minus 4, over
2 minus negative 6.

116
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,720
So what is this equal to?

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,150
Negative 8 minus 4
is negative 12.

118
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,140
2 minus negative 6, that's the
same thing as 2 plus 6.

119
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,610
The negatives cancel out.

120
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,260
So it's negative 12 over 8,
which is the same thing if we

121
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,070
divide the numerator and the
denominator by 4, that's

122
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,320
negative 3/2.

123
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,120
Notice, these guys
are the negative

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,740
inverse of each other.

125
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,850
If I take negative 1 over 2/3,
that is equal to negative 1

126
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,870
times 3/2, which is equal
to negative 3/2.

127
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,350
These guys are the negative
inverses of each other.

128
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,300
You swap the numerator and the
denominator, make them

129
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,430
negative, and they become
equal to each other.

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,580
So these two lines are
perpendicular.

131
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,150
And I encourage you to find the
equations-- I already got

132
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,560
the slopes for you-- but find
the equations of both of these

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,090
lines, plot them, and verify
for yourself that they are

134
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,620
perpendicular.

135
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,580
Let's do one more.

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,890
Find the equation of a line
perpendicular to this line

137
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,590
that passes through the
point 2 comma 8.

138
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,440
So this first piece of
information, that it's

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,650
perpendicular to that line right
over there, what does

140
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,810
that tell us?

141
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,330
Well, if it's perpendicular to
this line, its slope has to be

142
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,950
the negative inverse of 2/5.

143
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,920
So its slope, the negative
inverse of 2/5, the inverse of

144
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,510
2/5 is-- let me do it in a
better color, a nicer green.

145
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,870
If this line's slope is negative
2/5, the equation of

146
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,610
the line we have to figure out
that's perpendicular, its

147
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,970
slope is going to
be the inverse.

148
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,180
So instead of 2/5, it's
going to be 5/2.

149
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,580
Instead of being a negative,
it's going to be a positive.

150
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,170
So this is a negative inverse
of negative 2/5.

151
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,580
Right?

152
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,240
You take the negative sign
and it becomes positive.

153
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,690
You swap the 5 and the
2, you get 5/2.

154
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,600
So that is going to have
to be our slope.

155
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,430
And we can actually use the
point-slope form right here.

156
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,850
It goes through this
point right there.

157
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,580
So let's use point-slope form.

158
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,220
y minus this y-value, which
has to be on the line, is

159
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,880
equal to our slope, 5/2 times
x minus this x-value, the

160
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,220
x-value when y is equal to 8.

161
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,740
And this is the equation of the
line in point-slope form.

162
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,940
If you want to put it in
slope-intercept form, you can

163
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,960
just do a little bit of
algebra, algebraic

164
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,910
manipulation. y minus 8 is equal
to-- let's distribute

165
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,960
the 5/2-- so 5/2 x minus--
5/2 times 2 is just-- 5.

166
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,570
And then add 8 to both sides.

167
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,900
You get y is equal to 5/2x.

168
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,635
Add 8 to negative
5, so plus 3.

169
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:12,340
And we are done.

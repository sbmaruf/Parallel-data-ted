1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,080
I'D LIKE YOU TO TRY SOMETHING FOR ME

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,840
I WANT YOU TO TRY AND IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT
MONEY..

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,419
A WORLD THAT DOESN'T USE MONEY AT ALL

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:15,789
NO BANKS, NO CASH, NO WAGES, NO BILLS.
NO MONEY OF ANY KIND OF WHATSOEVER

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,639
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

6
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,119
LET ME GUESS..

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,409
MAYBE YOU IMAGINE EVERYONE GOING BACK TO A MORE
PRIMITIVE LIFESTYLE

8
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:26,750
LIVING A MEAGRE EXISTENCE GROWING OUR OWN CROPS
AND LIVESTOCK..

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,630
KIND OF LIKE PEASANTS.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,519
OR, MAYBE YOU SEE A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIETY

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,040
NO LAWS OR SOCIAL ORDER

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,109
WITH PEOPLE DESPERATE, OR TOO LAZY TO GROW THEIR
OWN FOOD

13
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,630
STEALING FROM OTHERS

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,210
OR MAYBE EVEN KILLING EACH OTHER TO SURVIVE

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,100
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE PROSPECT, DOES IT?

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,880
WELL SUPPOSING I TOLD YOU THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,190
THAT IN FACT A DELIBERATE DECISION TO STOP
USING MONEY

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,400
WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE OUR LIVES MANY TIMES BETTER
THAN THEY ARE NOW

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,870
LOOK AT YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,620
JUST HOW FREE ARE YOU?

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,380
DO YOU OWE MONEY TO ANYONE OR TO A BANK?
A CREDIT CARD DEBT OR A MORTGAGE MAYBE?

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,310
YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE THESE THINGS CAN YOU?

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,310
YOU MAY END UP LOSING YOUR HOME
OR MAYBE EVEN GOING TO JAIL!

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,350
WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB?

25
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,610
IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND YOU LOVE IT, GREAT BUT..

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,220
MOST PEOPLE ONLY WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,580
YOU HAVE TO WORK TO PAY YOUR BILLS

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,300
IF YOU DON'T WORK THE LIGHTS GO OUT,
THE WATER GETS TURNED OFF..

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,230
THE PHONE'S DISCONNECTED, YOU CAN'T BUY FOOD TO EAT!

30
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,630
SO YOUâ€™RE NOT REALLY THAT FREE AT ALL, ARE YOU?

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,389
LIKE MOST PEOPLE YOU PROBABLY THINK THAT THIS
IS SIMPLY A FACT OF LIFE

32
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:46,090
WE HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE MONEY TO LIVE

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,480
JUST LIKE OUR PARENTS DID.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,950
WELL LET ME TELL YOU THIS IS NOT A FACT OF LIFE
ANYMORE

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,040
LET ME EXPLAIN WHY..

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,400
FIRSTLY, BEAR IN MIND THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED MONEY,
WE JUST NEED TO THINGS THAT MONEY BUYS FOR US..

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,860
LIKE FOOD, CLOTHING, A HOME, ELECTRICITY, PHONE,
COMPUTER, ETC.

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,439
MONEY ITSELF IS JUST A MIDDLEMAN

39
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,319
WHICH ON IT'S OWN IS COMPLETELY USELESS

40
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,199
AND JUST CAUSES MISERY TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH OF IT.

41
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,999
NOW, WITH TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY

42
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:24,309
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING WE PRODUCE FOR OURSELVES
IS DONE BY MACHINES AND COMPUTERS

43
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:28,359
IN FACT THIS IS THE VERY REASON WHY WE HAVE
HUGE UNEMPLOYMENT EVERYWHERE..

44
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,659
THE MACHINES ARE TAKING ALL OUR JOBS!

45
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,809
BUT IF YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT THAT

46
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:36,849
THIS IS REALLY A GOOD THING!

47
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:43,849
TECHNOLOGY HAS COMPLETELY FREED US FROM HARD
LABOUR. WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THAT FACT

48
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:48,140
SO IF WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE TO PRODUCE THE STUFF
WE CONSUME

49
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,239
THEN IT SURELY FOLLOWS THAT PRODUCING THESE
THINGS IS A VERY EASY THING TO DO

50
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,790
AND IF PRODUCING STUFF IS EASY

51
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,719
THEN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL WHY
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT FOR EVERYBODY IS THERE?

52
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,559
AND NOT JUST THE ONES WHO CAN PAY.

53
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:08,729
AT THE MOMENT OUR ECONOMY IS ALL ABOUT MOVING
MONEY AROUND, AND NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUALLY

54
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,969
GIVING US WHAT WE NEED

55
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,249
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE DOES IT?

56
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:19,309
THE ONLY CONSTRAINTS TO PRODUCING THE GOODS WE
NEED SHOULD BE WHAT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE AND

57
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:23,169
NOT WHAT'S AFFORDABLE!

58
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,539
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, OUR PLANET HAS PLENTY OF RESOURCES
TO PROVIDE FOR EVERYONE..

59
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,459
THE ONLY THING WE'RE SHORT OF, IT SEEMS,
IS MONEY!

60
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,719
SO WHY NOT JUST MAKE EVERYTHING FREE?

61
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,010
FORGET ABOUT MONEY ALTOGETHER!

62
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,139
WHY NOT?

63
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,619
IT'S OUR WORLD, WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN RULES

64
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:46,120
THE ONLY THING MONEY CREATES IS INEQUALITY

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,819
A SCORING SYSTEM FOR HUMANITY THAT DECIDES WHO
GETS WHAT

66
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,879
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OUR TECHNOLOGY
ALLOWS US TO DO AWAY WITH THIS NOTION OF

67
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,359
'HAVES' AND 'HAVE NOTS'

68
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,529
AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING..

69
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:05,259
MAKING OUR WORLD FREE WOULD UNLEASH OUR FULL
TECHNICAL POTENTIAL

70
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,269
ALLOW US TO TAP INTO CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES

71
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,309
BRING MEANINGFUL PROSPERITY AND KNOWLEDGE
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD

72
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:16,639
AND BRING AN END TO WAR AND INJUSTICE FOREVER

73
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,789
JUST IMAGINE

74
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,889
FOOD PRODUCED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AND IN
PLENTIFUL SUPPLY

75
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,500
BIGGER, BETTER HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS WITH NO
BUDGET PROBLEMS

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,979
CLEAN ENERGY AND COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABLE
TO EVERYONE

77
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,030
SPACE EXPLORATION

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,939
UNDERWATER CITIES

79
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,940
WHO KNOWS?

80
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,550
TAKE AWAY COST, AND THE ONLY LIMIT IS OUR
IMAGINATION AND THE RAW MATERIALS NEEDED

81
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,769
TO MAKE WHATEVER WE WANT

82
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,080
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY

83
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,649
IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY

84
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,180
BASICALLY, YOU DIE

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,599
THIS IS NOT JUST WRONG,
IT'S COMPLETELY IMMORAL

86
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,500
BECAUSE IT'S UNNECESSARY

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,340
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY,
A NEW WAY

88
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,879
A FREE WORLD WITHOUT MONEY

89
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,179
WHERE EVERYTHING IS FREE

90
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,039
WHERE YOU ARE FREE

91
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,610
WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE FOR EVERYONE, AND
FINALLY SEE AN END TO STARVATION

92
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,029
WHERE SOCIETY IS AS FAIR AS IT CAN
POSSIBLY BE

93
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,970
WHERE TECHNOLOGY, UNHINDERED BY COST

94
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,139
IS SO ADVANCED THAT WE WOULD HARDLY
RECOGNISE OURSELVES!

95
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,029
AND IT'S ALL POSSIBLE NOW

96
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,960
IF WE CHOOSE IT

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,500
THE FREE WORLD CHARTER

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:42,500
DEFINES TEN FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ON WHICH
TO BUILD JUST SUCH A SOCIETY

99
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,539
THESE PRICIPLES ARE NOT RULES OR LAWS

100
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,110
THEY'RE JUST SIMPLE STATEMENTS ON

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,330
COMMON-SENSE, THE COMMON GOOD

102
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,449
AND THE SURVIVAL OF US AND OUR PLANET.

103
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,439
A SOCIETY FAITHFUL TO THESE PRINCIPLES

104
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,759
WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE NO NEED FOR LAWS

105

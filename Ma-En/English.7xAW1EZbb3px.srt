ANDERSON COOPER: Welcome to
the AC 360 Google+ page.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,400
Add us to your circle so you can
get the latest updates and

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,790
behind the scenes look
at the show.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,150
BOB SCHIEFFER: We're going to be
conducting Google hangouts,

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,080
from time to time, to connect
people in every corner of the

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,320
country to talk about topics
related to campaign 2012.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,240
Sarah, you're the reporter in
this crowd, what is going on

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,130
with religion these days in
the age of the internet?

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,220
SARAH: We were talking about how
religion is surviving in

10
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:28,715
this new age.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,370
And I'd say it's actually
thriving.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,910
MARIA BATRIROMO: I'm Maria
Bartiromo with the New York

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,600
Stock Exchange.

14
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,184
A big shout out to all my
friends on Google+.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,610
DOUG GOTTLIEB: When you think
back Saturday, semifinals what

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,040
just, kind of, pops
into your mind?

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,080
MALE SPEAKER: Uneven play.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,370
MALE SPEAKER: The Kentucky
Louisville game especially.

19
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,665
It was just sloppy all
the way around.

20
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,680
DOUG GOTTLIEB: I thought the
first game was totally

21
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:45,825
entertaining.

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,080
You guys are all nuts.

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,410
FEMALE SPEAKER: NBC Bay Area's,
George Kiriyama, is

24
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,610
live at SFO, and he's live via
Google+ with us right now,

25
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,070
because it's too dangerous to
use our live truck with the

26
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,380
mast going up there, so
he's talking to us

27
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,180
live over the internet.

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,230
George, what can you tell us?

29
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,920
GEORGE KIRIYAMA: We have
61 flights canceled.

30
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,900
SARAH HILL: We wanted to say
thanks to everyone who was on

31
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,190
our cyber count today.

32
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,180
We hope that you enjoy
your weekend.

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,460
ANGIE BAILEY: Good evening,
I'm Angie Bailey.

34
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,530
SARAH HILL: And I'm
Sarah Hill.

35
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,110
Thanks for joining us.

36
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,760
KOMU's Kristin James worked that
story on Brian Rankins.

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,440
JAKE TAPPER: I'm Jake Tapper,
I'm the senior White House

38
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,850
correspondent for ABC News.

39
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,440
Welcome to this week's inaugural
Google+ hang out for

40
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,830
a discussion of election
year politics.

41
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,320
So Emily, I think you
have the next one.

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,970
And your question is about
the US Supreme Court.

43
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,980
EMILY: If the Supreme Court
rules that all or a portion of

44
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,000
Obamacare is unconstitutional,
are there any positives that

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,380
President Obama could get
out of that decision?

46
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,960
MALE SPEAKER: I think whatever
happens, it's probably not

47
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,890
going to be determinative
of this election.

48
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,690
I think, though, there's a
benefit to President Obama if

49
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,380
that happens.

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,910
CHRISTINA BELLANTONI: Anybody
that has Google+ can use it.

51
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:47,566
It's sort of the concept of a
watch party at home where

52
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,510
you'd be watching a speech on
your couch except you use it

53
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,431
from your laptop.

54
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,206
It was definitely the
magic of technology

55
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:53,035
that made it happen.

56
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:55,536
If you can bring people in to
be able to talk about the

57
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:57,125
issues that are driving
the day.

58
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,030
BOB SCHIEFFER: I think this
is going to be terrific.

59
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,080

1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,580
J.T. loves burgers and loves to

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,320
subscribes to a cell phone
texting plan with three other

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,760
members of his family.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,160
Within any given month, they
cannot send more than 500 text

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,040
messages total.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,330
So they cannot send more than
500 text messages total.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,370
At the end of this month, J.T.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,500
had sent 25 more texts than
his older sister.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,310
Let me highlight.

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,140
Let me do this in different
colors.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,540
So at the end of
the month, J.T.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,870
had sent 25 more texts than
his older sister, 50 fewer

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:41,860
texts than his younger
sister, and 125 more

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,010
texts than his mother.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,430
How may texts could J.T.

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:55,130
have sent if they did not go
over the 500-text limit?

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,030
So let's just define some
variables over here.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,790
Well, let's say o.s.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,120
o dot s is, well let's just say
o, o is for older sister.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,383
So this is number of texts
by older sister.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,420
Let's say that y is equal
to number of texts

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,670
by his younger sister.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:37,150
And then we'll use m is
equal to the number of

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,910
texts by his mother.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,540
And we'll use j for a number
of texts by J.T.

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,400
So the total number of texts
that everyone sent cannot be

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,910
more than 500.

28
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,140
So if we take the sum of J.T.'s
texts, plus his older

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,360
sister's texts, plus his younger
sister's texts, plus

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,580
his mother's texts, they all
have to be less than or equal

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,410
to 500 total texts.

32
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,420
Right, it can't be more than
500, so the sum has to be less

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,230
than or equal to 500.

34
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,290
Now, how can we express each
of these in terms of the

35
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,410
number of texts J.T.

36
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,790
sent?

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,060
Well, they give us some
information here.

38
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,560
This first statement, J.T.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,910
had sent 24 more texts than
his older sister.

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:39,570
So j is equal to 25 plus the
number of texts of his older

41
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,550
sister, which we say is o.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,640
It's not a 0, that's an
o for older sister.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,250
And they also tell
us that J.T.

44
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,510
sent 50 fewer texts than his
younger sister, so j is also

45
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,130
equal to the younger sister
minus 50, right?

46
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,600
50 fewer texts than his
younger sister.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,880
And then finally, they say 125
more texts than his mother, so

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,410
j is equal to mother plus 125.

49
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,250
Now, I want this equation all
in terms of j's, because we

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,430
want to say how many
texts could J.T.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,140
have sent.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,990
So I want all of these expressed
in j, so let's just

53
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,600
solve each of these for o in
terms of j, solve for y in

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,110
terms of j, solve for m in terms
of j, and then we can

55
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,910
substitute back over here.

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,640
So if j is equal to 25 plus o,
if we subtract 25 from both

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,920
sides of this equation, we get
j minus 25 is equal to o.

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,460
These are the same thing.

59
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,090
If you just take this and
subtract 25 from both sides,

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,490
you get that right there.

61
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,160
Now here, if you add 50 to both
sides of this equation,

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,000
if you add to 50 to both sides
of this equation, j plus 50 is

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,840
equal to the number of texts
that his younger sister sent.

64
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,520
I just added 50 to both sides.

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,490
And then over here, if you
subtract 125 from both sides

66
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,570
of this equation-- scroll over a
little bit-- if you subtract

67
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,130
125 from both sides, you get
j minus 125 is equal to the

68
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,210
number of texts sent
by his mother.

69
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,370
And we could have gone
straight here.

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,829
This first statement, J.T. has
sent 25 more texts than is

71
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,730
older sister.

72
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,290
So if you take the number
of texts J.T.

73
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,620
sent, subtracted 25, you'd get
the number of texts by his

74
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,430
older sister.

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,320
That is an o, it is not a 0.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
o for older.

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,600
Likewise, he sent 50 fewer texts
than his younger sister,

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,150
so if you took the number of
texts he sent, add 50 to it,

79
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,560
you're going to get how many his
younger sister had sent.

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,545
And then finally, he sent 125
more than his mother, so if

81
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:42,010
you took J.T.'s texts, you take
out 125, then that's how

82
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,750
many his mother sent.

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,180
So now that we have this, we
can substitute for each of

84
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,530
these variables into the
original equation.

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,505
So you have J.T.'s texts, plus
his older sister's texts.

86
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:56,790
But we know that o is the same
thing as J.T.'s texts minus

87
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,080
25, so we write J.T.'s
texts minus 25.

88
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,920
And then you have plus his
younger sister's texts, but we

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,650
know that's J.T.'s
texts plus 50.

90
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,540
And then you have his mother's
texts, but his mother's texts

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,680
are just J.T.'s texts minus
125, so plus j minus 125.

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,560
And all of that has to be less
than or equal to 500.

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,590
So let's add the j's.

94
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,290
We have 1, 2, 3, 4 j's,
so you have 4 j's.

95
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,880
And let's add the constants.

96
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,520
You have a negative 25 plus
a 50, which is 25.

97
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,140
And then you have 25 minus
125, so 25 minus 125 is

98
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,010
negative 100.

99
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,120
So 4j minus 100-- I just added
all the constant terms-- has

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,610
to be less than or
equal to 500.

101
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,810
And now this is a pretty
straightforward inequality.

102
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:05,030
Add 100 to both sides and we get
4j-- these cancel out-- we

103
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,530
get 4j is less than
or equal to 600.

104
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,640
Divide both sides by 4-- don't
have to worry about the

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,080
inequality since 4 is a positive
number-- and we get j

106
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,850
is less than or equal to 150.

107
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,720
So J.T.

108
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,560
had to send less than or equal,
he had to send 150 or

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,210
fewer texts in that month in
order for all the constraints

110
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,280
to match up and for the family
as a combined unit to send

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,630
less than 500.

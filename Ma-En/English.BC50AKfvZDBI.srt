1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,050
In the last video,
we did some examples

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,670
where we had one digit
repeating on and on forever,

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,750
and we were able to convert
those into fractions.

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,540
In this video, we want to tackle
something a little bit more

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,670
interesting, which is
multiple digits repeating

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,150
on and on forever.

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's say I had
0.36 repeating, which

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,130
is the same thing as 0 point--
since the bar's over the 3

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,920
and the 6, both of
those repeat-- 363636.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,720
And it just keeps going on and
on and on like that forever.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,560
Now the key to doing
this type of problem

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,360
is, so like we did
in the last video,

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,800
we set this as equal to x.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,990
And instead of just
multiplying it by 10-- 10

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,070
would only shift
it one over-- we

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,370
want to shift it over enough
so that when we line them up,

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,440
the decimal parts will still
line up with each other.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,430
And to do that we,
want to actually shift

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,720
the decimal space
two to the right.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,070
And to shift it
two to the right,

22
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,030
we have to have multiplied by
100 or 10 to the second power.

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,460
So 100x is going to
be equal to what?

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,660
We're shifting this two
to the right-- one, two.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,100
So 100x is going to be equal
to-- the decimal is going

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,230
to be there now, so it's
going to be 36.363636

27
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,850
on and on and on forever.

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,350
And then let me
rewrite x over here.

29
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,550
We're going to subtract
that from the 100x.

30
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:29,690
x is equal to 0.363636
repeating on and on forever.

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,315
And notice when we multiplied by
100x, the 3's and the 6's still

32
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,440
line up with each other
when we align the decimals.

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,815
And you want to
make sure you get

34
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:39,402
the decimals lined
up appropriately.

35
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,860
And the reason why
this is valuable

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,350
is now that when we
subtract x from 100x,

37
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,000
the repeating parts
will cancel out.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
So let's subtract.

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,170
Let us subtract
these two things.

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,170
So on the left-hand side,
we have 100x minus x.

41
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,100
So that gives us 99x.

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,650
And then we get, on
the right-hand side,

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,300
this part cancels
out with that part.

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,930
And we're just left with 36.

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,900
We can divide both
sides by 99, and we

46
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,240
are left with x is
equal to 36 over 99.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,110
And both the numerator and the
denominator is divisible by 9,

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,390
so we can reduce this.

49
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,930
If we divide the
numerator by 9, we get 4.

50
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,280
The denominator
by 9-- we get 11.

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,760
So 0.363636 forever and
forever repeating is 4/11.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,960
Now let's do another
interesting one.

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:48,340
Let's say we have the number
0.714, and the 14 is repeating.

54
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,110
And so this is the same thing.

55
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,160
So notice, the 714
isn't going to repeat.

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,250
Just the 14 is going to repeat.

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,690
So this is 0.7141414,
on and on and on and on.

58
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,910
So let's set this equal to x.

59
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,330
Now you might be tempted to
multiply this by 1,000x to get

60
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,556
the decimal all the
way clear of 714.

61
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:14,180
But you actually
don't want to do that.

62
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,670
You want to shift it just enough
so that the repeating pattern

63
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,751
can be right under itself
when you do the subtraction.

64
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,500
So again in this
situation, even though we

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,640
have three numbers
behind the decimal point,

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,390
because only two of
them are repeating,

67
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,350
we only want to multiply
by 10 to the second power.

68
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,010
So once again, you want
to multiply by 100.

69
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,250
So you get 100x is equal to--
we're moving the decimal two

70
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,680
to the right, one,
two-- so it's going

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,360
to be 71.4141, on
and on and on and on.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:52,810
So it's going to be 71.4141414
and on and on and on.

73
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,770
And then let me rewrite
x right below this.

74
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:00,380
We have x is equal to 0.7141414.

75
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,340
And notice, now the
141414's, they're

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,040
lined up right below each other.

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,190
So it's going to work
out when we subtract.

78
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,170
So let's subtract these things.

79
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,230
100x minus x is 99x.

80
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,750
And this is going to be equal
to-- these 1414's are going

81
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,600
to cancel with those 1414's.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,800
And we have 71.4 minus 0.7.

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,860
And we can do this in our head,
or we can borrow if you like.

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,330
This could be a 14.

85
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,620
This is a 0.

86
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,310
So you have 14 minus 7
is 7 and then 70 minus 0.

87
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,260
So you have 99x
is equal to 70.7.

88
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,300
And then we can divide
both sides by 99.

89
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,110
And you could see all of
the sudden something strange

90
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,985
is happening because we
still have a decimal.

91
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,470
But we can fix
that up at the end.

92
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,145
So let's divide
both sides by 99.

93
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:51,380

94
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,534
You get x is equal
to 70.7 over 99.

95
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,200
Now obviously, we
haven't converted this

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,300
into a pure fraction yet.

97
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,190
We still have a decimal
in the numerator.

98
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,840
But that's pretty easy to fix.

99
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,170
You just have to multiply the
numerator and denominator by 10

100
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,320
to get rid of this decimal.

101
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,270
So let's multiply the numerator
by 10 and the denominator

102
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,280
by 10.

103
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:19,780
And so we get 707/990.

104
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,640
Let's do one more
example over here.

105
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,810
So let's say we had something
like-- let me write this way--

106
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:35,710
3.257 repeating, and we want to
convert this into a fraction.

107
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,080
So once again, we
set this equal to x.

108
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,400
And notice, this is
going to be 3.257257257.

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,730
The 257 is going to
repeat on and on and on.

110
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,690
Since we have three
digits that are repeating,

111
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,660
we want to think about 1,000x,
10 to the third power times x.

112
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,560
And that'll let us
shift it just right

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,080
so that the repeating
parts can cancel out.

114
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,157
So 1,000x is going
to be equal to what?

115
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,740
We're going to shift
the decimal three

116
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,500
to the right-- one, two, three.

117
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,490
So it's going to
be 3,257 point--

118
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,180
and then the 257
keeps repeating.

119
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,390
257257257 keeps going on
and on and on forever.

120
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,850
And then we're going to
subtract x from that.

121
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,231
So here is x. x is equal to 3.

122
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,480
You want to make sure you
have your decimals lined up.

123
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:33,060
It's 3.257257257 dot, dot,
dot-- keeps going on forever.

124
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,100
And notice, when we
multiplied it by 1,000,

125
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,690
it allowed us to line up the
257's so that when we subtract,

126
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,790
the repeating part cancels out.

127
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,050
So let's do that subtraction.

128
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,004
On the left-hand side,
1,000 of something

129
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,420
minus 1 of that
something-- you're

130
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,590
left with 999 of that something.

131
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,110
This part is going to
cancel out with that part.

132
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,650
It's going to be equal to--
let's see, 7 minus 3 is 4.

133
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,810
And then you have the
5, the 2, and the 3.

134
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,240
So you get 999x
is equal to 3,254.

135
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:15,830
And then you can divide
both sides of this by 999.

136
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:23,590
And you are left with x
is equal to 3,254/999.

137
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,590
And so obviously, this
is an improper fraction.

138
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,690
The numerator is larger
than the denominator.

139
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,414
You could convert this to a
proper fraction if you like.

140
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,830
One way, you could
have just tried

141
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,820
to figure out what to the 0.257
repeating forever is equal to

142
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,540
and just had the 3
being the whole number

143
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,600
part of a mixed fraction.

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,460
Or you could just
divide 999 into 3,254.

145
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,690
Actually, we could do that
pretty straightforwardly.

146
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,290
It goes into it three times,
and the remainder-- well,

147
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,010
let me just do it, just
to go through the motions.

148
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,660
So 999 goes into 3,254.

149
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,400
It'll go into it three times.

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,160
And we know that because
this is originally 3.257,

151
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,910
so we're just going
to find the remainder.

152
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,645
So 3 times 9 is 27.

153
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:08,020

154
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,450
But we have to add
the 2, so it's 29.

155
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,650
3 times 9 is 27.

156
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,040
We have a 2, so it's 29.

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,310
And so we are left
with, if we subtract,

158
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,220
if we regroup or borrow or
however we want to call it,

159
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,860
this could be a 14.

160
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,201
And then this could be a 4.

161
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,450
Let me do this in a new color.

162
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,000

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,490
And then the 4 is still
smaller than this 9,

164
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,770
so we need to regroup again.

165
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,240
So then this could be a 14,
and then this could be a 1.

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,020
But this is smaller
than this 9 right

167
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,000
over here, so we regroup again.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,780
This would be an 11,
and then this is a 2.

169
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,580
14 minus 7 is 7.

170
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,782
14 minus 9 is 5.

171
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,740
11 minus 9 is 2.

172
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,520
So we are left with--
did I do that right?

173
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,580
Yep-- so this is going to
be equal to 3 and 257/999.

174
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,520
And we're done.

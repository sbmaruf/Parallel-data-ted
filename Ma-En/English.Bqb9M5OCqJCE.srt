00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,000
You.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Look at your eyes.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,200
Look at them.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,100
Speckled.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,000
Colorful.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Each one unique.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I created every one of them.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,100
I created -- everything.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,000
The universe.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
And you.

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I gave you your personality.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I made you pure.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,300
Complex.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,300
And every day

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,200
I give you life.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
I love you.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,500
But something happened.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
You cheated on me.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,000
You didn't trust me.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
You sinned.

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,500
You cut yourself off from me.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
And although you're still alive...

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,200
you are slowly dying.

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,500
So you looked for other things...

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,000
It just kills you faster.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,000
And it separates us more and more...

I don't want you to die.

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,400
I created you.

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,300
Not to be destroyed.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But to know me.

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,000
So I became one of you.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
A fragile creation.

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
I was tempted.

48
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,100
But I never sinned.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,100
I came to save you.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,300
You have so many sins.

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
And they have a cost.

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,900
Someone has to die.

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,000
You --

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
or Me.

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
So I took on your sin.

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,000
And traded in my life for yours.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
And I died,

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
in your place.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because I love you.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Then --

61
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,800
I rose from the dead.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I am the Way.

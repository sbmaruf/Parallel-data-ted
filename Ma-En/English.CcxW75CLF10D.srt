1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,805
At this point I think you know a little bit about what multiplication is.

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,025
Or "multi"-plication.

3
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:13,315
What we're going to do in this video is to give you just a ton of more practice,

4
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:17,706
and start you on your memorization of the multiplication tables.

5
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,009
And if you watch enough Khan Academy videos,

6
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,279
and hopefully you will in the future,

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,540
you'll realize that I'm normally not a big fan of memorization.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,385
But the one thing about multiplication

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:31,220
is if you memorize your multiplication tables that we'll start to do in this video,

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,850
it'll pay huge benefits the rest of your life.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,724
So I promise you, do it now, you'll never forget it,

12
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:39,547
and the rest of your life everything will be--

13
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,517
well, I don't want to make false promises to you,

14
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:45,790
but they'll be better than if you didn't memorize your multiplication tables.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,290
So what are the multiplication tables?

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,745
Well that's all of the different numbers

17
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:50,850
times each other.

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,590
So let's actually do a little bit of review.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,900
So if I say, what is two times one?

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,270
That is equal to two plus itself one time.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,010
So this is equal to just two.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,060
That's two plus itself one time.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,059
I don't have to say plus anything

24
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:09,430
because there's only one two there.

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,460
I could also write this as one plus itself two times.

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,390
So that's also one plus one.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,580
Well that also equals two.

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,210
Fair enough.

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,901
So two times one is two.

30
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:22,722
And if you watched the last video, what's two times zero?

31
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:23,516
Well that's zero.

32
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,660
So you don't have to memorize your zero multiplication tables

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,560
because everything times zero is zero, or zero times anything is zero.

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,090
So let's see.

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,682
What's two times two?

36
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:35,988
Two times two.

37
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:37,254
Well, this is equal to--

38
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:39,460
we're going to add two to itself two times.

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,830
So that's two plus two.

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,770
And there's only a way to do that.

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,480
I could say take this two and add it to itself two times,

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,680
but it's the same thing.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,610
And what's two plus two?

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,450
That's equal to four.

45
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,400
What's two times three?

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,900
Two times three is equal to two plus two plus two.

47
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,355
It can also be equal to three plus three.

48
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:04,905
We learned in a previous video

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,498
this statement can be written either of these ways.

50
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,380
And in either case, what's it equal to?

51
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:10,282
Well three plus three

52
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,028
is the same thing as two plus two plus two,

53
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,774
and that's equal to six.

54
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:15,812
All right.

55
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:18,138
Now what is two times four?

56
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:20,686
Two times four.

57
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:26,065
Well that's equal to two plus two plus two plus two.

58
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:29,870
And notice, it's exactly what two times three was.

59
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,610
Two times three was that.

60
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,490
I have that here, but now I'm just adding another two to it.

61
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,740
So if we're too lazy to sit here and add two plus two is four.

62
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,710
Four plus two is six.

63
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,802
Instead of doing that, we could say,

64
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:45,680
hey look, we already know that this thing over here, this was six.

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,300
We figured it out in the previous line right there.

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,550
We figured out this is six, so we could just say, oh, two times four

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,610
is going to be two more than that, which is equal to eight.

68
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,480
And you should hopefully see that pattern.

69
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,907
As we go from two times one, to two times two,

70
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:03,760
to two times three, what's happening?

71
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,500
How much are we going up by?

72
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,120
From two to four we're going plus two.

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,300
From four to six we're going plus two.

74
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,340
And then from six to eight we're going plus two.

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,685
So you could figure out what two times five is,

76
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:16,950
even without doing the addition.

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,430
Two times five is equal to two plus two plus two plus two plus two.

78
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,070
It could also be written as five plus five.

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,110
Two times four could've been written as four plus four as well.

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,490
And what's that equal to?

81
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,090
We could add all of these up or we could add these two up.

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,285
Or we could just say it's going to be two more than two times four.

83
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:38,564
So it's going to be ten.

84
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:41,780
I'll finish the two times tables.

85
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,280
And I think you see all of the patterns that emerge from it.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,710
So two times six.

87
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,580
That's going to be two plus itself six times.

88
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:55,369
Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six,

89
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,690
which should also be equal to six plus itself two times.

90
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,620
This could be interpreted either way.

91
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,980
And that's going to be equal to twelve.

92
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,898
Once again, two more than two times five

93
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,710
because we're adding two to itself one more time.

94
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,290
So it's going to be two more.

95
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,880
Let's keep going.

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,540
So two times seven.

97
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,148
Two times seven is equal to--

98
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:24,104
well, I could write two plus two plus two plus two--

99
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:27,230
this is getting tiring-- plus two plus two.

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Is that seven?

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,200
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

102
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,849
And that's the same thing as seven plus seven,

103
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,370
which you may or may not know is equal to fourteen.

104
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,550
You could just say hey, that's going to be two more than twelve.

105
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,630
So twelve plus one plus two is-- twelve plus one is thirteen.

106
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,530
Twelve plus two is fourteen.

107
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,580
All right, let's just keep going.

108
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,740
Two times eight.

109
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,810
I could do all of this business here where I add the twos

110
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,660
or I could say, look, it's just going to be two more than two times seven.

111
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,528
So I could say it's going to be fourteen plus two.

112
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,470
I'm just adding two to that one.

113
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,822
So I could say it's sixteen.

114
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:05,610
Or I could also say that's eight plus eight.

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,800
That's also sixteen.

116
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,174
I could have done all the twos out,

117
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:15,040
but if you like you could do that for your own benefit and learning.

118
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,848
We're almost-- well, we could go forever

119
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,360
because there is no largest number.

120
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,510
I can keep going.

121
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,970
Two times nine times ten times one hundred times one thousand times one million.

122
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,642
But I'm going to stop at twelve

123
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,760
because that tends to be what people need to memorize.

124
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,330
But if you really want to be a "mathelete"

125
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,260
you want to go up to twenty.

126
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,790
But let's go to two times nine.

127
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,810
That's going to be two more than two times eight.

128
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,990
It's going to be eighteen.

129
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,690
Or that's nine plus nine.

130
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,060
Also eighteen.

131
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,930
What's two times ten?

132
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
And ten times tables are interesting.

133
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,550
And we're going to see a pattern there in a second

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,040
when we try to complete an entire times tables.

135
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,640
So two times ten?

136
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,800
Two more than two times nine.

137
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,050
It's twenty.

138
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,050
Or we could also say that's ten plus ten.

139
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,360
Ten plus itself two times.

140
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,060
Now what's interesting about this?

141
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,115
This looks just like a two with a zero added.

142
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:10,690
And you're going to see that with anything times ten,

143
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,295
you just put a zero on the right.

144
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,130
And you can think about why that is.

145
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,410
You can view this as two tens is twenty.

146
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,000
That's what twenty is.

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,540
We're almost done.

148
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,820
Let's do two times eleven.

149
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,920
Two times eleven is going to be two more than this right here.

150
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,830
It's going to be twenty-two.

151
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,530
Another interesting pattern.

152
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,220
I have the number repeated twice-- a two and a two.

153
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,160
Interesting.

154
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,818
Something to watch out for

155
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:38,690
as we look at other multiplication tables.

156
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,140
And then finally--

157
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,129
and it's not finally, we could keep going--

158
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,682
Two times-- that's too dark of a color.

159
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:47,059
Two times twelve.

160
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,540
Two times twelve is going to be two more than two times eleven.

161
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,826
That's twenty-four.

162
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,160
We could have also written that as twelve plus twelve.

163
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,110
Or we could've said two plus two plus two plus two

164
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,840
plus two... twelve times.

165
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,660
It all gets you to twenty-four.

166
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,961
So that's the two times tables

167
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:01,970
and I think you see the pattern.

168
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,755
Every time you multiply it by one higher number

169
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,670
you just add two to that number.

170
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,748
So now that we see that pattern,

171
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:11,950
let's see if we can complete a multiplication table.

172
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,260
So what I want to do, I'm going to write all the numbers.

173
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,485
Let's see.

174
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,361
I hope I have space for this.

175
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:29,430
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

176
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,910
Actually, I'll just do it till nine.

177
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,830
I'll just keep going.

178
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,970
Nine.

179
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,106
Actually I won't have space to do that

180
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,680
because I want you to see the entire table.

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,045
So I'm just going up till nine here,

182
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,590
but I encourage you after this video to complete it on your own.

183
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,880
Maybe if we have time I'll complete it here as well.

184
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,887
So these are the first numbers that I'm going to multiply.

185
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:52,060
And I'm going to multiply it times one, two, three, four,

186
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,650
five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

187
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,183
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to--

188
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,298
So first of all--

189
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,321
Actually I should have written this one under--

190
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,710
well, what's one times one?

191
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,110
So this is the way I'm going to view it.

192
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,730
Whatever is one times one I'm going to write here.

193
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,970
Well that's one.

194
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,510
What's one times two?

195
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,400
That's two.

196
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,730
What's one times three?

197
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,360
That's three.

198
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,866
One times anything is that number,

199
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:21,360
so I can just write four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

200
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,540
One times nine is nine.

201
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
Fair enough.

202
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,300
Now let's do the two times tables.

203
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,570
I'll do that in a blue.

204
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,270
Actually, let me do one in that color

205
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,980
and now in maybe a darker blue I'll do the two times tables.

206
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,250
What's two times one?

207
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,430
That's two.

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,690
It's the same thing as one times two.

209
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,000
Notice, these two numbers are the same thing.

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,700
What's two times two?

211
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,000
That's four.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,610
Two times three is six.

213
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,840
We just did this.

214
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,821
Every time you increment or you multiply by a higher number,

215
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,190
you just add by two.

216
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,840
Two times four is eight.

217
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,110
Same thing as four times two.

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,260
Two times five is ten.

219
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,010
Two times six is twelve.

220
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,660
I'm just adding two every time.

221
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,970
Up here I added one from every step, here I'm adding two.

222
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,830
Two times seven, fourteen.

223
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,813
Two times eight, sixteen.

224
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,970
Two times nine, eighteen.

225
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,789
All right, let's do our three times tables.

226
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,508
I'll do it in yellow.

227
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:21,783
Yellow.

228
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:23,828
Three times one is three.

229
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:25,350
Notice, three times one is three.

230
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,910
One times three is three.

231
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,740
These are the same values.

232
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,158
Three times two is the same thing as two times three.

233
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:37,640
Three times two should be the same thing as two times three.

234
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,680
So it's six.

235
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,485
And that makes sense.

236
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:45,690
Three plus three is six or two plus two plus two is six.

237
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,780
So every time here we're going to increase by three.

238
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,880
You see the pattern.

239
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,000
Three times three is nine.

240
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,852
Three plus three plus three.

241
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:54,725
So we went from three to six to nine.

242
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:57,001
So three times four is going to be twelve.

243
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,850
I'm just adding three every time.

244
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,642
Twelve plus three is fifteen.

245
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,404
Fifteen plus three is eighteen.

246
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,580
Eighteen plus three is twenty-one.

247
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,080
Twenty-one plus three is twenty-four.

248
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,500
Twenty-four plus three is twenty-seven.

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,110
So three times nine is twenty-seven.

250
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,840
Three times eight is twenty-four.

251
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,094
So if you were to say eight plus eight plus eight, it would be twenty-four.

252
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,180
Let's see if I can--

253
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,544
So now I'm going to speed it up a little bit,

254
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:22,830
now that we see the pattern.

255
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,088
And you should do this on your own

256
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:26,970
and you really should memorize everything we're doing.

257
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,495
You should actually go all the way up to twelve in both directions.

258
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,057
So let's see.

259
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:35,330
Four times one is four.

260
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm just going to go up by increments of four.

261
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,080
So four plus four is eight.

262
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,960
Eight plus four is twelve.

263
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,920
Twelve plus four is sixteen.

264
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,450
Sixteen plus four is twenty.

265
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,460
Twenty plus four is twenty-four.

266
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Four times six is twenty-four.

267
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,970
Four times seven, twenty-eight.

268
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,250
I'm just going up by four.

269
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,740
Thirty-two and thirty-six.

270
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,490
All right, five times one.

271
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,670
Five times one is going to be five.

272
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,565
Actually, we know that anything that-- well, I want us to keep changing colors,

273
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,400
so I'll just do it in rows like this.

274
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,570
Five times one is five.

275
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,780
Five times two is ten.

276
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,260
Five times three is fifteen.

277
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,430
I'm just going to increase by five.

278
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,687
Five times tables are very fun as well

279
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:24,120
because every number you're going to add-- if we multiply five times--

280
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,870
well, we'll learn about even and odd in the future.

281
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,241
But every other number in its times tables is going to end with a five,

282
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,240
and then every other one's going to end with a zero.

283
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,790
Because if you add five to fifteen you get twenty.

284
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:41,871
You get twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-five.

285
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,380
Fair enough.

286
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,120
Six times tables, let me do it in green.

287
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,210
Six times one is six.

288
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,080
That's easy.

289
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,800
You add six to that, you get twelve.

290
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,490
You add six to that, you get eighteen.

291
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,250
You add six to that, you get twenty-four.

292
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,220
You add six to that, you get thirty.

293
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Then you go six more, thirty-six, forty-two, forty-eight.

294
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,620
Forty-eight plus six is fifty-four.

295
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,620
So six times nine is fifty-four.

296
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,990
All right, we're almost there.

297
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,610
Seven times one, that's seven.

298
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,520
Seven times one is seven.

299
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,610
Seven times two is fourteen.

300
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,740
Seven times three, twenty-one.

301
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,040
Seven times four, twenty-eight.

302
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,512
Seven times five, what's twenty-eight plus seven?

303
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,130
Let's see, if you add two you get to thirty.

304
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,700
Then you add five, it's thirty-five.

305
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,480
Seven times six, forty-two.

306
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,640
Seven times seven, forty-nine.

307
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,775
Seven times eight--

308
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,830
seven times is going to be seven plus this, so it's fifty-six.

309
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,580
I always used to get confused between seven times eight being fifty-six

310
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,610
and six times nine being fifty-four.

311
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,705
So now that I pointed out to you that I always got confused between those two,

312
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:49,389
it's your job not to be confused by those two.

313
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,610
Seven times eight you could say has the six in it.

314
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,850
Six times nine doesn't have the six in it.

315
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,080
That's the way I think of it.

316
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,580
Anyway, seven times nine.

317
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,320
We're going to add another seven here.

318
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,152
It's going to be sixty-three.

319
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:04,830
I'll do it in the same color.

320
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,350
All right, we're at our eight times tables.

321
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,660
Eight times one is eight.

322
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,520
Eight times two is sixteen.

323
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,090
Twenty-four.

324
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,690
Eight times three is twenty-four.

325
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,300
And if we go to three times eight we should also see the twenty-four.

326
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
Yep, it's there.

327
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,110
These values are the same.

328
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
So we're actually doing things twice.

329
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,848
We're doing it when you do eight times three

330
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:27,470
and we're doing it when we did three times eight.

331
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:31,210
Let's see, eight times four, you're going to add eight to it-- thirty-two.

332
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,480
Forty.

333
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,690
Add another eight, forty-eight.

334
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,270
Notice, eight times six, forty-eight.

335
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,230
Six times eight, forty-eight.

336
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,450
All right, eight times seven.

337
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,860
Well, we already pointed that one out, that was fifty-six.

338
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,200
Eight times eight, sixty-four.

339
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,010
Eight times nine, add eight to this, is seventy-two.

340
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,640
Now we're at the nine times tables.

341
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,260
I'm running out of colors.

342
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,520
Maybe I'll reuse a color or two.

343
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,100
I'll use the blue again.

344
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,280
Nine times one is nine.

345
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,700
Nine times two, eighteen nine times three-- we actually know all of these.

346
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,097
We could look it up in the rest of the table

347
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,290
because nine times three is the same thing as three times nine.

348
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,280
It's twenty-seven.

349
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,500
Add nine to that.

350
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,380
Twenty-seven plus nine is thirty-six.

351
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,520
Thirty-six plus nine is forty-five.

352
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,331
Notice, every time you add nine, you go almost up by ten,

353
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,219
but one less than that.

354
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:29,970
So up by ten would be forty-six, and then one less than that is forty-five.

355
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,647
But anyway, notice, the ones--

356
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:33,880
well, I'll talk more about it in the future.

357
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,510
But we go from a nine, eight, seven, six, five on this digit,

358
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,835
on the second digit.

359
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:42,510
And on this digit here you go one, two, three, four.

360
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,010
So it's an interesting pattern.

361
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,240
Another interesting pattern is the digits will add up to nine.

362
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,270
Three plus six is nine, two plus seven is nine.

363
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,831
We'll talk more about that in the future

364
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,620
and maybe prove that to you.

365
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,340
Nine times six, fifty-four.

366
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,150
That was this one as well.

367
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,720
Nine times seven, sixty-three.

368
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,850
Nine times eight, seventy-two.

369
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,910
Nine times nine is eighty-one.

370
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,030
I don't know if you can see that.

371
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,360
Eighty-one.

372
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,480
There you go.

373
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,080
Now, I could keep going.

374
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,780
Actually, I should keep going.

375
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,525
Well, I realize this video is already pretty long.

376
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,316
I want you to memorize this right now

377
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,200
because this is going to get you pretty far.

378
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,542
In the next video I'm going to do the times tables past nine.

379
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,960
See you soon!

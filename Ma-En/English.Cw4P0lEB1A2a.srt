1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,003
It's a game

2
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,000
That they play

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,006
شتموه لما جهلوه(They insulted him when they didn't know who he was)

4
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:18,000
تبعوه لما عرفوا هداه(They became his followers when they truly knew his way)

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What a shame

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What they say

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,003
شتموه لما جهلوه(They insulted him when they didn't know who he was)

تبعوه لما عرفوا هداه(They became his followers when they truly knew his way)

9
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:32,000
Where are you in my dreams?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,003
You feel so close but so far

11
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:41,000
When All I want is to see

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your face in front of me

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You make me chase around

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Shadows in the moonlight

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Only for the sunrise

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,006
To open my eyes

17
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,006
Makes me jump to my feet

18
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:55,006
Walk around the city streets

19
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:58,000
Hoping that I'll find you

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,006
By my side

21
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,006
Then I feel your sunlight

22
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,006
Beautiful and so bright

23
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:06,000
Feeling I'm in your arms

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,003
For a while

25
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,003
Hours pass like a breeze

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,006
Moving through the palm trees

27
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,006
Hand in hand you and me

28
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:18,000
With your smile

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
شتموه لما جهلوه (They insulted him when they didn't know who he was)

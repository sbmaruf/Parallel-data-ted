1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,990
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,130
We're almost done learning all
the rules or laws of angles

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,420
that we need to start
playing the angle game.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,550
So let's just teach
you a couple of more.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,200
So let's say I have two
parallel lines, and you may not

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,700
know what a parallel line is
and I will explain

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,850
it to you now.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,570
So I have one line like this --
you probably have an intuition

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,330
what a parallel line means.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,140
That's one of my parallel
lines, and let me make the

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,540
green one the other
parallel line.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,910
So parallel lines, and I'm
just drawing part of them.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,320
We assume that they keep on
going forever because these are

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,080
abstract notions -- this light
blue line keeps going and going

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,880
on and on and on off the screen
and same for this green line.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,930
And parallel lines are two
lines in the same plane.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,310
And a plane is just kind of
you can kind of use like a

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,270
flat surface is a plane.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,630
We won't go into
three-dimensional space

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,450
in geometry class.

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,990
But they're on the same plane
and you can view this plane as

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,130
the screen of your computer
right now or the piece of paper

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,610
you're working on that never
intersect each other and

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,960
they're two separate lines.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,620
Obviously if they were drawn
on top of each other then

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,410
they intersect each
other everywhere.

27
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,500
So it's really just two
lines on a plane that never

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,640
intersect each other.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
That's a parallel line.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,210
If you've already learned your
algebra and you're familiar

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,190
with slope, parallel lines are
two lines that have the

32
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,430
same slope, right?

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,160
They kind of increase or
decrease at the same rate.

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,540
But they have different
y intercepts.

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,800
If you don't know what
I'm talking about,

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,510
don't worry about it.

37
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,670
I think you know what a
parallel line means.

38
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,840
You've seen this -- parallel
parking, what's parallel

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,080
parking is when you park a car
right next to another car

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,970
without having the two cars
intersect, because if the cars

41
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,690
did intersect you would have to
call your insurance company.

42
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,710
But anyway, so those
are parallel lines.

43
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,440
The blue and the green
lines are parallel.

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,210
And I will introduce you to
a new complicated geometry

45
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,050
term called a transversal.

46
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,800
All a transversal is is
another line that actually

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,940
intersects those two lines.

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,320
That's a transversal.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,310
Fancy word for something
very simple, transversal.

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,370
Let me write it down just
to write something down.

51
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,745
Transversal.

52
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:18,690
54
00:02:18,69 --> 00:02:23,51
It crosses the other two lines.

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,640
I was thinking of pneumonics
for transversals, but I

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,390
probably was thinking of
things inappropriate.

55
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,710
58
00:02:31,71 --> 00:02:33,81
Going on with the geometry.

56
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,710
So we have a transversal
that intersects the

57
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,660
two parallel lines.

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,910
What we're going to do is think
of a bunch of -- and actually

59
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,060
if it intersects one
of them it's going to

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,320
intersect the other.

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,380
I'll let you think about that.

62
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,940
There's no way that I can draw
something that intersects one

63
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,750
parallel line that doesn't
intersect the other, as long as

64
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,800
this line keeps going forever.

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,790
I think that that might be
pretty obvious to you.

66
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,690
But what I want to do
is explore the angles

67
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,640
of a transversal.

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,180
So the first thing I'm
going to do is explore

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,490
the corresponding angles.

70
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,500
So let's say corresponding
angles are kind of the

71
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,890
same angle at each of
the parallel lines.

72
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,260
corresponding angles.

73
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,890
They kind of play the same
role where the transversal

74
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,830
intersects each of the lines.

75
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,820
As you can imagine, and as it
looks from my amazingly neat

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,390
drawing -- I'm normally not
this good -- that these are

77
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,780
going to be equal
to each other.

78
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,500
So if this is x, this
is also going to be x.

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
If we know that then we could
use, actually the rules that we

80
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,510
just learned to figure out
everything else about

81
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,390
all of these lines.

82
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,740
Because if this is x then what
is this going to be right here?

83
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,260
What is this angle going
to be in magenta?

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,970
90
00:03:58,97 --> 00:04:00,99
Well, these are opposite
angles, right?

85
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,785
They're on opposite
side of crossing lines

86
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:03,810
so this is also x.

87
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,940
94
00:04:06,94 --> 00:04:08,41
And similar we can do
the same thing here.

88
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,030
This is the opposite angle of
this angle, so this is also x.

89
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,580
97
00:04:18,58 --> 00:04:21,01
Let me pick a good color.

90
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,520
What is yellow?

91
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,180
What is this angle going to be?

92
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,310
Well, just like we
were doing before.

93
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,090
Look, we have this huge
angle here, right?

94
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,910
This angle, this whole
angle is 180 degrees.

95
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,860
So x and this yellow angle are
supplementary, so we could call

96
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,260
Well, if this angle is y, then
this angle is opposite to y.

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,100
So this angle is also y.

98
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,560
Fascinating.

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,220
And similarly, if we have x up
here and x is supplementary to

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,920
this angle as well, right?

101
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,600
So this is equal to 180 minus
x where it also equals y.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,330
And then opposite angles,
this is also equal to y.

103
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,170
So there's all sorts of
geometry words and rules that

104
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,170
fall out of this, and I'll
review them real fast but

105
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,090
it's really nothing fancy.

106
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,850
All I did is I started
off with the notion of

107
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,850
corresponding angles.

108
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,320
I said well, this x
is equal to this x.

109
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,350
I said, oh well, if those are
equal to each other, well not

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,810
even if -- I mean if this is x
and this is also x because

111
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,590
they're opposite, and the
same thing for this.

112
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,260
Then, well, if this is x and
this is x and those equal

113
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,750
each other, as they should
because those are also

114
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,750
corresponding angles.

115
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,310
These two magenta angles
are playing the same role.

116
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,270
They're both kind of
the bottom left angle.

117
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,970
That's how I think about it.

118
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,420
We went around, we used
supplementary angles to kind

119
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,820
of derive well, these y
angles are also the same.

120
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,270
This y angle is equal to
this y angle because

121
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,660
it's corresponding.

122
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,800
So corresponding angles
are equal to each other.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,820
It makes sense, they're kind
of playing the same role.

124
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,270
The bottom right, if you look
at the bottom right angle.

125
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,020
So corresponding
angles are equal.

126
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:22,870
139
00:06:22,87 --> 00:06:25,13
That's my shorthand notation.

127
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,360
And we've really just
derived everything already.

128
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,650
That's all you really
have to know.

129
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,040
But if you wanted to kind of
skip a step, you also know

130
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:46,530
the alternate interior
angles are equal.

131
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,320
So what do I mean by
alternate interior angles?

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,980
Well, the interior angles are
kind of the angles that are

133
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,560
closer to each other in the two
parallel lines, but they're on

134
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,410
opposite side of
the transversal.

135
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,850
That's a very complicated way
of saying this orange angle and

136
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,300
this magenta angle right here.

137
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,760
These are alternate interior
angles, and we've already

138
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,630
proved if this is
x then that is x.

139
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,420
So these are alternate
interior angles.

140
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,570
This x and then that x
are alternate interior.

141
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,220
And actually this y and this y
are also alternate interior,

142
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,120
and we already proved that
they equal each other.

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,520
Then the last term that you'll
see in geometry is alternate --

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm not going to write the
whole thing -- alternate

145
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,800
exterior angle.

146
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,760
Alternate exterior
angles are also equal.

147
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,970
That's the angles on the kind
of further away from each other

148
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,270
on the parallel lines, but
they're still alternate.

149
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,790
So an example of that is this x
up here and this x down here,

150
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,540
right, because they're on the
outsides of the two parallel

151
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,680
of the transversal.

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,720
These are just fancy words,
but I think hopefully

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,770
you have the intuition.

154
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,410
Corresponding a angles make
the most sense to me.

155
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,180
Then everything else proves out
just through opposite angles

156
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,450
and supplementary angles.

157
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:18,150
But alternate exterior is
that angle and that angle.

158
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,880
Then the other alternate
exterior is this y and this y.

159
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,870
Those are also equal.

160
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,150
So if you know these, you know
pretty much everything you need

161
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,190
to know about parallel lines.

162
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,300
The last thing I'm going to
teach you in order to play the

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,780
geometry game with full force
is just that the angles in a

164
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,140
triangle add up to 180 degrees.

165
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,770
181
00:08:41,77 --> 00:08:45,58
So let me just draw a
triangle, a kind of

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,580
random looking triangle.

167
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,300
That's my random
looking triangle.

168
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,690
And if this is x, this
is y, and this is z.

169
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,380
We know that the angles of a
triangle -- x degrees plus y

170
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,910
degrees plus z degrees are
equal to 180 degrees.

171
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,580
So if I said that this is
equal to, I don't know, 30

172
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,240
degrees, this is equal to,
I don't know, 70 degrees.

173
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,170
Then what does z equal?

174
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:23,650
Well, we would say 30 plus 70
plus z is equal to 180, or

175
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,740
100 plus z is equal to 180.

176
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,150
Subtract 100 from both sides.

177
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,480
z would be equal to 80 degrees.

178
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,150
We'll see variations of this
where you get two of the angles

179
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,250
and you can use this property
to figure out the third.

180
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,450
With everything we've now
learned, I think we're

181
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,290
ready to kind of ease
into the angle game.

182
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,510
I'll see you in the next video.

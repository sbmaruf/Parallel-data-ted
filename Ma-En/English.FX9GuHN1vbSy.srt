1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,235
Consider the numbers
1/3, 7, and negative 15.

3
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:06,790

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,620
To which sets of
numbers, listed below,

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,890
does each of these
numbers belong?

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,230
And they give us a bunch of
different sets of numbers.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,521
And we could just review these.

8
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:16,990
The natural numbers,
and you'll see

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,870
this used in different
contexts in different places,

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,760
but for the sake of
this video, we'll

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,020
assume this is counting numbers,
and it does not equal 0.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,345
So the natural numbers are 1,
2, 3, 4, and so on and so forth.

13
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,470
We'll assume that the whole
numbers are essentially

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,340
the natural numbers plus 0.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,700
So the whole numbers are 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, so on and so forth.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,610
The integers we'll assume
it's the whole numbers

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,010
plus the opposite of
the natural numbers,

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,340
or the negative version
of the natural numbers.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,630
So we would go from
very negative values

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,700
to maybe negative 4,
negative 3, negative 2,

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,410
negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, so on and so forth.

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,890
Rational numbers.

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,060
These are numbers
that can be expressed

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,900
as the ratio of two integers.

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,680
So a rational number
can be expressed as m

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,380
over n, where both m
and n are integers.

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,535
And of course n cannot be 0,
because anything divided by 0

28
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,170
is not defined.

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,740
M could be 0, and in fact,
0 is a rational number,

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,750
because 0 can be
represented as 0 over 1.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,220
Or really 0 over 2, or 0 over 3.

32
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,450
I think you get the idea.

33
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,350
Or 0 over negative 537.

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,459
These are all
representations of 0,

35
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,500
and you have an integer
in the numerator, integer

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,520
in the denominator.

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,340
So 0 is definitely
a rational number.

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,830
You just can't have n, you can't
have the denominator, be 0.

39
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,750
Irrational numbers are numbers
that cannot be expressed

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,830
in this way.

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,610
And so common versions
of irrational numbers

42
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,690
are numbers that you will never
see digits that repeat on, go

43
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,550
on and on forever, or have
series of sequences of numbers

44
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,570
that keep repeating
on and on and on.

45
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,520
And examples of irrational
numbers are square root of 2,

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,400
or pi.

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,865
And the ratio of the
circumference, the diameter

48
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:17,600
of a circle, or you might learn
about the irrational number

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
e, which is 2.71.

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,580
And it keeps going,
and it doesn't repeat.

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,420
And then real numbers are
really all of these combined.

52
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,080
If you combine the
irrational numbers

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,730
and the rational
numbers, then you

54
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,520
are talking about
the real numbers.

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,310
Every real number is either
rational or irrational.

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,770
So let's classify
what we have up here.

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:48,250
1/3 over here-- let me do that
in a different color-- so 1/3,

58
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,520
is it a natural number?

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,314
Well no, it's not.

60
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,980
It's not just a natural
counting number.

61
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,880
Is it a whole number?

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,620
No, it's not a whole number,
it's in fact a fraction.

63
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,550
Is it an integer?

64
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,450
No once again, it
is not an integer.

65
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,310
Is it a rational number?

66
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,110
Well sure it is.

67
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,720
It can be represented
as 1 over 3.

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,020
Both 1 and 3 are integers.

69
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,050
So 1/3 is rational.

70
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,950

71
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,260
And if something is rational,
it cannot be irrational.

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,000
There's nothing that's both
rational and irrational.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,750
This literally
means not rational.

74
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,155
And it is also a real number.

75
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:24,670

76
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,210
Pretty much all of these are
going to be real numbers.

77
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,280
Now, let's try 7 out.

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,830

79
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,360
So the number 7, it
is a natural number.

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,480
It is just a regular
counting number.

81
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,500
It is a whole number.

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,930
Any natural number is also
going to be a whole number.

84
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,920
And anything that is a
natural number that's

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,544
also going to be a whole number
is also going to be an integer.

86
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,350
So this is also an integer.

87
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,600
And anything that is a natural
number, a whole number,

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,325
and integer, is also going
to be a rational number.

89
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:59,220

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,540
And to see that, you
can write 7 as 7 over 1.

91
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,970
In fact, you can
write any integer

92
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,010
as that number over 1, which
hopefully makes it obvious

93
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,320
that that is also
a rational number.

94
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,450
And if it's rational,
you can't be irrational.

95
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,180
That literally
means not rational.

96
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,490
And then of course,
you're going to be real.

97
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,890
It's going to be a real number.

98
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,390
And you're going
to appreciate later

99
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,194
on in your mathematical
careers why we even

100
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,360
go through the trouble of
saying it's a real number.

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,180
Because as far as
it seems right now,

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,161
this kind of includes
all the numbers.

103
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,910
What you're going to
see in the future is,

104
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,660
we're going to start
defining numbers that

105
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,940
don't fall into this category.

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,850
And they're a little bit
philosophically interesting

107
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,530
as well.

108
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,350
But anyway, back to the problem.

109
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,580
We have a negative 15.

110
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,842
Negative 15 is not a natural
number, it's a negative number.

111
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:47,675
So it's not a natural
number, natural number

112
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:50,857
is only the positive
integers, we could say.

113
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,440
Whole number, it's
not a whole number,

114
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,400
because that's just the
natural numbers and 0.

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,240
It is an integer.

116
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,030
It is the opposite
of positive 15.

117
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,360
It is an integer.

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,240
It is rational, it can be
represented as 15 over 1.

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,710
So it is a rational.

120
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,570
And because it is rational,
it cannot be rational.

121
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,280
And of course, it is also real.

122
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,430
And we are done.

1
00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:04,653
In the beginning the web was simple, connected

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,846
open, safe

3
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:09,333
designed as a force for good

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,025
it would become something far greater

5
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,882
a living, breathing ecosystem

6
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:15,675
in service of humanity

7
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,762
a public resource for innovation

8
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:19,331
and opportunity.

9
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:21,674
A place to build your dreams.

10
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:23,379
But in those early days,

11
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,060
like any ecosystem,

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,060
the web needed nurturing.

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,511
As it grew, users faced new challenges.

14
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:32,403
Popups. Viruses.

15
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:34,549
A lack of choice.

16
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:37,171
Walled gardens of content.

17
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,646
The web was fraying.

18
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:42,506
it was slow, complicated, scary.

19
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:44,311
Users began to ask...

20
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,013
is this it?

21
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,948
or could the web be something better?

22
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,168
A small group of people

23
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:52,603
coders, designers, idealists

24
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:54,655
believed it could.

25
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,379
They had an audacious idea.

26
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,058
That a tiny non-profit and a global community

27
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,230
could build something better

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,070
and force new ideas and innovation on to the Web.

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,297
They called it the Mozilla project.

30
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:11,487
They began by making a new kind of Web browser.

31
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,135
What we know today as Firefox.

32
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:15,417
And they made it a non-profit,

33
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:20,044
so it would always put the people who use the web first.

34
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:22,274
more than software, it was a platform that

35
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:26,143
anyone could use to build on their ideas.

36
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:27,664
The nuisances diminished.

37
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:30,125
The foundations of the Web we know today

38
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,762
began to appear

39
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,552
Now the Web is a place where you can build almost

40
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,157
anything you can imagine

41
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:38,677
Mozilla and Firefox

42
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:42,261
exist to help people everywhere seize this opportunity

43
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:46,085
and to stand up for users in a world where choice and control

44
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,484
are too often at risk.

45
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,256
But what if Firefox was just the beginning?

46
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:55,681
What if it was part of something bigger?

47
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,070
From user privacy to Firefox Mobile,

48
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,330
to apps and identity,

49
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,289
we're pushing the boundaries of the web every day.

50
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,717
And we are going beyond software.

51
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:09,513
We're helping to build a generation of web makers.

52
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:12,189
we believe the web is a place where anyone

53
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,648
can come to build their dreams.

54
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,866
It's why we make Firefox.

55
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:20,781
It's why tens of thousands of volunteers help build our products.

56
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,607
It's why hundreds of millions around the world use our software

57
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:28,393
But most importantly -- it's why we always put you first,

58
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:31,389
and stand up to those who don't.

59
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,064
millions know us for Mozilla Firefox.

60
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,689
But we are about so much more.

61
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,988
We are a non-profit

62
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:41,812
fighting to protect the web we all love.

63
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:44,936

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,525
The height of a triangle is 4 inches less than the length of the base.

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:11,355
The area of the triangle is 30 in^2. Find the height and base.

3
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:17,601
Use the formula A=1/2 base times height for the area of a triangle.

4
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:26,680
Ok. So let's think about it a little bit. Let me draw a triangle here.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,511
So this is our triangle and let's say the length of this bottom side, that's the base, lets call that 'b'.

6
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,760
And then this is the height, this is the height, right over here.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,267
And then the area is equal to one-half base times height. A = 1/2 b h .

8
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:50,085
Now this first sentence is telling us that height of a triangle is 4 inches less than the length of the base.

9
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:56,200
So the height is equal to the base minus 4. That's what the first sentence tells us.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:17,667
The area of the triangle is 30 inches^2. So if we take one-half the base times height we will get 30 inches^2. Or we can say that 30 inches^2 is equal to one-half times the base times the height.

11
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:23,200
Now instead of putting that 'h' in for height we know that the height is the same thing as 4 less than

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,751
the base. So let's just put that in there.

13
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:28,840
And then let's see what we get in here.

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,867
I'll put this in yellow. We get 30 equals one half b/2 times b-4

15
00:01:36,867 --> 00:02:06,067
Now let's distribute the b, so 30 is equal to b squared over 2- be careful. b/2 times b is just b squared over 2- and then b/2 times -4 is -2b

16
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:10,566
now just to get rid of this fraction here, let's multiply both sides of the equation by two

17
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:18,333
So let's multiply that side by 2 and that side by two. On the left hand side you get 60

18
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:25,267
on the right hand side, 2 times b^2/2 equals b squared, -2b times 2 is -4b

19
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:34,000
And now we have a quadratic here, and the best way to solve a quadratic is to get all of the terms on

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,733
one side of the equation and have them equal 0. So let's subtract 60 from both sides of the equation.

21
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:54,133
And we get 0 is equal to b squared minus 4 b minus 60. So what we need to do is factor this thing right

22
00:02:54,133 --> 00:03:00,800
now, and then know that if we have the product of some things and that equals zero, that means that either

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,546
one or both of those thing need to be equal to zero, so we need factor b squared minus 4b minus 60. So

24
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:29,333
what we want to find 2 numbers whose sum is -4 and whose product is -60. Now given that the product is

25
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:37,667
negative, we know that they will have different signs. And this tells us that their absolute value will

26
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:46,333
be four apart. So let's look at the factors of 60: 1 and 60 are too far apart. If you made one of them

27
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:55,467
negative, you would get positive 59 or negative 59 as a sum. 2 and 30, still to far apart. 3 and 20,

28
00:03:55,467 --> 00:04:04,645
still to far apart. If you made one of them negative, you would either get negative 17 or positive 17.

29
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:10,311
Then you could have 4 and 15- still to far apart. If you made one of them negative, you would either

30
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:20,133
get -11 or positive 11. Then you have 5 and 12- still too far apart, you could either have positive 7

31
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:31,467
or negative 7. Now you have 6 and 10: now this looks interesting. They are 4 apart, and we want the larger

32
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:37,667
number to be negative so that their sum is negative. So if we make it 6 and negative 10, their sum will

33
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:48,667
be negative 4, and their product is -60. So that works. So you can say that this is equal to b+6 times

34
00:04:48,667 --> 00:05:06,133
b-10. Let me be careful. This b over here is different than the b that we are using in the equation. I

35
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:12,733
just used this b to say look, we are looking for 2 numbers that add up to this second term. It's a different

36
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:28,533
'b.' I could have used x and y. In fact let me do it that way. now x plus y = -4, and x times y is -60.

37
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:46,558
so we have b + x times b + y. x is six and y is negative 10. You could also solve this by grouping. We

38
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:59,400
know that either b + 6 is equal to zero, or b - 10 = 0. If we subtract 6 from both side of the equation

39
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,293
you get b = -6, and if you subtract be from both sides of this equation you get b = 10. The other way

40
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:26,473
to solve this is break up this -4b into its consitutents. So you could have broken this up into 0 = b

41
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:39,000
squared, and you could have broken if up into +6b -10b, and then factor is by grouping. Group these first

42
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,200
two terms, group these second two terms. Just add them together. the first one you can factor out a b

43
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:55,533
to you have b times b + 6, the second one you have factor out a negative 10, to -10 times b + 6 all of

44
00:06:55,533 --> 00:07:11,133
that is equal to zero, now factor out a b + 6. Then you get 0 = b-10 times b+6. We are just factoring

45
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:29,800
out this out of the expression. Either way, the solutions are b = -6 or b = 10. remember, this is a word

46
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:39,267
problem. We have to think about whether this makes sense in the context of the actual problem. We are

47
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:54,667
talking about lengths of triangles, we cannot have a negative length. So we can cross out -6 and we

48
00:07:54,667 --> 00:08:08,803
are left with 1 solution. The only possible base is 10. They say "find the height and the base." So the

49
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:15,885
base is 10 and the height is 4 inches less, so the height is 6. And then you can verify. The area is

50
00:08:15,885 --> 99:59:59,000
6 times 10 times 1/2, which is 30.

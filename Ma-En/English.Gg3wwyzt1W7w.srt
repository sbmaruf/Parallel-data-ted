1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,500
Round 423,275 to the
nearest thousand.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,360
So let me rewrite it: 423,275.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,080
And so the thousands place is
the 3 right here, and so if we

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,920
were round it up to the nearest
thousand, we would go

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,990
to 420-- let me write it so we
just focus on the 3-- we would

6
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:39,160
go up to 424,000 if we wanted
to round up, 424,000, and if

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:46,950
we wanted to round down,
we would go to 423,000.

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,990
We would get rid of the 275.

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,010
423,000.

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,510
So this is our choice.

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,140
Round up to 424,000 or round
down to 423,000.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,560
And to figure it out, we just
look at the digit one place to

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,070
the right of the 3, so we look
at the 2 right there.

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,350
If that digit is 5 or greater,
you round up.

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,100
So this is 5.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,220
So if this is greater than
or equal to 5, 5 or

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,880
greater, you round up.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,550
If it's less than 5,
you round down.

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,460
2 is definitely less than 5, so
we just round down, so it

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,600
is 423,000.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,260
Now just to visualize what
this means to the nearest

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,380
thousand, if I were to do a
number line-- and you don't

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:36,930
have to do this.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,470
We've gotten the answer, but
just to have a little bit

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,390
better visualization of it,
if I were to increment by

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:52,360
thousands, you might have
422,000, 423,000.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,940
You have 424,000, and then
maybe over here, you have

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,690
425,000, and you could
keep going.

29
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,820
Now 423,275 is going to be
someplace right around here.

30
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,730
And so when we round to the
nearest thousand, we have to

31
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,120
pick between that and that.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,480
We see that it much closer to
423,000 than to 424,000, so we

33
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,500
round it right there.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,220
But you just use the rules we
just came up with, and we

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,220
rounded down to 423,000.

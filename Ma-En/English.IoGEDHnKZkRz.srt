1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:08,850
What is the place value
of 3 in 654.213?

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,200
So let's think about
that a little bit.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,110
And to do that, let me rewrite
the number, and I'll write

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,620
each digit in a different
color.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:31,760
So we have 654 point-- we get
the decimal point-- 213.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,610
Now we're pretty familiar, I
think, with what goes on to

7
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,920
the left of the decimal point.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,670
We know that this right here--
let me do this in a neutral

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,590
color-- is the hundreds place,
or we could view that as 10 to

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,730
the second.

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,620
Let me write that a little
bit bigger down here.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,590
So this right here that is the
hundreds place, or you could

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,800
view that as the 10 to the
second's place, which is the

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,350
same thing as hundred.

15
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,100
This right here is the tens
place, which is the same thing

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,030
as 10 to the first. This right
here is the ones place, which

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,190
is the same thing as
10 to the zero.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,440
Then if you go one place to
the right of the decimal

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,200
point, this represents tenths.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,910
This represents tenths, or we
could view it as 10 to the

21
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,170
negative one.

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,220
Then, if we go to this magenta,
if we go two places

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,670
to the right, this represents
hundredths, or 10 to the

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,500
negative two.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,060
And then finally, this 3
represents thousandths.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,870
This represents thousandths, or
10 to the negative three.

27
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,780
Now, just to answer the question
what is the place

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,970
value of 3 in 654.213?

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,520
The place value is
thousandths.

30
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,010
That would essentially answer
their question.

31
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,650
But to make sure that we really
understand what this

32
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,810
means, I'm going to rewrite
this number.

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,840
We can rewrite this
number as 600.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,800
We have 6 hundreds plus 5 tens,
or you could say plus 50

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:48,630
plus 4 ones plus 2/10, plus
1/100, plus 3/1,000.

36
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,380
Or we could write this, just
to really make sure we

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,960
understand what we're talking
about when we mean place

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:02,170
value, we can rewrite this
number as 6 times 100, plus 5

39
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:10,020
times 10, plus 4 times 1-- I
keep doing that in the wrong

40
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:28,190
color-- plus 2 times 1/10, plus
1 times 1/100, and then

41
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,940
finally, plus 3 times 1/1,000.

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,540
So hopefully, when you write it
out like this, it gives you

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,630
a sense of what it means
we say place value.

44
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,350
The 6, three digits to the left
of the decimal, is in the

45
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,110
hundreds place, so it represents
6 hundreds.

46
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,190
This represents 5 tens because
it's in the tens place.

47
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,820
This represents 4 ones.

48
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,640
You go to the thousandths
place, this 3 literally

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,686
represents three
one-thousandths.

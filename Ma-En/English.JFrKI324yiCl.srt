Episode 12

3
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:13,833
You are leaving already?

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,233
It's late so just sleep over.

5
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,533
No, thanks.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:23,333
I have some books to look over, so I'll just go.

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,267
Hey...

8
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:31,000
You should stop, and move back in now.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,767
I know you are living on your own to find your goal in life,

10
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:43,133
but what about my dream of living happily together, all of us, and living a bustling life?

11
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:47,033
Your being like this is making it hard on Ha Ni as well.

12
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:53,002
From her perspective she may be thinking that she is the reason why you won't come home,

13
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:57,267
so be a little more nurturing and caring of her.

14
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:01,006
Please allow me to make my own decisions regarding my life.

15
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:04,007
I do not want to be manipulated.

16
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,333
Seung Jo...

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,567
I did not want to stay in this house, that's why I left.

18
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:14,006
You brought Ha Ni back in without even asking, or considering my feelings on the matter.

19
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,767
Because of that, do whatever you want Mother.

20
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:17,009
Baek Seung Jo...

21
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:34,003
I am sorry.I am leaving now.

22
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:38,067
Dear, understand him...

23
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:42,933
It's not like I said anything about him not coming back.

24
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:48,005
He left in search of his dream and to change himself in the process.

25
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:54,033
But in the end, nothing has changed. We do not ever see him around.

26
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,005
He is still as cold as ever towards Ha Ni.

27
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:02,004
Dear, how about you sit down and have another talk with him?

28
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:05,001
He will at least listen to his father

29
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:08,899
Even if I talk, does that mean he'll even listen?

30
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,001
Let's just wait, and see what kind of decision he makes.

31
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:20,633
But, besides that, has he been eating well on his own?

32
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:25,367
Judging by what I am seeing it seems his face has sunken in.

33
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,533
Let's wait a bit.

34
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:31,009
At least, he makes his own decision. He should be fine.

35
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,933
You think so?

36
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,367
Enjoy the meal!

37
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:41,233
We will eat well!

38
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,367
Ah! It's hot.

39
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,009
What's wrong with your hand?

40
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,005
Housewife's eczema.

41
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:53,067
This is what happens when you wash the hair of 50 people a day.Oh my gosh...

42
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:58,006
Oh man does not it hurt?Yeah it hurts it itches, hurts, and is driving me insane!

43
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:04,433
But it's better than sitting in class studying boring material!

44
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,009
I am still happy!

45
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,833
Min Ah how is the web comic you are working on?

46
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:18,008
Well I am drawing characters, and working at a part time job now.

47
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:25,033
But, what about you guys always being busy and leaving me alone!

48
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:28,362
I really can not this time.

49
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:32,233
After messing up, I always end up writing reports.

50
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,567
Aigoo, you should try a little harder.

51
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,433
How is it?

52
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,233
Is it good?

53
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,067
Yes.Yes, it's really good.

54
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:39,567
Really?

55
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,033
But, what kind of noodles are these?

56
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:46,007
Nutrient filled noodles for you youngsters busy working and studying.

57
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:51,535
It's is especially made for you girls by So Pal Bok Noodles, and it's called Sam Gye Chi Jak Chopped Noodles.

58
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:56,667
It's a delicacy mixed with the world's best samgyetang and chopped noodles.

59
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:00,009
Sir, can I have one more bowl please?

60
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,613
But dad...

61
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:02,263
Huh?

62
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,567
I do not see Joon Gu.

63
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:07,233
That kid has recently fallen in love with the art of cooking.

64
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,004
He's gone to the market to go personally pick and choose his own ingredients.

65
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:14,000
Is that really our Bong Joon Gu?

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,133
That's really different from back when he was in High School

67
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,932
Did you guys hear?

68
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:20,733
About what?

69
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,004
Our high school reunion thing?

70
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,004
Reunion?

71
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:28,367
They have a dress code with a theme of school look.

72
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,167
I heard it too.

73
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:34,007
I heard. But I am in trouble, because all my uniforms have gotten smaller because I've gained weight.

74
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:39,006
I do not know whose idea it is, but I love it.

75
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,009
Our memorable uniforms...

76
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,267
Seung Jo looked good in his uniform.

77
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,000
Especially the winter uniforms.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:05,967
Baek Seung Jo again?

79
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,002
You heard about it?

80
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,008
What?

81
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:15,133
That there's a high school reunion, and the dress code is our old uniforms. Isn't that a fun idea?

82
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:18,068
Who gave such a childish idea?

83
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,001
I heard it and I do not have any interest in it.

84
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,467
Still,

85
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:27,007
I am already excited about meeting my old school mates.

86
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:30,005
Are not you curious about how they are doing?

87
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:34,033
If you are interested then go.

88
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,000
Really that brat...

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:49,733
I just can not figure out what he is thinking.

90
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,833
Seung Jo said he would not go?

91
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,006
Yes...

92
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,267
Yes, he said it was childish.

93
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,833
Why is he like that?

94
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,005
I totally miss those youthful days.

95
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:06,132
I had a blind date at a dduk bok gi stand in front of the school.

96
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:14,644
Omo! The Ddukbokki in that restaurant is really good! Many school kids go there.

97
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,011
What was I talking about?

98
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,777
Blind dating!

99
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,881
Aah blind dating!

100
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:25,244
It was blind dating! Until I ate the whole plate, that male student could not bring himself to say a word.

101
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:27,911
So I told him to have some.

102
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:33,928
He was like "Yes!" and started gulping down all the water.

103
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,048
You were only in high school?!

104
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,023
Yes.

105
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:41,677
Yes, I am talking about your dad! Student Baek Soo Chang!

106
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:44,177
Back then he was so cute!

107
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:50,944
For me, I can not forget how Seung Jo looked at graduation night when he did his speech!

108
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,611
I am going to have fun and I am going to be happy.

109
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,319
I am going to live like that.

110
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,183
Everybody, where ever you going to be, live having fun.

111
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:09,144
Omo, Ha Ni! I have thought of a good idea that would make Seung Jo want to attend the high school reunion.

112
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:13,411
Really?

113
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:16,077
What is that smell?

114
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:19,477
Oh my!

115
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:52,577
What to do?!

116
00:07:52,577 --> 00:08:23,244
Mhm! What is it? Ahh.. heh

117
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:27,044
<I>The thing that allowed me to meet Seung Jo in my dream

118
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:54,977
<i>was the leaf.

119
00:08:54,977 --> 00:09:02,068
But still, he did not give me an F mark.

120
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:05,211
Parang High School's 14th Graduating Class Reunion

121
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,311
You have become much prettier.

122
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:21,411
Where are you going?

123
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:25,711
<i>Did Seung Jo come?

124
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:31,077
Ha Ni!

125
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:32,577
Why are you so late?

126
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:35,311
Yeah! You do not even answer your cell phone!

127
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,777
My mother told me to leave my cell phone at home.

128
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,509
Hand phone?Why?

129
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:43,379
I do not know. I think she has something planned.

130
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:48,031
But, it's strange coming here wearing our school uniforms. Yeah?

131
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,011
Why? Is not it thrillng and fun as if we are ditching, which we never got to do in high school?

132
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,025
You never ditched?

133
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,311
I said I never was able to do it wearing my uniform.

134
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,211
Hmm...

135
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,344
Hey, what about Joon Gu?

136
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:05,111
Ah, there was a group reservation at the restaurant, so he could not come.

137
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,877
Oooo he is a real chef now?

138
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:11,077
Seriously.

139
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:15,744
But... Seung Jo... did not come?

140
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:20,311
Aigoo! If you are here to see Seung Jo, then why did not you search for him already?

141
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,844
He is already here. Over there.

142
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:25,877
He looks completely uncomfortable.

143
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:30,944
Oh! He is here! Then I am only going to greet him for a bit.

144
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:40,477
Only greet him?

145
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:43,377
You said you would not come, but you did.

146
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,177
Why did you leave home without your cell phone?

147
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,511
Huh?

148
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:55,044
That...

149
00:10:55,044 --> 00:11:00,244
Mother had to quickly leave for Busan to meet her family and you left your keys at home.

150
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,111
She told me to give them to you, so I came.

151
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,479
Is that so?

152
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:07,744
I did not...

153
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:12,377
Ah.. sorry. Looks like you went out of your way because of me.

154
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:21,177
Thank you. Without you I would nothave been able to enter the house tonight.

155
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:26,211
Well since you are here, spend some time with friends.

156
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:29,639
No need.

157
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,904
Baek Seung Jo where you going?

158
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:34,662
Sit down, Sit down.It's been really a long time.

159
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:36,062
Long time no see, how have you been?

160
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,879
You are the same as always.

161
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,462
You are making a statement that the school look is childish right?

162
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,737
That's just like you Baek Seung Jo.

163
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,059
Is not that Baek Seung Jo?

164
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:46,988
Have you been well?Yes

165
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:51,897
Punk, it would've been great if we went to Tae San University together. We could have enjoyed college life together.

166
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:55,144
I hear you are still being called the prodigy even at Parang University.

167
00:11:55,144 --> 00:12:01,899
Do you know how regretful the head of administration is for losing you?

168
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,599
That's Oh Han Ni right?

169
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,443
Has she become your girlfriend?

170
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,947
Wow Oh Ha Ni, I guess personality does win it.

171
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:13,838
She's been following you around so long, and eventually even got into Parang University and made it happen!

172
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:18,619
Seung Jo is the amazing one. It probably wasn't easy accepting her as a girlfriend.

173
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:22,584
Girlfriends? How bothersome. I don't do that kind of crap.

174
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:26,982
Then again, I guess a girlfriend doesn't really fit with the almighty Baek Seung Jo.

175
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:31,626
I see, so Class 7's Oh Ha Ni.

176
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,473
But Baek Seung Jo, what's your major?

177
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:36,892
There's no such thing. I'm undecided.

178
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,792
You mean you still haven't decided on a major?

179
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,878
Not yet.

180
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:43,045
You can inherit your father's company.

181
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:48,216
Isn't the Chairman's position just waiting for you?

182
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,657
Parang High's best band!

183
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:53,313
Taking over the Hong Dae indie band scene...

184
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:59,347
Annyong Bada!

185
00:12:59,347 --> 00:14:04,313
<i>Brought to you by PKer team @ www.viikii.net

186
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:10,647
It must have been fun seeing his friends after such a long time,<i>but he left without a word.

187
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:50,513
Is he sick?

188
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,813
Seung Jo , I...

189
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:57,347
I would like it if you would take over my gaming company.

190
00:14:57,347 --> 00:15:03,847
At first as my reliable right-hand man, and later onI would like it if you could take the company in a new direction with your own abilities.

191
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,866
If you wanted, you could easily become a doctor.

192
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,847
So kids like Nu Ri...

193
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:18,028
I think it would be nice if you became a doctor that fixed the illnesses for many people all around the world.

194
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:22,946
You forgot this.

195
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:25,025
Thanks.

196
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,947
May I have a seat?

197
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:28,613
As you wish.

198
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:35,313
Thank you.

199
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:39,028
Are you worried about something?

200
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:40,513
Tell me.

201
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:49,018
Don't they say sharing worries could halve them and sharing your happiness will double it?

202
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:53,547
I will help you.

203
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:59,547
When I'm worrying about something, or if something good happens, I let Min Ah and Ju Ri know.

204
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:02,113
Once I do that, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

205
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:19,058
Then again, sometimes I tell them too much and that becomes a problem.

206
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,847
I'm going to go into the medical field.

207
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,447
I'm going to apply to the med program.

208
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:28,006
Though I don't know whether or not it's a good match for me,

209
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:32,126
for the first time I've found something I'm interested in.

210
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:36,002
Seung Jo ah..

211
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,517
Don't tell anyone about it yet.

212
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:41,299
Especially my parents.

213
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,489
Don't go around spreading rumors all over the place either.

214
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:46,268
Do you understand?

215
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,244
Of course...

216
00:16:48,244 --> 00:17:08,931
Why would I spread rumors?

217
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,048
Omo!

218
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:20,073
Then am I the only one who knows that?!

219
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,094
Well, members of the tennis club,

220
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:27,741
I have some really good news to tell you.

221
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:34,182
Next week is the 10th year anniversary of our Top Spin tennis club!

222
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:41,513
So we're thinking of bringing together all the past and current members to host a really great big party.

223
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:44,088
What do you think? Aren't you excited!?

224
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:47,635
Next week is a holiday, so do you think Hae Ra will come?

225
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,847
I got it cheaply because of the holidays.

226
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:52,413
On top of that, a party with past and current members?

227
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,305
I don't even think I want to go.

228
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:55,073
Really?

229
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:57,898
Then should I take that part out?

230
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:01,713
I think if you could just get Seung Jo to come somehow,

231
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,625
Hae Ra will just come automatically.

232
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,513
That's right! This is why you have the right to be the captain!

233
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:10,047
Seung Jo...Hae Ra... That's right!

234
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:15,078
Then I need to go ask for Ha Ni's advice.

235
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:20,048
<i>So this is the medical department that Seung Jo is trying to get into.

236
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:22,681
<i>I hear it's totally busy here.

237
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:30,058
<i>Doesn't that mean it'll be even harder to see Seung Jo?

238
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,008
Ha Ni! I've been looking for you everywhere.

239
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:36,028
Sunbae! Sunbae, what are you doing here?

240
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:38,038
What about you?

241
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,613
At the medical department... I mean I came looking for you.

242
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:44,008
I'm here because of Seung Jo...

243
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,147
Seung Jo? What about him?

244
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:53,647
Anyway, why did you come all this way searching for me?

245
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:58,018
It's nothing big, but next week is our Top Spin's 10th year anniversary.

246
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:01,513
So I'm planning a party.

247
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,765
Planning a party? So why are you telling me...

248
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:06,647
Listen!

249
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:11,088
For this party, if Seung Jo doesn't show up it becomes a real problem.

250
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:16,213
Senior, don't tell me you're trying to use Seung Jo again to get to Hae Ra.

251
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:19,032
You're not trying to use my Seung Jo as bait are you?!

252
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,147
Stop using that method now!

253
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:26,048
If you're not careful things might just turn for you.

254
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,018
I think you meant turn against you.

255
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,247
Anyways,

256
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:34,047
forcing Seung Jo and Hae Ra together does us absolutely no good.

257
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,018
I know...

258
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:40,068
I know, I know, but if not for this method I will miss the chance to confess to Hae Ra.

259
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:43,813
I need Seung Jo, so Han Ni, why don't you...

260
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:46,313
It's Seung jo!

261
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:47,747
It's Seung Jo.

262
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,713
Ha Ni! This is my last favor. I'm counting on you.

263
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:55,547
Do you understand? I'm counting on you.

264
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,247
Were you following me?

265
00:19:57,247 --> 00:20:15,078
No.

266
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:18,513
I really wanted to visit the medical department at least once.

267
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:21,048
I mean it may be the place you start attending.

268
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:26,068
But it's amazing here. I guess all the people here are going to become doctors in the future.

269
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,713
There are some that don't.

270
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:32,113
But why did you come here?

271
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,513
It's not time to choose your major yet.

272
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:35,913
I came to meet a professor.

273
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:38,013
Why? To talk about what?

274
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:39,068
What would you know even if I told you?

275
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:42,313
Omo, don't look down on me.

276
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:49,098
Oh yeah, today Dad and Ahjushi went to get a check-up at the hospital.

277
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:52,447
I don't know how things turned out.

278
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,147
Want to go stop by the house with me later on?

279
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:57,018
What presents will those two bring back this time?

280
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:59,947
What do you mean present?

281
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:02,008
Cake?..

282
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:03,028
Today is your birthday?

283
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:12,053
Idiot, I mean an illness.

284
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,073
I want coffee.

285
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:21,013
Not for you.

286
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,763
I'm absolutely sick and tired of hospitals now.

287
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:29,115
So how was it? What about the results?

288
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,663
Here it is.

289
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,318
Show me.

290
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:37,783
Health Examination Results

291
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:40,809
I can barely understand it.

292
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,997
Induced...

293
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:46,087
Blood sugar...

294
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,897
It's a cardiac stress test.

295
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:52,163
It's to check for cardiac infarction or angina.

296
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:57,101
Let me have a look.

297
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,563
Your blood pressure is high.

298
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:01,164
Your heart rate is high too.

299
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:04,672
You've got a bit of cardiac stress.

300
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:08,001
Your cholesterol is high too.

301
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,763
Father,

302
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:13,074
you have to watch out for your heart.

303
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:16,368
I heard the exact same thing from the doctor.

304
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,315
Honey, you should be healthy.

305
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:23,309
You need to think of your family.

306
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,053
Hey, Seung Jo.

307
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:29,548
How are you so good at it? It's filled with cryptic words!

308
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,581
Though you're my son, you really amaze me.

309
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:37,101
Hyung could become a doctor too, since he's a genius.

310
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,702
Baek Eun Jo.

311
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:43,092
Being a genius isn't the only good thing to be.

312
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:49,781
Honey from now on you're banned from all things sweet and oily things.

313
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:57,078
Then what do I eat?

314
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:57,535
Dad!

315
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:59,068
You came.

316
00:22:59,068 --> 00:22:59,903
Did something happen?

317
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:01,025
Yes?

318
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:06,312
He used to come running out screaming "Ha Ni" whenever you came.

319
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:08,541
But he's pretty uncaring lately.

320
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,461
Joon Gu?

321
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:11,785
Why? What is he doing?

322
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,039
Hey.

323
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,789
Over there.

324
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,382
Take a look into the kitchen.

325
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:20,028
Today was the first time Joon Gu made a dish presented to a customer.

326
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:20,964
What?

327
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:22,443
Already?

328
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,067
Then does that mean Joon Gu is going to become a chef?

329
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:25,091
Well,

330
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:29,509
he needs a bit more work with the foods presented to the customers.

331
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,917
That's right.

332
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:38,859
He may look that way, but his cooking abilities aren't bad at all. And he tries really hard too.

333
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:39,617
Hey.

334
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:51,593
Let's watch him

335
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:53,597
Joon Gu..

336
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:56,353
I just thought he was messing around everyday.

337
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,093
But I need to look again.

338
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,163
True.

339
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:02,397
See how hard working he is.

340
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:07,018
It's a bit early but he should do alright. But he's actually quite good.

341
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:11,212
He wanted to show you first.

342
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:15,858
Isn't he commendable?

343
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:20,052
<i>It's my first time to see him like that.

344
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:26,834
<i> He doesn't even know that I've come in.

345
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,067
Here.

346
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,863
It looks delicious.

347
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:34,346
Ha Ni, here.

348
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:36,003
Eat well.

349
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:36,963
Yeah.

350
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:50,818
I will eat well.

351
00:24:50,818 --> 00:24:53,937
How is it?

352
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:55,337
Hey!

353
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,056
Success!

354
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:58,139
It's really delicious, Joon Gu ah.

355
00:24:58,139 --> 00:24:58,929
For real?

356
00:24:58,929 --> 00:24:59,772
Yeah.

357
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:04,663
It's very delicious! It's the best!

358
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:05,093
Ha Ni.

359
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:12,613
If I cooked something well, I wanted you to be the first to taste it.

360
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:22,032
Wait a moment.

361
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:22,853
Here.

362
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,036
Try out this dumpling cut noodles.

363
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:28,163
It's got 3 colored dumplings of green, red, and yellow

364
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:30,167
and the chewy noodles are incredible!

365
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:33,055
If you try it, you'll definitely like it!

366
00:25:33,055 --> 00:25:35,463
Joon Gu ah..

367
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:36,854
Eat a lot.

368
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:41,196
Now even I've found something I'm confident in.

369
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:42,675
There is more.

370
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:51,865
Wait a second.

371
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:55,223
Today I saw a new side of Joon Gu.

372
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:58,451
I had always ignored him but

373
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:16,857
I'm sorry, Joon Gu ah.

374
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:18,225
Are you....

375
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:20,033
waiting for someone?

376
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:28,082
You're not going to sit?

377
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:36,501
Are you going to go to the 10 year anniversary for the tennis club this week?

378
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,241
Why? Are you curious?

379
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:42,052
It's pertaining to the club and there are going to be a lot of Sunbaes coming,

380
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:47,564
so if possible it would be nice if lots of people attended.

381
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:53,541
I'm not really interested in a meeting where people gather saying things they don't really mean.

382
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:54,966
Oh!

383
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:57,142
Why don't you go and enjoy it for me?

384
00:26:57,142 --> 00:27:03,003
That should do it.

385
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:04,317
Do you have anything else to tell me?

386
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:06,263
Yes?

387
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:07,997
Well..

388
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:11,972
I'm curious about something.

389
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:14,043
We already talked about the 10 year anniversary.

390
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:16,198
What is it?

391
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:18,407
Well.

392
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:22,335
You're undecided on your major, so have you picked one yet?

393
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,763
You're acting funny today.

394
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:26,754
Why are you curious about my major?

395
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:29,341
It's just...

396
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:35,517
To be honest ,you could go anywhere you please as long as you want to, right?

397
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,878
So..

398
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:41,174
So..

399
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:42,073
By any chance,

400
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:47,684
I was wondering if you were going to follow in the foot steps of Seung Jo.

401
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:49,535
Why do you think about these things?

402
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,407
You're really an idiot.

403
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:55,501
Just because the person you like is going, doesn't mean you have to go to hell with them too.

404
00:27:55,501 --> 00:28:03,349
Though I'm interested in Seung Jo, I don't care about the major he chooses.

405
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,787
I...

406
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:09,297
will do as I wish,

407
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:13,263
because it's my life.

408
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:19,712
You don't always have to be together to date.

409
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:22,027
Unnie will leave now.

410
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:26,093
See you.

411
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:33,312
She always ends it like that!

412
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,944
Well..

413
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,093
thinking that way is pretty cool.

414
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:46,384
Acknowledged.

415
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:53,327
Pay attention to what you're doing.

416
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:55,097
What are you doing?

417
00:28:55,097 --> 00:29:06,321
If you're going, leave. If you're staying, sit.

418
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:08,597
Joon Gu

419
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:13,166
is still working hard to become a chef.

420
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:17,003
And Hae Ra has things to do.

421
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:20,564
And so do Joo Ri and Min Ah.

422
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:30,208
Even Eun Jo seems to be worrying about his future.

423
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:35,388
And you have nothing? Is that what you mean?

424
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,692
o?

425
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,403
Yeah.

426
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,005
I envy you.

427
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,244
Your carelessness.

428
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:47,042
I, too...

429
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,277
have a dream.

430
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:50,898
But..

431
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:52,459
what?

432
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:59,374
Something you want to do with me?

433
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:00,897
Tell me...

434
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:03,015
about your dream.

435
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:10,109
I'll hear you out.

436
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,066
You know...

437
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,122
Seung Jo you're the doctor for a small village

438
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:19,659
and I'm the nurse that helps you.

439
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:22,847
You're famous so you're always at the hospital.

440
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:25,409
It's not a big hospital like the university ones,

441
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,931
but still, I try my hardest to help you.

442
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:34,807
Like attending to a crying child or something.

443
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:37,483
But..

444
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:39,038
there's a problem within that dream.

445
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:46,617
For example, if you say you want to become a pilot, then I want to become a stewardess.

446
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:51,122
And if you say you want to become a pro golfer, then I want to become a caddy.

447
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:54,123
In the end...

448
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:56,004
my dream is simple

449
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,969
and does whatever it pleases.

450
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:01,826
I..

451
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:07,253
am just moving in the direction of Baek Seung Jo, who is at the center of it.

452
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:10,043
There exists

453
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:13,751
no such thing as myself.

454
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,569
It's exactly as you said.

455
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:21,074
But when I decided to become a doctor,

456
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:25,013
I thought about it a lot too.

457
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,037
So what?

458
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:29,853
Even an unrealistic dream like that...

459
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:31,618
A dream is still a dream.

460
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:33,457
It fits you.

461
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,951
Hey!

462
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:38,609
Is it really that unrealistic?

463
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:40,852
Do you really think

464
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:45,332
you could become a nurse just because I'm going to be a doctor?

465
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:47,205
Then again a dream

466
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,185
the harder it is to attain . . .

467
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:54,271
the more you want to try it out.

468
00:31:54,271 --> 00:32:19,217
Right?

469
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:26,019
<i>Dad</i>

470
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:33,417
Have a seat over there.

471
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:34,977
Today someone from the university,

472
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:37,183
a medical professor, contacted me.

473
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:39,007
Ah, that?

474
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:42,183
Is it true that you're going to enter the medical program?

475
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,417
Yes.

476
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:46,383
I'm planning on entering the medical program starting next semester.

477
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,217
What?

478
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:53,035
Did you decide on your future without even discussing it with me?!

479
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:57,083
Have you been ignoring what I told you?

480
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,017
He seems to be angry.

481
00:32:59,017 --> 00:33:01,819
I thought about your company too, Father.

482
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,085
But like you, Father, and like Ha Ni's father...

483
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:10,317
I've decided I want to put my life on the line in order to do something I want to do.

484
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:12,783
Seung Jo, what I am saying,

485
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,617
my dream is. . .

486
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,144
I have decided to become a doctor.

487
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:19,085
Even if you say anything, it will be of no use.

488
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:24,483
I will not inherit your company.

489
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:33,617
Seung Jo, what did you just say?

490
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:35,055
Dad!

491
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,783
Dad!

492
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:38,883
Honey!

493
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,055
Dad!

494
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:43,005
Dad, what's wrong? Are you in pain?

495
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:45,283
Honey! Honey, come back to your senses!

496
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:54,055
Dad!

497
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:56,727
They said it's not life threatening.

498
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:59,917
The examination results are not out yet.

499
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:03,817
What exactly is wrong?

500
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,183
They say it's angina.

501
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:08,011
Angina?

502
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:13,025
Then he should have felt symptoms in his chest, feeling really uncomfortable or something.

503
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:15,683
He must have been pushing himself too hard.

504
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:19,191
Lately company work has been really hard.

505
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:19,983
I see...

506
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:22,025
Most importantly his condition needs to stabilize.

507
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,317
He will have to stay at the hospital for the time being.

508
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:25,717
Yes.

509
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:29,283
There are many good doctors here.

510
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:32,075
It must be very hard for you.

511
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:37,075
This person seriously... Even when he is having such a hard time he won't complain

512
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:44,065
Since he is always smiling, I didn't know either.

513
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,783
Mother.

514
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,065
Mother.

515
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:50,005
Oh?

516
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,683
I'll be going back first.

517
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:54,217
Because Eun Jo is alone.

518
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,035
Right. Thank you, Ha Ni.

519
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:59,075
You have to be careful too, Mother.

520
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:03,005
What if you collapse too?

521
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:08,883
Ha Ni.

522
00:35:08,883 --> 00:35:12,005
Seung Jo, <Br> you go as well.

523
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:13,517
Will you be okay?

524
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:16,717
I'm alright.Go home.

525
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,683
Alright.

526
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:25,892
Then, I'll come back tomorrow.

527
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:33,217
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

528
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:38,083
Will your father be okay?

529
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:41,217
It will be hard since he'll be getting physical examinations starting tomorrow.

530
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:45,683
I'm going to use this opportunity to fully rest up.

531
00:35:45,683 --> 00:35:53,025
I will have to take a break from school too.

532
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,051
<i>It's really hard on everyone...

533
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:58,183
<i> Even if for a little,

534
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:01,804
<i>I want to help too.

535
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:03,204
Sunbaenim, aren't you going to eat?

536
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,521
We'll see.

537
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:14,304
Sunbaenim, you should eat.

538
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,504
Hae Ra.

539
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:17,017
Sunbae.

540
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:20,637
You didn't come to the 10 year anniversary party.

541
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,137
I never said I was going.

542
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:24,054
Oh, so that's how it was.

543
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:27,154
I heard the only people that went were you and and the captain.

544
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:30,921
So I heard the party was a bit down in the dumps.

545
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:32,688
It turned out like that.

546
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:37,721
So I hear you had to use a lot of your own money.

547
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:44,754
I wasn't able to attend but I'll pay the fee.

548
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:49,821
Please accept it.

549
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:53,421
Thanks.

550
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:55,721
Is that what you're having for lunch?

551
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:58,221
Let's go together. I will buy lunch for you today.

552
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:02,854
Ah, no it's okay. I really like hot dogs.

553
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,089
And it's made from cow meat,

554
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:11,888
and it's really delicious, and If I have just one I'm full.

555
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,388
Is that so?

556
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:25,354
Then...

557
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:27,221
Is it not myocardial infarction (heart attack)?

558
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:30,088
I don't think it'll turn into a myocardial infarction.

559
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:32,065
But if he continues to overwork himself like this,

560
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:35,954
there's more than a chance for it to turn into a myocardial infarction.

561
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,021
If that happens the chances of surgery--

562
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:41,788
There's that method of using the femoral artery and doing a bypass graft.

563
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:44,088
Oh, you know well.

564
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:46,954
We would want to avoid that path.

565
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:50,754
So, with patience, we will treat him with medicine.

566
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:53,688
Yes.

567
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,365
You came?

568
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:56,654
Who is he?

569
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,188
He is the manager from your dad's company.

570
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,754
Do you not know that he has to stabilize?

571
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,088
This is totally prohibited.

572
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:04,654
It seems to be really important work.

573
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:06,221
Even so.

574
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:08,354
It'll be hard for him to recover like that.

575
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:12,803
You know how your father can't be at ease if he doesn't make the decision on his own.

576
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:20,854
He's been dead worried about work, that is why he collapsed like that.

577
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:21,988
Chairman Dad!

578
00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:23,421
Chairman!

579
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:24,421
Honey, what's wrong?

580
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:24,954
Dad!

581
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:41,388
Honey!

582
00:38:41,388 --> 00:39:09,121
[No visitors allowed]

583
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:15,421
That was a close one.

584
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:19,839
There's not many days left until the game is released.

585
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,088
After your father collapsed

586
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:30,554
the game developer left and vanished.

587
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:38,221
He heard that and that's why he collapsed.

588
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:41,554
What should we do?

589
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:45,121
Your father is just laying there

590
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:49,854
and his company is not in good shape.

591
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,821
I will have to go.

592
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:53,754
Seung Jo.

593
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:56,954
I'm still young and have no experience,

594
00:39:56,954 --> 00:40:03,154
but I'll take care of the company until Dad's health gets better.

595
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:10,921
Thank you Seung Jo.

596
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:13,388
Seung Jo said he would work in the company?

597
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:15,054
That's right.

598
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:19,121
Seung Jo's dad was happy and his condition is getting more stable.

599
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,588
He is getting better.

600
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,554
That's great.

601
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:27,054
And Seung Jo is returning to the house too.

602
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:32,054
He's doing as his father wished. I guess this is what you call turning a misfortune into an advantage.

603
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:36,621
Ha Ni I'm going to go to the hospital.

604
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:41,421
Will it be okay, that I'm leaving everything to you?

605
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:43,854
Yes, don't worry.

606
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:49,075
Right, I'll leave it to you.

607
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:54,417
Ha Ni this is your chance when there's no one to interfere!

608
00:40:54,417 --> 00:41:19,321
Try experiencing what it feels like to be on your honeymoon!

609
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:26,088
Aigoo, you arrived?

610
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:29,721
Everyone, Chairman's stand-in is here.

611
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,921
Say hello.

612
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,021
How do you do!

613
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:37,154
A gaming company's atmosphere is a bit like this...

614
00:41:37,154 --> 00:41:39,088
Ah, yes.

615
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:41,554
It's good.

616
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:47,054
This way. Please come this way.

617
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:54,635
Get up please.

618
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:55,907
Did you see him smile?

619
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,393
Ah, it's Yon-sama!

620
00:41:57,393 --> 00:42:00,004
They say his IQ is 200.

621
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:04,163
Aigoo, he's not going to fire me because I'm old right?

622
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:07,492
You should get ready.

623
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:11,647
Here are the documents regarding our company as well as new games.

624
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:17,855
Please look over this material. Should we have the meeting around 11?

625
00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:18,902
There's quite a lot.

626
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:21,563
Is that so? I'll try to read it fast.

627
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:23,621
Yes. Then...

628
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:24,893
Manager.

629
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:26,075
Yes?

630
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:27,793
When we're together, please speak comfortably.

631
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:32,698
Oh no, you are here as the interim CEO.

632
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:39,775
Then, I will be leaving.

633
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:42,044
Manager, he didn't talk about restructuring right?

634
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:43,084
Does he have a girlfriend? Is he dating anyone?

635
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:45,289
- Are we going to get fired?- How was he?

636
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:48,768
Aigoo, do not worry about other people is business and just focus on your work.

637
00:42:48,768 --> 00:43:05,084
- It's because we are worried!- Get back to work!

638
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:09,084
No, have you looked through all those documents?

639
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:12,207
This is the data that is compared to last year's data?

640
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:14,353
Yes, that's correct.

641
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:16,473
It looks like the profit has dropped significantly this year.

642
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:20,073
I think we may have been affected by the large scale push by international gaming companies.

643
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:21,094
Simply put,

644
00:43:21,094 --> 00:43:24,074
at this state, we are in a dangerous stage.

645
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:30,093
To add to that, the new game that was supposed to launch is gone as well. We're on thin ice.

646
00:43:30,093 --> 00:43:33,386
If we continue like this it'll be an operational crisis.

647
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:36,873
We're in a situation where even a merger is impossible.

648
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:50,605
Without some major support we may just...

649
00:43:50,605 --> 00:43:54,438
Eun Jo, you're really hungry, right? It'll be done in a few minutes.

650
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:56,084
Let's just order...

651
00:43:56,084 --> 00:43:58,073
What are you talking about?

652
00:43:58,073 --> 00:43:59,876
Restaurant food is high in calories.

653
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:01,339
With oil and salt,

654
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,207
you don't know how much they put in it.

655
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,773
And on top of that, they don't put much vegetables.

656
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:09,773
I got it, alright! Hurry up!

657
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:12,054
Next time, don't pretend like you know everything.

658
00:44:12,054 --> 00:44:16,024
Why don't you studying cooking?

659
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:17,004
Oh. What do I do?

660
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:21,058
What are you going to do if you get both me and Hyung sick too?!

661
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:28,035
Seung Jo has arrived.

662
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,707
You did well.

663
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:30,054
Are you very tired?

664
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:37,573
Hurry and change your clothing. Shower?

665
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:39,034
What are you doing?

666
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,094
I am taking off your jacket.

667
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,973
Why are you doing that?

668
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:47,007
What do you mean? She is acting like a new bride.

669
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:48,707
What are you saying?

670
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:50,707
Ahjusshi is at the hospital.

671
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:55,773
How could I be thinking such indecent thoughts?

672
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:59,024
You really are an indecent person.

673
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:14,573
Go get changed quickly!

674
00:45:14,573 --> 00:45:21,014
Today's menu is seasoned taro, grilled mackerel, and bean paste stew.

675
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:22,094
Eun Jo, eat it.

676
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:29,673
Here.

677
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:33,084
Oh gosh it's salty. Did you pour in the whole bottle of salt?!

678
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:40,773
Hyung, this does not taste good. So, I suggest that you do not eat this.

679
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:43,024
That sound...

680
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:45,073
The taro.

681
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:48,473
Taro makes a sound like that?

682
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:57,773
It's not fully cooked Hyung! Hurry and spit it out!

683
00:45:57,773 --> 00:46:00,044
Do not force yourself.

684
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:03,707
He swallowed it. Hyung, you'll get a stomach ache!

685
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:05,573
Baek Eun Jo,

686
00:46:05,573 --> 00:46:07,307
do not just complain.

687
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:09,306
Hurry and eat it.

688
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:13,034
Eat it? Which one?

689
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:33,573
Try poking it with your chopsticks and just eat the ones that are cooked.

690
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:36,307
<i> Even with a horrible meal,

691
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:49,373
<i> Seung Jo did not complain even once and just ate it.

692
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,207
Oh, Ha Ni!

693
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:53,607
It's Ha Ni?

694
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:56,004
What, packed lunch?

695
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:57,273
Why would you need to pack a lunch?!

696
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,673
Ah, Ha Ni's making packed lunch?

697
00:46:58,673 --> 00:47:01,004
How in the world could she do such a thing with such soft hands?!

698
00:47:01,004 --> 00:47:05,004
You're going to what?! I'm on the phone!

699
00:47:05,004 --> 00:47:09,044
Yes, okay.

700
00:47:09,044 --> 00:47:11,707
Seung Jo and Eun Jo's lunches.

701
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,407
Oh. Egg rolls?

702
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,074
- Egg rolls?- Egg rolls?!

703
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:21,007
How can you not be able to make something that easy?!

704
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:29,673
Our Ha Ni is making Baek Seung Jo's lunch?

705
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:33,094
You're out already. Did you grab your handkerchief? What about your wallet?

706
00:47:33,094 --> 00:47:35,034
I have it.

707
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:37,084
Here. Take this.

708
00:47:37,084 --> 00:47:39,044
What is it?

709
00:47:39,044 --> 00:47:42,507
What do you mean? It's lunch.

710
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:45,607
I'm going to eat at the cafeteria, so it's fine.

711
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:48,573
No, don't eat that stuff.

712
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:51,073
I woke up at the break of dawn and prepared this.

713
00:47:51,073 --> 00:48:00,207
The egg rolls are the point. When you open it, you'll be totally surprised.

714
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:03,004
See you!

715
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:05,507
See you.

716
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,094
You probably want to call him "hubby!"

717
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:09,007
What are you talking about?

718
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:11,054
Ahjushi is ill. That's so indecent.

719
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,573
New bride Ha Ni, a nickname given to yourself.

720
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:16,707
I, too, will see you later.

721
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:19,273
Goodness that youngster just says the darnest things.

722
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:24,004
Do a good job!

723
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,034
Ha Ni!

724
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:26,084
Oh.

725
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:28,014
Come with me for a second.

726
00:48:28,014 --> 00:48:29,084
Oh, I have class...

727
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:31,064
It'll just take a second.

728
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:35,084
Is it true that Seung Jo's father has been hospitalized?

729
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:38,973
That...

730
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:40,044
But you can't visit him!

731
00:48:40,044 --> 00:48:45,873
He needs to be stabilized. Visitors are prohibited.

732
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:51,607
How's Seung Jo doing?

733
00:48:51,607 --> 00:48:56,094
I am assuming Seung Jo is not allowed to visit either, right?

734
00:48:56,094 --> 00:49:01,407
He is currently working at Ahjushi's company.

735
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:05,373
That's why I have not been able to see him.

736
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:25,074
Thanks.

737
00:49:25,074 --> 00:49:26,973
Yes?

738
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:29,207
Are you eating lunch?

739
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:31,073
Yes. Why don't you join me?

740
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,084
No. It's okay. Enjoy.

741
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:36,054
It's a packed lunch.

742
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:39,607
Did your girlfriend prepare that?

743
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:41,207
What?

744
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:44,034
Well then, I'll come back after lunch.

745
00:49:44,034 --> 00:49:47,673
Yes.

746
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:52,773
Alright, a delivery of a special lunch box!

747
00:49:52,773 --> 00:49:55,607
Oh, hey, hey!

748
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:57,807
Do not eat that.

749
00:49:57,807 --> 00:49:59,573
Bong Joon Gu. What are you doing?

750
00:49:59,573 --> 00:50:03,074
I can not allow you to eat lunch that Ha Ni packed for you.

751
00:50:03,074 --> 00:50:06,507
Instead, you...

752
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:08,773
eat this.

753
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:09,044
Grilled eel?

754
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:13,873
From now on, I will come to this company everyday for the packed lunch Ha Ni made.

755
00:50:13,873 --> 00:50:16,807
I won't leave you alone if you eat the lunch. Ha Ni's packed lunch is for me.

756
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:20,073
Well then, thank you.

757
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:23,034
You did not poison this did you?

758
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:27,507
I do not play with fresh food!

759
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:29,064
I'll enjoy.

760
00:50:29,064 --> 00:50:48,373
Do not waste any of the eel and eat it all up.

761
00:50:48,373 --> 00:50:51,873
Let's take a look.

762
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:59,307
It's not bad.

763
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:02,273
Seeing Ha Ni's heart for Baek Seung Jo,

764
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:06,607
My heart is ripping apart.

765
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:10,054
But then again, I get to try out the lunch that Ha Ni made.

766
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:14,107
Alright.

767
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:19,024
Let's try this.

768
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:34,973
Ha Ni, I'm going to relish this.

769
00:51:34,973 --> 00:51:39,607
Oh Ha Ni, do you truthfully dislike Baek Seung Jo?

770
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:43,044
How can you possibly feed him this?!

771
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:50,707
But still, Ha Ni made it so I need to eat it.

772
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:54,573
Oh, I don't think I can eat this.

773
00:51:54,573 --> 00:52:17,507
<i>Brought to you by PKer team @ www.viikii.net

774
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:23,373
What are you doing this late at night without the lights turned on?

775
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:28,094
I am thinking.

776
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,573
What's the matter?

777
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:35,873
What's bothering you?

778
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:40,907
I can help...

779
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,907
Probably not, right?

780
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:45,507
Then, I am going to sleep first.

781
00:52:45,507 --> 00:52:47,373
Father's not doing well.

782
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,273
Huh?

783
00:52:48,273 --> 00:52:50,607
He might need surgery

784
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:54,014
Heart surgery?

785
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:56,273
That's such

786
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,084
a big surgery.

787
00:52:58,084 --> 00:53:03,807
I might need to continue working at my father's company for the time being.

788
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:07,573
It's just too much for father to handle.

789
00:53:07,573 --> 00:53:09,673
Then,

790
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:12,273
what about getting into medical school?

791
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,407
There is no reason that I have to go there.

792
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:19,034
There is.

793
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:22,307
This is the first time, is not it,

794
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:26,573
that you wanted to do something, your dream.

795
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:33,773
It's not much of a dream. Though I was smitten by it for a bit.

796
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:36,873
But once I do get into it...

797
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:39,707
I do not know how it's going to be.

798
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:43,373
Is it fun working at the company?

799
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:44,273
No, it's not.

800
00:53:44,273 --> 00:53:49,173
Then, what should we do? You said that you are gg to live an enjoyable life at graduation day.

801
00:53:49,173 --> 00:53:51,054
You promised in front of all those people.

802
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:53,973
I am not in the least bit interested but

803
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:58,673
if I work at the company, my father will be happy.

804
00:53:58,673 --> 00:54:02,707
Then at least, it is a half successful life.

805
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,773
I am not interesed but

806
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:12,024
if others are happy...

807
00:54:12,024 --> 00:54:16,014
What can you do?

808
00:54:16,014 --> 00:54:32,837
What to do?

809
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:34,087
Really? Baek Seung Jo?

810
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:50,937
Seeing he stopped by the student administration offices.

811
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:57,097
It seems like Seung Jo is planning to take over his father's company.

812
00:54:57,097 --> 00:55:01,537
As expected. I thought that if it were Seung Jo,

813
00:55:01,537 --> 00:55:04,097
would not do that

814
00:55:04,097 --> 00:55:09,388
His father's condition does noto be good.

815
00:55:09,388 --> 00:55:11,077
How do you know that . . .

816
00:55:11,077 --> 00:55:12,778
Oh my,

817
00:55:12,778 --> 00:55:15,937
is that something to be surprised about ?

818
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,766
It's something you can figure out if you put your mind to it.

819
00:55:19,766 --> 00:55:26,303
Especially how Seung Jo must be feeling right now.

820
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:32,215
I see that he is taken a leave of absence.

821
00:55:32,215 --> 00:55:34,007
I understand.

822
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:35,786
What?

823
00:55:35,786 --> 00:55:40,437
What do you know about Seung Jo?

824
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:45,103
I'm thinking about how to help him, that's why I said that.

825
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:46,903
What can you do ...

826
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:49,027
Oh Ha Ni...

827
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:54,097
How are you helping Seung Jo right now when he's going through such a tough time?

828
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:58,103
Following him around everywhere and getting in his way,

829
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,703
or whining,

830
00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:03,027
and telling him it's fine and that it's all going to get better...

831
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,506
Comforting him like that?

832
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:07,017
Right.

833
00:56:07,017 --> 00:56:10,057
You should at least do that.

834
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:17,494
Because those are the only things that Oh Ha Ni could ever do for Baek Seung Jo.

835
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:23,037
I'm going.

836
00:56:23,037 --> 00:56:29,057
Living in the 21st century and playing a 2D game is a bit boring,

837
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:34,836
but to play a different game, I mean there aren't many good games.

838
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:37,322
And when we do it's not that exciting.

839
00:56:37,322 --> 00:56:42,737
Let's use the strategy of turning all the negatives into positives.

840
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:49,403
I think it would be nice if we create a game that's approachable, graphically appealing, and in 3D.

841
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:52,037
I heard your IQ was 200, I see you really are a genius.

842
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:55,083
It's not like that.

843
00:56:55,083 --> 00:57:01,007
You just aren't utilizing your thoughts to their fullest.

844
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:04,103
Your brains are just a bit rusty because you haven't used them.

845
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:12,337
Now, shall we start deciding on the name of the game?

846
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:15,003
Rusty...

847
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:16,774
Rusty...

848
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:17,903
Rusty?

849
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:19,803
Rusty?

850
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:20,527
That's great.

851
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:22,498
See, see?!

852
00:57:22,498 --> 00:57:25,807
Wow, it's great.

853
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:33,643
Let's up the skills, actions, and combos.

854
00:57:33,643 --> 00:57:49,277
Yes that's right. The importance of the main character...

855
00:57:49,277 --> 00:58:29,577
This is where it gets fun.

856
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:31,243
Mother, did something happen?

857
00:58:31,243 --> 00:58:34,011
What would happen? There is nothing.

858
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,695
I just came to pick up some clothes.

859
00:58:36,695 --> 00:58:39,843
Oh I thought...

860
00:58:39,843 --> 00:58:43,733
Ha Ni, thank you, for filling in my empty place.

861
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,081
It's nothing.

862
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:47,669
It's something I have to do.

863
00:58:47,669 --> 00:58:51,243
Even so, I'm really relieved.

864
00:58:51,243 --> 00:58:54,839
Seung Jo is taking care of his father's company,

865
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,236
and you are taking care of the house,

866
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:01,177
I feel much more at ease.

867
00:59:01,177 --> 00:59:07,371
Seung Jo goes out to work early in the morning, and keeps working hard until late at night.

868
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:09,143
Is that so?

869
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:11,722
Really? It must be hard.

870
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:13,643
Ha Ni, are you doing okay?

871
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:15,743
You have to go to school and do the housework.

872
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:18,081
Of course I have to do it.

873
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:21,243
Ah, but, Mother.

874
00:59:21,243 --> 00:59:24,077
What? Do you have something to tell me?

875
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:27,343
I have something to discuss with you.

876
00:59:27,343 --> 00:59:28,115
What?

877
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:37,489
I'm going to be late, I'm going to be late.

878
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:39,477
Where are you going?

879
00:59:39,477 --> 00:59:42,677
Seung Jo. Can you give me a ride today?

880
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:45,205
Where are you going?

881
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:46,659
To the same place as you are.

882
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:47,977
The same place?

883
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:49,513
No way! You. . .

884
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:54,643
I got the approval to work part time at your father's company.

885
00:59:54,643 --> 00:59:55,729
Please take care of me.

886
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,877
Oh Ha Ni this Mr. Kim.

887
00:59:57,877 --> 00:59:59,677
Hello. My name is Oh Ha Ni.

888
00:59:59,677 --> 01:00:01,869
Oh, hello!

889
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:05,656
Everyone, she came in as a new employee. Say hello.

890
01:00:05,656 --> 01:00:08,001
Hello. I'm Oh Ha Ni. I will work hard!

891
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:11,978
Applause.

892
01:00:11,978 --> 01:00:20,039
If you all look after me, I will work hard. So please take care of me.

893
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:28,819
Our investor, President Yoon, is waiting downstairs.

894
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:34,786
Baek Su Chan was always busy bragging about his son, but I see it was all true.

895
01:00:34,786 --> 01:00:36,786
Not at all. You're too kind.

896
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:39,499
All right. How is your father doing in the hospital?

897
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:42,029
He is getting better,

898
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:46,706
but we thought this was an opportunity for him to take a break.

899
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:48,495
I guess I'll have to help a bit too.

900
01:00:48,495 --> 01:00:51,453
Yes. Please do.

901
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:53,193
Good.

902
01:00:53,193 --> 01:00:57,519
President Yoon this is a document regarding the game we're currently developing.

903
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:00,386
Oh, I've already read it.

904
01:01:00,386 --> 01:01:02,553
The game's name is "Rusty", right?

905
01:01:02,553 --> 01:01:03,253
Yes.

906
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,467
The idea of the game is very fresh.

907
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:06,719
Thank you so much.

908
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,947
With an heir like you, I'm sure Baek Su Chang feels relieved.

909
01:01:11,947 --> 01:01:15,359
You've got to make it into an even bigger company than what it is right now.

910
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:25,183
We've got to get past this hurdle and then think about that.

911
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:27,433
You have waited for a long time. It's coffee, right?

912
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,719
Oh right. Seung Jo-goon, how old are you?

913
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,074
I am 20 years old.

914
01:01:32,074 --> 01:01:35,219
Oh, you're still young.

915
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:39,153
Don't you have a girl friend?

916
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,319
I don't have one.

917
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,735
Why? It seems that you are very popular.

918
01:01:42,735 --> 01:01:46,026
Yes. President Baek Seung Jo is really popular.

919
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:47,119
Oh.

920
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,486
But he doesn't pay any attention to them. He enjoys reading and listens to mostly classic.

921
01:01:52,486 --> 01:01:55,931
He's also so very good at tennis, at which he's won many matches.

922
01:01:55,931 --> 01:01:59,875
His IQ is 200 too! He also cooks as well as any chef!

923
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:02,686
He is all around perfect.

924
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:05,386
That is amazing.

925
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:06,086
Miss Oh Ha Ni...

926
01:02:06,086 --> 01:02:06,097
Yes.

927
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:09,358
Would you leave now?

928
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:29,858
Yes, President Baek Seung Jo.

929
01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:30,491
You came?

930
01:02:30,491 --> 01:02:31,858
Oh, yes.

931
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:46,769
Do you have a second?

932
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:52,058
It seems meeting President Yoon was quite effective.

933
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:57,424
His employees came by and

934
01:02:57,424 --> 01:03:01,824
asked in detail about all the funds we need for the game.

935
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:04,991
Do you think they'll invest?

936
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:07,624
But that's...

937
01:03:07,624 --> 01:03:11,891
The chairman has come to like you very much.

938
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:17,891
Yesterday, he called me and complimented you a lot.

939
01:03:17,891 --> 01:03:29,624
The chairman has a grand-daughter. He asked me if you could meet with her sometime.

940
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:32,324
Are you talking about something like an arranged date?

941
01:03:32,324 --> 01:03:34,327
Oh. Yes.

942
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:39,891
He was saying how it would be a waste to marry off his grand daugther to just anyone.

943
01:03:39,891 --> 01:03:45,124
For our company, we're at a state where we need President Yoon's help.

944
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:49,958
I was a bit flustterd with his sudden comment.

945
01:03:49,958 --> 01:04:22,458
How should I respond?

946
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:28,058
Oh! You're here early.

947
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:28,891
Huh?

948
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:34,824
The stuff!

949
01:04:34,824 --> 01:04:36,731
Thank you.

950
01:04:36,731 --> 01:04:39,307
Let's have Bulgogi today. Lots and lots.

951
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:43,004
You seem tired these days so I have to pamper you.

952
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:49,507
And then everything that's giving you a hard time will all go away.

953
01:04:49,507 --> 01:04:54,004
Thank you.

954
01:04:54,004 --> 01:05:30,507
Thank you.

955
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:34,807
Oh, you arrived Seung Jo-goon.

956
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:44,004
Hello, Baek Seung Jo.

957
01:05:44,004 --> 01:06:00,507
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

958
01:06:00,507 --> 01:06:02,074
If you had to choose a son in law...

959
01:06:02,074 --> 01:06:09,064
who would you choose?

960
01:06:09,064 --> 01:06:11,274


961
01:06:11,274 --> 99:59:59,999
But still, it seems Seung Jo wasn't thinking about it at all.

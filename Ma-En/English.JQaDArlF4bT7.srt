00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:03,203
SelamunAleykum ve Rahmetullah ve Berekatuhu

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:07,544
Shukur YaRabbi Estagfurullah

3
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:16,205
Elhamdulillah

4
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:23,915
Asking support from our Shaykh,
Sahib ul Saif

5
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:26,624
Shaykh Abdulkerim el Kibrisi el Rabbani

6
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:33,534
Who is holding on tightly to the way 
of our Grand Shaykh

7
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,654
to the way our Resullulah SAW

8
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:41,736
bringing the light to the whole world

9
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:47,004
Bringing th elight to the lands where

10
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,678
there is no light, because the sun 
sets in the west

11
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,037
it doesn't rise in the west

12
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:55,695
Specifically he has been sent to the west

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,330
To this land to the America

14
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:06,007
And the light he brought was the light of the 
Holy Prophet SAW

15
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:12,022
the Icazet that was given to him,

16
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,246
when he first came to this country

17
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,245
to spread the teachings of real Islam,

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,210
to spread the teachings of the tariqat,

19
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:24,213
to spread the love of the holy Prophet SAW,

20
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,269
to these part of the world

21
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:30,241
where nobody has ever heard of islam

22
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:31,235
and if they did

23
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:36,236
is nothing but lies and slander and
wrong things

24
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:38,225
and we are very fortunate

25
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,243
Alhamdulillah

26
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:43,198
Ttat we know him

27
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:45,248
and we are under him

28
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:47,201
and that he has pulled us out

29
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:51,231
from the mess and the jungles of his
dunya and this cehennem.

30
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:54,251
Yes, because this dunya has turned into a
cehennem

31
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:56,217
and brought us here

32
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,286
to the top of the mountain

33
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:02,213
to live our faith

34
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,255
to live Islam

35
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:06,281
to live the lifestyle of the Prophet SAW,

36
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:10,243
according to his teachings according to the way of our Grandsheikh,

37
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:15,222
according to this Tariqat, according to the way of Rasulallah (SAV).

38
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,242
We did not come here to the top of the
mountain,

39
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:19,192
we did not come

40
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:20,274
to take Beyat with him

41
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:23,198
to show our

42
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,267
ego,

43
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:25,268
show our

44
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:27,198
opinions,

45
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,261
to show our minds,

46
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:33,226
we came and we gave beyat to him

47
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:35,208
to say  Sameena ve ataana

48
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:38,194
we're here and we obey of course our ego

49
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,209
that is the worst thing

50
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,254
that our ego

51
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:41,269
to our ego

52
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:45,248
to hear and to obey because the ego`s

53
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,232
nature

54
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:50,206
is to hear and disobey.

55
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:56,181
But Allah SAT saying to the
ego

56
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:58,231
"step forward,"

57
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:01,266
the ego stepped back, opposite.

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,230
When He said to the ego "move to the
right," ego moved to the left.

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,270
When He said to the ego

60
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,241
"move to the left", the ego moved to the
right.

61
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,178
When Allah is saying

62
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:14,259
to our egos  to you and  to mine

63
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,250
our ego, saying "who am I, who are you?

64
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,260
and our ego says, 'you are you and i am me!

65
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,179
you are you, you are existing!

66
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,198
I am existing!

67
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,259
you are

68
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:34,211
Lord, I am  a Lord!'

69
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,224
So, our egos are declaring that

70
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,219
and  the ego

71
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:44,224
hates to recognize another Lord,

72
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,232
that is the characteristic

73
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:50,204
of sheitan.

74
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:55,188
Because Sheitan is saying  'Yes, Allah is our Lord but

75
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:58,243
only according to what

76
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:01,193
i wanted to be

77
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,181
the way that i want our Lord to be.'

78
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:11,184
And when our lord Allah SWT  is saying to Adam, "do not

79
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:14,218
eat from the forbidden fruit"

80
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,241
placing restrictions there

81
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:18,183
and Adem AS,

82
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:19,257
with our mother Havva Ana

83
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:21,236
they made the mistake

84
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,179
and Adem AS

85
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,218
is asking for forgiveness

86
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,185
and Adem AS  asked for forgiveness

87
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,253
when you was sent down to the world

88
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,230
standing on one foot on the island of

89
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:37,205
Sri  Lanka for three hundred years,
crying and begging to Allah SWT

90
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:39,227
asking for forgiveness

91
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:41,238
and Allah has forgiven, but still.

92
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,193
Because that is the nature

93
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,222
of the spirit

94
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:49,166
that Allah SWT has created
put into man

95
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,236
and the nation of the spirit is it does not
want

96
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,239
to anger

97
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,255
that one

98
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,222
who has created him.

99
00:04:56,217 --> 00:05:01,237
He does not want to anger it's master, does
not want to anger his Lord

100
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:06,189
but the characteristic of the ego is the
complete opposite

101
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,203
is declaring

102
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,207
and always challenging

103
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,176
and when Allah SWT

104
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,205
is saying to

105
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:15,204
Shaitan

106
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,190
make  secde to Adem AS

107
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,216
and Shaitan says

108
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,202
that doesn't make sense to my idea

109
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:23,224
of what our lord

110
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:27,244
should do or should not do. How many of us
are doing that now, how many muslims

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,230
are doing that now?

112
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:30,217
how many

113
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,211
the people who says they follow a

114
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:33,194
master

115
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,160
they  follow a Prophet , they follow a master,they follow a Sheik

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,170
says that now?

117
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,175
It doesn't

118
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:40,186
makes sense to my head,

119
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,163
it doesn't make sense to my

120
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,236
understanding, it doesn't make sense to
my intelligence, what!?

121
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:49,194
No, I make secde only to you .I am not going to make secde to this one

122
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,169
that you have just created who did not even made one secde to you. Why I should

123
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,249
be making secde to him?

124
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,253
he should be making secde to me.

125
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,240
Of course Shaitan

126
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,232
he  has a different agenda

127
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,235
definitely

128
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:05,185
Shaitan  has a different agenda.

129
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,159
His agenda is to look

130
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,189
when he looked at the Makam-il Mahmud

131
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,200
that Allah SWT has created

132
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,232
and he's saying

133
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,234
I want that

134
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,244
it should be for me

135
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,225
but he knows that

136
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:22,166
he doesn't fit into that makam and he
knows that this new creature

137
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,224
that Allah SWT has created

138
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:28,252
this light of Prophet SAV,

139
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:31,209
fits into that Makam.

140
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:36,181
So, from that time until now Shaitan is going to go opposite

141
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,225
to what Allah SWT

142
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:42,171
has prepared for the children of men.

143
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:46,152
Walakad karamna bani Adam

144
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,214
"And we have honored

145
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:48,208
The bani Adem

146
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:51,214
the children of Adem."

147
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,149
Prophets they came,

148
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:54,223
Prophet SAV,

149
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:59,191
the seal of the prophets, the holy Prophet SAV came

150
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,153
and his inheritors,

151
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:04,167
the EvliyaAllah, and the Sheikhs
especially in this most distinguished

152
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:06,154
order, came

153
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,160
to make us,

154
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:08,184
to understand,

155
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,150
to come in to own reality

156
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,167
and to occupy

157
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,197
that place of honor.

158
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,160
That place of honor that Allah has said

159
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,228
"We have honored the Children of Adem."

160
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,200
That is the purpose

161
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:26,178
of the Sheikhs, that is the purpose of

162
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:28,143
the friends of Allah,

163
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:30,174
that is the purpose of the Murshids.

164
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,203
To change us,

165
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:32,188
to change

166
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,226
our nefs from Nefs-i ammaret to Nefs-i mutmain.

167
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:37,184
To change that nefs,

168
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,152
that is

169
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:41,192
together allies with the Shaitan,

170
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,205
to make our ego to be our vehicle,

171
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:48,143
that the spirit is going to ride on that ego

172
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,160
to bring us to higher stations. We can not

173
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:53,193
do that with books, we cannot do that
alone.

174
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:55,204
We can not even do it in a group.

175
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,146
We have to do it

176
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,153
with a Mursheed,

177
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,166
with a sheikh,

178
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,219
with a Varis el  Enbiya

179
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:05,174
the inheritor of the Prophet SAV.

180
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,165
The Prophet  SAV, he

181
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:14,161
came fourteen hundred years ago and,

182
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,141
that one

183
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,165
is hazir and nazir

184
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,150
that one who is

185
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,191
fresh and alive,

186
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:22,186
that one

187
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:25,222
who is inside of us, that one  who is everywhere

188
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:29,157
has also left inheriters and his
inheritors,

189
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:31,174
our Sheikhs

190
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:34,158
they are also following in the same
footsteps.

191
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,158
They have veiled from this world from this world

192
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:37,203
but  they are hazir and nazir,

193
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:39,194
definitely they are.

194
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:42,133
Because if Holy Prophet SAV is dead,

195
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:46,227
like so many they're claiming that he's
dead,

196
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,221
then, we're not responsible because we don't
follow

197
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:53,228
a dead prophet, we don`t.

198
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:55,223
We don't follow a dead prophet. That time,

199
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:59,136
we will not be responsible in the day of
judgment, Allah SWT

200
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,218
is questioning us

201
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:03,181
why we are not following the Shariat of the Rasulallah SAV.

202
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,149
But he's not dead,

203
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,158
those  who say that he is dead, their hearts are dead .

204
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,188
Definitely, they don't have connection to
that one,

205
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,149
that Allah SWT

206
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:18,192
has created everything in creation, you
and me,

207
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:21,223
the sun and the moon and the
galaxies, in everything in creation ,

208
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:25,134
that you know and you did not know that Allah is
continually creating

209
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,211
for the sake of that one.

210
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,216
So, he also has inheritors

211
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,198
and his inheritors are teaching us

212
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,149
how to come back to own reality, how to
come back to our own senses, how to hold

213
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:40,156
on tightly

214
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:44,125
to the lifestyle and the teachings and the sunnat of the

215
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,133
Rasulallah SAV,

216
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,144
that is going to fit according to these
times, according to this age and

217
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,149
according to the group that we're living
in.

218
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:53,193
So Elhamdulillah ,we are here, we`ve pulled ourselves away from this Dunya,

219
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,131
to be on top of the mountain,

220
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,129
only

221
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,181
to follow the teachings of the Prophet SAV

222
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,144
and his advice

223
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:07,137
to his nation in  the Ahir zaman, in the Ahir of the ahir zaman,

224
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,180
saying,

225
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:13,214
"O my nation, in the Ahir zaman there`s going to be so much fitna everywhere.

226
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,163
Pull yourselves back,

227
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:18,204
take a couple of sheep.

228
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:22,144
Pull yourselves to the mountains ,to the
secluded areas, away from the populated

229
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,133
areas.

230
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:26,161
Whatever little knowledge that you have,

231
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:30,153
don't go running around, searching and
investigating and arguing .

232
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,177
Take that small

233
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,192
knowledge that you have

234
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:36,189
and practice it sincerely,

235
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:38,168
live simply

236
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,200
and wait

237
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,193
because the time of the Sahibul Zaman

238
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:44,192
is right around the corner.

239
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:47,164
The time of the Sahibul Zaman,

240
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,217
it's going to come and we have reached to the ahir of the ahir zaman.

241
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:56,122
We've reached to the end of the end of the
end of times.

242
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,207
And the Ahir of the ahir zaman

243
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,197
it is not the time of paradise.

244
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,195
In the ahir of the ahir zaman,

245
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:05,168
it`s a time of great

246
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:11,137
tyranny and great confusion everywhere.

247
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,115
From the world,

248
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,184
to the countries,

249
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
through the muslim communities,

250
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,126
to the groups,

251
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,189
to the families, to the individuals

252
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:24,137
fitna is everywhere.

253
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,158
The fitna

254
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:28,176
of Deccal is everywhere. Yes,

255
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:32,206
because Deccal is going to
appear. He has already prepared.

256
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,140
We're asking the question,

257
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:35,123
why

258
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:37,133
in the month of Ramazan,

259
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,183
Shaitan is supposedly locked up but
people are still behaving

260
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,170
like shaitans.

261
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,195
People are behaving like they're
following shaitans.

262
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:48,165
People are behaving, completely holding on to shaitan .Why is that?

263
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,183
That is because

264
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:51,178
before shaitan has left,

265
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:54,203
he has prepared his deputies.

266
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,113
He has prepared

267
00:11:56,117 --> 00:12:00,127
our egos. Trained our egos well, he says
"I may be gone, heh

268
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,180
but now,

269
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,134
you are trained

270
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,159
very well by me

271
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:10,131
and be able to continue the work, even if
I'm not there."

272
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:10,201
Deccal,

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,130
the big one that is coming

274
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,165
so many has come, small Deccals.

275
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:18,163
Forty fifty deccals, huh... in these
days

276
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,140
countless deccals.

277
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:22,138
That he has,

278
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,180
these deccals have prepared  the world, prepared

279
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,114
countries.

280
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,145
Countries ,nations moving.

281
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,150
Communities moving,

282
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,129
groups, families, individuals moving and
accepting

283
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,176
the way of Deccal,

284
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,135
the way of fitna,

285
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,183
the way of this Dunya,

286
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,148
the way of tyranny,

287
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:46,161
so that when Deccal comes,

288
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,108
the task, it is so easy for him.

289
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:51,132
That majority of the people, yes

290
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,183
if they don't wake up to themselves,

291
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,140
muslims who don't wake up to themselves,

292
00:12:56,144 --> 00:13:00,144
they're going to look at Deccal and they are going to say yes,

293
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,130
this make sense.

294
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,130
We are going to follow you

295
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,123
because

296
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:08,157
you are going to give

297
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,135
what we're looking for.

298
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:16,097
And what are muslims are  looking for
these days, ask, think,

299
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,146
sit down, ask yourself!

300
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:21,099
What are you looking for?

301
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:24,184
Are you looking for

302
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:26,158
the Prophet?

303
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,110
If you are looking for the Prophet SAW,

304
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:33,194
you're going to find, look, consult
and be with his inheritor,

305
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,121
be with his

306
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:36,148
varis

307
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:37,124
be with a

308
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,130
WaliAllah,

309
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,102
be with a Sheikh

310
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,181
and you're going to say, this one is
representing the Prophet I'm looking for.

311
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:44,164
That one, so now I'm having him,

312
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,145
i'm going to hold on tightly to him.

313
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,150
Of course he is going to do

314
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:51,166
and he's going to say and he's going to
advice things that is not going to be

315
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,109
good for my ego. My ego is never
going to accept.

316
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:57,093
My ego is allies with Shaitan

317
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,128
but my spirit is going to be free that time.

318
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,114
My spirit

319
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:04,162
is looking for the Prophet SAW and I am
looking for the shariat,

320
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,086
the shariatullah,

321
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:09,137
the shariat of the Prophet SAW,

322
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:13,108
the way of the Prophet SAW.

323
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:15,141
Are muslims looking for that?

324
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:18,093
Are muslims looking for

325
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:20,143
holding on tightly to the shariat

326
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:23,106
that Holy Prophet brought

327
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,179
the shariat that is

328
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:27,184
the justice

329
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,150
that has been missing from this world

330
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:31,099
especially

331
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,086
in the past hundred and less than a
hundred fifty years.

332
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:37,138
The shariat there was held on tightly
by our ancestors

333
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,081
held on tightly

334
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,093
especially

335
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,179
by the Ottomans who brought justice

336
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:46,118
east, west. north and south.

337
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,100
Do they have enemies? Of course they do,

338
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:50,127
and they will continue to slander them
too

339
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,118
and all muslims are slandering them,

340
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:53,098
definitely.

341
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:56,118
Muslims are slandering the Halifa.

342
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,157
Masha'Allah, masha'Allah!

343
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,089
Very good for you.

344
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,119
Prepare yourself that time.

345
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,140
Because the Holy Prophet SAW  is saying,

346
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:05,161
do not against your Halifa.

347
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,155
Do not rebel against him.

348
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,160
to be awwam (???)

349
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:10,095
to do umum (???)

350
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:13,084
Do not rebel against him,

351
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,129
even if he takes the skin of your back.

352
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,127
The whole nation of islam

353
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,101
are we running towards that?

354
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,172
Looking for shariat,

355
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,081
looking for the shariatul Rasul,

356
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,146
looking for the Halifa to come back,

357
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,111
to live according to the way of the Prophet
brought.

358
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,088
or, our nations

359
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,106
looking for what?

360
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,134
The lands

361
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:37,168
where the sun has set

362
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,150
has to offer.

363
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,103
You don't have to be a genius to answer
that

364
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,127
or sing.

365
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,125
Are they looking for

366
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:50,142
a Halifa, a representative of that

367
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:52,146
Prophet SAW and to live

368
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,137
by his words to live by his law.

369
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,103
It's already showing if we are

370
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:58,115
then we will all have

371
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:04,108
Sheikhs, and we will have masters and we will all hold on tightly to them,

372
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:06,156
and obey them

373
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:09,097
and not have any problems with them.

374
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,123
Or do we always have problems with our
masters saying,

375
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:15,153
'I like this part but I don't like that part.'

376
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:19,078
'This is Ok, but that is not Ok.'

377
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,088
I like this one before,

378
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:24,098
now you change it and you like.. No.

379
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,108
So we have to check ourselves,

380
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:29,103
because preparing for the time of
Mahdi AS

381
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:30,147
it is not the easy,

382
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:33,072
these are not easy times,

383
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,139
these at times of complete darkness.

384
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:38,091
Sheikh Mawlana Hazretleri said so many times,

385
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:41,152
our Sheikh Efendi Hazretleri said so many times

386
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,084
it is time of dark, darkness

387
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,085
this is the time sorrow is covering everywhere

388
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,078
where the dark clouds are covering everywhere,
people are looking

389
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:53,107
muslims are looking, the hadith is saying dark clouds, where is the dark clouds?

390
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,130
Looking with these eyes, but they're
not understanding

391
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,080
their hearts, our hearts, the muslims' hearts have already been clouded.

392
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:01,087
It's already dark,

393
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,098
because we are not looking to ahirat.

394
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,136
We are not looking to the Holy Prophet SAW what he has to say.

395
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:09,118
We are not looking to the murshids,
we are not looking to the sheikhs and we are not

396
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,146
looking to Awliya Allah.

397
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:13,148
But we are looking to what our ego wants,
we are looking to what this dunya

398
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:18,073
has to offer to make this dunya
to become a paradise, don't we understand?

399
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:21,088
Don't you understand this is the ahir zaman? Don't you understand this is the ahir or ahir zaman?

400
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:26,085
We are following the Prophet of the ahir zaman.

401
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:27,114
As believers,

402
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:31,081
we should not be preparing ourselves to
live in this will world comfortably.

403
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,114
As believers,

404
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:35,099
we should be preparing to make our ahirat

405
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,079
better than our dunya.

406
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,143
To live in this dunya

407
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:41,064
as travelers.

408
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,086
Nations

409
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:44,099
have lost their direction.

410
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:47,073
Nations' leaders have lost their direction,

411
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:49,103
they have lost their compass.

412
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:55,123
Nations' Alims and Ulamas - they've
completely lost their compass.

413
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:58,146
They are under the payroll,

414
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:01,137
and they are looking.

415
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:05,072
Not what Allah and His Prophet has to say,

416
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,154
but who is paying them,

417
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,131
who has the power

418
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:12,125
to shut them out or to open their
mouth what those ones, what those ones have to say.

419
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:16,117
Fitna,

420
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Holy Prophet SAW said

421
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,101
will come out

422
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,130
from the scholars of my nation

423
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,112
in the ahir zaman,

424
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:26,058
will come from them

425
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:27,115
and will circle around

426
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:30,127
and they will come back to them,

427
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,134
and a big curse is coming to them.

428
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,093
So, not for us to run

429
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,087
these times

430
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:36,056
to be come

431
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:37,062
scholars,

432
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,100
to know so much,

433
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:41,102
take whatever little knowledge that we
have

434
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:45,053
and practice it sincerely,

435
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,075
and prepare

436
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,083
for the grave.

437
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,060
Prepare for the hereafter,

438
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:52,097
make preparation for that, not for this dunya.

439
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:54,111
Are muslims preparing that?

440
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,124
Definitely not.

441
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,113
Preparing, wishing

442
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:00,131
that this spring is going to turn into
summer.

443
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:02,051
What spring?

444
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,070
They are saying Arab spring.

445
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:06,112
Eh, it's been a year and a half years already

446
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:09,148
spring is never finishing? Masha'Allah.

447
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:11,144
It's spring. No. It fell down.

448
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,080
It didn't spring, it flopped.

449
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:20,074
Same things happening, why?

450
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,096
Gather, be together

451
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,129
and ask

452
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,119
for the sahibu zaman to come.

453
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:28,058
because only he will come with a divine
power

454
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:29,099
to break the system

455
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,105
of dajaliyat,

456
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:32,097
to break the system of the shaitan,

457
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:36,047
to break the system where the ego is
running completely free,

458
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:37,077
to break the system where everyone

459
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:40,083
is declaring themselves lords.

460
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,130
Where nations' leaders, nations' alims

461
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:46,133
and those ones who are in authority are not warning and keeping their nations in check

462
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,131
and to say

463
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:50,081
do not

464
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,110
pass your limits.

465
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,107
We are servants,

466
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:57,124
do not cross into that other side

467
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,080
to follow

468
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,064
what shaitan has been

469
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:05,106
planning for these thousands of years to
welcome the time of dajjal. Yes.

470
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,093
We are in the time of dajjal.

471
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:10,123
We are not during the time, we are in the time of Mahdi AS,

472
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:12,138
definitely not.

473
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,103
What, you need proof for that?

474
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,130
Don't you see this whole world?

475
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,093
Right now we are comfortable, we just
finished iftar

476
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,134
we finished making zikir, we are going to make prayers.

477
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:28,059
Don't think that this whole world is
like this.

478
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,129
Half of this world is burning,

479
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,070
half of this world they are suffering,

480
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,081
and the leaders of this world they are coming
together

481
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:38,075
and they are planning what?

482
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,089
To make this world into a paradise,

483
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,099
or they are planning

484
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:44,061
to turn this world

485
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:45,067
into a hell?

486
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:48,132
To burn this whole world.

487
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:49,107
So, which type

488
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:51,051
are we living in?

489
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:54,104
If we are living in a very dangerous
times

490
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:56,134
which sad to say not too many people

491
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,099
not too many.

492
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,123
Those ones who have

493
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,055
authority and those ones have knowledge
they are warning the people

494
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,084
that we are living in very dangerous
times we are living the times of dajjal,

495
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,102
they are not warning them.

496
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:10,086
That is not in their agenda, because this

497
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:11,117
wishing and

498
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:16,298
hoping this world is going to last
longer forever if necessary

499
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:20,027
and for them to have more comfort them a
luxury from this world

500
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:23,347
but the signs that Holy Prophet SAW
has said

501
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,106
about the coming of deccal

502
00:21:25,106 --> 00:21:28,656
about the cebabire time, it's
already here

503
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,955
we're living in it

504
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:34,245
we're living

505
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:36,665
dangerous times

506
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:39,164
very dangerous

507
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,994
what do we do in dangerous times

508
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:44,104
we sing and we dance

509
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,403
we enjoy ourselves

510
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:49,893
uh...  are we preparing ourselves

511
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,933
for the murids of our Seyh

512
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,761
Holy Prophet SAW

513
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,472
has given to us

514
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:58,862
and advise and a warning

515
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,821
for us to keep ourselves clean

516
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,311
keeping ourselves clean

517
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,170
to prepare for the time when the Mehdi AS is going to come

518
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:09,399
prepare for that time

519
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,069
to make ourselves to more useful

520
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,119
to the Shariat

521
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,529
to the laws

522
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,689
that Allah SWT has brought

523
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:19,678
Holy Prophet SAW
teaching his nation that is not going to

524
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:24,528
change until Kiyamet

525
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:26,348
prepare ourselves for that

526
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:27,857
get ourselves used for that

527
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:30,827
are we getting more and more used to new
and new things

528
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:33,257
Are we getting more used to innovations

529
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:37,027
are we getting more used to new things
being introduced

530
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:37,756
our group

531
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,506
into tariqat into islam

532
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,266
what are we

533
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:43,054
looking for

534
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:45,254
is that what we're looking for

535
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:46,475
we will find it

536
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,955
if that's what we're looking for

537
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:51,244
deccal is going to bring it

538
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,574
deccal is going to bring and
he's going to say

539
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,364
this world it is a paradise

540
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:58,583
but this world

541
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,893
it is a hell

542
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:05,353
from the skies to the earth to the
waters to the air,this world

543
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,932
this planet

544
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,292
we have turned it

545
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:11,082
into a hell

546
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:13,981
who's saying otherwise

547
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:17,841
which ignorant one's going to say otherwise

548
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,460
and deccal is going to say no

549
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,000
we are going to continue with this

550
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,540
and we're going to continue

551
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,299
to use the world and to suck the world

552
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:33,029
and to make it into a paradise for us

553
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:36,998
but that Sahib ul Zaman is going to
come

554
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,028
and he's going to say

555
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:41,567
do not believe that

556
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,247
because now is a time

557
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:44,397
when black is white

558
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,166
and white it's black

559
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:48,295
and unless you are following a Seyh

560
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,406
and consulting with him

561
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,226
and holding on to him tightly

562
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:55,656
and not being rebellious and challenging

563
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:59,655
when the very dangerous times comes there
is no more time for explanation

564
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,075
for arguing

565
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,614
that is a time

566
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:04,154
insAllah u Rahman

567
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,524
we'll be in safety

568
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,924
blindfolds will be put to us insAllah

569
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:09,772
for us not to understand

570
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:10,713
that is

571
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:13,533
stepping on the edge of a cliff

572
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:17,672
and we will hear his voice to say just
walk don't turn left and right

573
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,222
just walk follow me

574
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:21,552
that is the time

575
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:24,251
we're living in those times

576
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,051
so we need to check ourselves

577
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:27,771
we need to check ourselves

578
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:30,491
are we preparing ourselves for the Shariat
to come

579
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,470
uh... we're getting more and more use to
Shariat

580
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,710
in our lives

581
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,840
are we getting more and more use of the
laws in the orders

582
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,629
that our Seyh has put into our life's and
to hold onto that tightly

583
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,079
and not change

584
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,999
are we looking for an out now

585
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:48,228
especially since his past for a change

586
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:49,308
for uh...

587
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:52,617
adjustment

588
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:56,357
if we are

589
00:24:56,357 --> 00:25:00,557
there's a very big danger up ahead

590
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:03,776
it we are

591
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:05,176
it is going to be very

592
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:08,814
difficult times for us

593
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:11,135
if we're holding on tightly

594
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:15,885
he's going to carry us trough insAllah ur Rahman

595
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:18,254
as much faith and as much sincerity that we have

596
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:22,194
and as much obidience that we have

597
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:24,193
we will be in safety

598
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:26,293
here in here after

599
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,652
we have a big job ahead of us

600
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:29,951
our job

601
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:31,612
our intension

602
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:34,272
our mission is to continue his mission

603
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:35,811
and his mission

604
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,901
is to bring down kufur

605
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:39,401
to bring down

606
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:42,521
disbelief and unbelief

607
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,160
that time when the war comes it is no
longer

608
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,900
with Muslims and Christians or Muslims and
Jews and know it is  between believers

609
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:51,059
and unbelief

610
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,339
because they are believers everywhere in
every religion and there are unbeleivers

611
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,538
with the appearances that you believe

612
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:03,507
in every belief in every religion in
every group

613
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:08,576
if we are preparing ourselves for the
time of Mehdi AS

614
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:12,117
when he comes and he's going to come
with nothing but the Shariat of the Resullulah SAW

615
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:15,415
we're going to be happy

616
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:17,445
we're going to be in safety

617
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:20,435
it we're looking for changes
if we're looking for

618
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,295
completely no Shariat

619
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:28,775
but we're looking for mixing everything
together

620
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:32,634
then deccal is going to offer as that

621
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,882
it is already here

622
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,813
it is already

623
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:40,603
because this Shariat this separation of Hak and batil

624
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:43,552
this separation

625
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,392
it is very strange

626
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:46,621
to people living

627
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,941
these modern times

628
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,121
They say we're very backward people

629
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,671
we have a strange antiquated

630
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,140
we have a strange old fashion people who
have no touch

631
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:58,159
with reality

632
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,890
if this is a reality

633
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:02,048
this cehennem out there is reality yes

634
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:04,959
we have no touch we're not in touch
with that reality

635
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:09,059
but we in touch of the reality that our Seyh

636
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:13,648
that he has brought from our Grand Seyh
from Holy Prophet SAW

637
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:15,028
we're in touch with that

638
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:16,896
and we're very happy with that

639
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:18,847
we're not here to please the world

640
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:23,767
we're not here to please this dunya
to please this society that we're living in

641
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:26,476
we respect everyone we love everyone

642
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:29,386
and want to live according to that
respect and the love

643
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:30,264
that is nothing

644
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:33,764
but is contained in the holy Shariat of Prophet SAW

645
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:35,144
though the Ottomans had brought

646
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:37,414
bringing justice

647
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:41,144
to Muslims Muslim Nations different
Muslim Nations

648
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,933
and to Christian nations and to
Jewish Nations

649
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,603
believers and unbelievers

650
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:47,473
giving each one their rights

651
00:27:47,473 --> 00:27:49,103
and we are

652
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:53,183
waiting for those days to come insAllah ur Rahman

653
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,252
we preparing ourselves for that

654
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:58,732
and to keep ourselves holding on tightly
to the way

655
00:27:58,731 --> 00:27:59,641
of our Seyh

656
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:05,101
to the way of our grand Seyh to the way of
Prophet SAW

657
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,730
we're not here

658
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,950
wanting to build

659
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,840
palaces for ourselves

660
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,820
the drive big

661
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,679
fancy cars wear nice clothes to eat to drink
No

662
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:16,889
that's why we are here on the
top of the mountain

663
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:21,129
that is why you have taken biat
with our Seyh

664
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:23,087
to say let us begin this first step

665
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:25,038
where we die before we die

666
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,808
where we gonna turn away

667
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:30,767
from this world and turn our faces to the Uhva

668
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:33,467
to the reality to the Ahiret

669
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,246
to turn our face

670
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,456
to that reality

671
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:37,726
that our Seyh has brought

672
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:41,556
from his Grand Seyh from the Holy Prophet SAW

673
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,335
that this the reality

674
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,925
this is not reality,this is fake

675
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,275
and it's passing

676
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:51,763
and this dunya has no value

677
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:52,874
has less value

678
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:55,533
than a wing of a mosquito

679
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,953
as Holy Prophet SAW is saying
Allah SWT is saying

680
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:02,443
inshaAllah ur Rahman

681
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,982
we are asking Allah SWT

682
00:29:04,982 --> 00:29:06,192
to bless our Grand Seyh
to bless our Seyh

683
00:29:06,192 --> 00:29:10,132
to raise their stations higher
and higher

684
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:11,631
for us to hold on tightly

685
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,630
to them

686
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,770
and for the himmet

687
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:15,151
and the Medet

688
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,501
come to us

689
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,370
for us to continue this way strongly

690
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,940
for things

691
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,540
to get bigger and to get stronger for us
not to deviate

692
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,119
for the sake of this holy month for the
sake of this holy nights for the sake

693
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:37,119
of the most beloved one in the divine presence

694
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:40,507
Fatiha

695
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:47,767
to everyone who's watching us

696
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,896
inshaAllah ur Rahman

697
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:51,166
this

698
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,996
time this day

699
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,534
next week

700
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:55,775
we will be

701
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:58,115
celebrating commemorating

702
00:29:58,115 --> 00:30:00,995
the fortieth day of of our Seyh

703
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:05,273
Shaykh AbdulKerim el Kibrisi el Rabbani

704
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:06,824
if Allah gives us long life

705
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:10,373
that is what we're going to do will have Zikr
we will continue the program

706
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,613
we're not going to change

707
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:14,493
so be with us

708
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:17,452
Allah has opened the doors Allah has
opened the doors also for this

709
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:18,622
technology

710
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,372
to be used in the way of islam

711
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,582
we are not relying on this technology

712
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:27,851
because we are relying on the technology of
our Shaykh technology of the Evliyaullah

713
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:30,021
but this is come to us

714
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,880
and we're using it use it for the sake of Allah
that time it's going to be blessed

715
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,509
but we're not relying on it

716
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:39,409
because the first thing that is going to
go when Mehdi AS calls the Tekbir

717
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,229
it's electricity

718
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:42,699
that time

719
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:45,129
if you don't build this technology

720
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:46,557
this technology

721
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:47,708
with the Shaykh

722
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,248
this technology

723
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,338
with a community

724
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:55,797
if we just relying on this camera this
electricity

725
00:30:55,797 --> 00:30:57,627
easily can be cut

726
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,565
that time

727
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,736
your connection will be lost

728
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,095
and you will be lost

729
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:04,186
will be lost forever

730
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:06,326
big loss coming to us

731
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:07,705
big confusion coming

732
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:10,825
in those days to bigger confusions

733
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,355
we don't want to do that

734
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:14,944
because with the end of the race

735
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,064
the race is almost done, dont quit now
don't turn now

736
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:24,433
there is a tape is there we're running
towards the tape now whole world is

737
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:27,463
looking for that foolish olympics are

738
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:30,892
not understanding what it is

739
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:32,382
but that tape there

740
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:33,892
we almost there

741
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:34,741
there's a lot of

742
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,230
darkness now definitely

743
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:40,281
but don't suddenly now because you're
running there and you seeing something

744
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,241
and you running towards to other direction

745
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:45,419
running to the left direction, no dont

746
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,800
keep on going straight ahead

747
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,350
it may seem

748
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:51,789
because there's a lot of confusion now

749
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,909
there's a lot of dust
like they say in Turkish

750
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:58,458
you all know

751
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,647
when the dust settles

752
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,438
whether it is a donkey

753
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:04,747
or a horse

754
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:05,987
so there's a lot of dust

755
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:09,376
covered now

756
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:13,176
as long as we're holding on tightly to
our Shaykh inshaallah we will not

757
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:18,336
be the losers

758
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:19,955

760
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:27,954

761
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:31,953

you wish to do, to participate

to make this way stronger and clearer

767

to make this work that we're doing
to progress

768
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:49,851

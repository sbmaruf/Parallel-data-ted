1
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:46,746
Kang Hwi.

2
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,990
&lt;i&gt; Last Episode &lt;br&gt; - Part 2 - &lt;/i&gt;

3
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,877
The house feels empty.

4
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:34,922
Kang Hwi-nim?

5
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,341
Not Kang Hwi-nim, but Tae Ik-nim.

6
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:40,117
Lee Tae Ik, what brings you here?

7
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:41,588
What do you mean what brings me here?

8
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:43,321
This is actually my house.

9
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,930
That’s true.

10
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:47,407
Weren’t you moving in all together tomorrow?

11
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,890
It is tomorrow.

12
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,007
I came today to get you.

13
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,097
Pack your bags quickly.

14
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:51,652
What?

15
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:53,837
You need to go ask Grandpa for forgiveness, don’t you?

16
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,266
Aren’t you going back home?

17
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:57,565
I should...

18
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:00,172
I must, but…

19
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:02,039
Hurry, pack your bags and come down.

20
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,448
I will go with you.

21
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:06,598
- Ah! &lt;br&gt; - Hurry, let’s go in.

22
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:09,647
First go in and say that you are absolutely sorry.

23
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,021
Then Grandpa will also forgive you.

24
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,191
Lee Tae Ik, you are saying this because you don’t know.

25
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,664
If Grandpa gets angry, he is really scary.

26
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:18,781
Why did you rebel against him when you knew that? &lt;br /&gt;Fearlessly!

27
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,428
Ah! That is because…

28
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:23,038
It's because I couldn’t help it then.

29
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:25,987
Then are you going to keep being in &lt;br&gt;this kind of relationship with Grandpa?

30
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:27,572
No.

31
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:30,127
Then... &lt;br /&gt;Hurry, let’s go in.

32
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:30,986
Ah! Wait a moment.

33
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,204
I tell you I am not yet ready.

34
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,783
What to do then?

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,810
Who is being so noisy in front &lt;br /&gt;of someone else’s house?!

36
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:46,175
Gr… Grandpa!

37
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,340
Grandpa?

38
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,348
Am I your grandpa?

39
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:54,544
I don’t have a granddaughter like you!

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,310
Where do you think this place is &lt;br&gt; that you dare step foot in here?

41
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:59,938
Grandpa… that is…

42
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,451
Grandpa…

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,590
Just once... &lt;br /&gt;Please forgive me just once.

44
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,498
Grandpa!

45
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:13,528
It wasn’t enough to deceive your grandpa.

46
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:17,043
You dare go against what I said?

47
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,366
Grandpa.

48
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,824
I wasn’t trying to go against your words.

49
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,569
I had to stay there with him then.

50
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,798
Grandpa, you said that.

51
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:30,822
A true friend is one who stays by a &lt;br /&gt;friend's side when he is in difficulty.

52
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,856
I... As I learned from you,

53
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:38,117
I just guarded my loyalty to a friend.

54
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,962
So, Grandpa… &lt;br&gt;Can’t you forgive me just once, please?

55
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,252
You bad thing!

56
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:48,787
You try to win against your grandpa to the end!

57
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,960
I have no energy.

58
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,308
Let’s have chueotang. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(ground loach in hot bean paste soup)&lt;/i&gt;

59
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,750
Grandpa!

60
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,677
Stylist Jang! Stylist Jang!

61
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,714
Jang Man, good job!

62
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:15,493
Indeed, my bed is the best!

63
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:23,282
Wh… what are you doing?

64
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,241
On someone else’s bed?

65
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:26,627
What?

66
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,019
You said it was nice, so I just lied down.

67
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:35,945
The cushiony feeling… mine is better.

68
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,118
Really...

69
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,163
I am grateful, Elder.

70
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:11,563
Still...

71
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:15,293
Since you are leaving here after &lt;br /&gt;achieving what you wanted,

72
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,571
so, it is highly rewarding to me.

73
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:21,965
Anyway, when you get back, please take care.

74
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:24,149
Visit once in awhile

75
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:26,236
and let's say hello.

76
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:27,854
- Here. &lt;br&gt; - Yes.

77
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,314
I will visit frequently.

78
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:39,795
&lt;i&gt; Hey! &lt;/i&gt;

79
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:42,546
&lt;i&gt; You are asking me to sleep in a tent? &lt;/i&gt;

80
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:43,978
&lt;i&gt; Why? I can’t do that?&lt;/i&gt;

81
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,291
&lt;i&gt; Now, I am the owner of the house. &lt;/i&gt;

82
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,468
&lt;i&gt; It is up to the owner to decide &lt;br&gt;where to make you sleep. &lt;/i&gt;

83
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:48,925
&lt;i&gt; You are a fool. &lt;/i&gt;

84
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,339
&lt;i&gt; Why am I a fool? &lt;/i&gt;

85
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,556
&lt;i&gt; But why have you been continuously saying that since from before? &lt;/i&gt;

86
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,859
&lt;i&gt; I also like you, Lee Tae Ik. &lt;/i&gt;

87
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,437
Lee Tae Ik!

88
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:03,856
Yes.

89
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:04,807
Gr... Grandpa!

90
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,478
Do well.

91
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,281
Even when you return, think about your stamina

92
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:11,367
and keep training diligently.

93
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,059
I will keep an eye on you continuously.

94
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,784
I will bear that in mind.

95
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:21,316
Then, we will be off, Elder.

96
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,088
Let's go.

97
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:26,688
Take care on your way back!

98
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,981
Yes.

99
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,346
&lt;i&gt; What is this? &lt;/i&gt;

100
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,314
&lt;i&gt; It’s the documents to Full House. &lt;/i&gt;

101
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:52,034
&lt;i&gt; I took care of it. &lt;/i&gt;

102
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:17,035
&lt;i&gt; Don’t ever stay apart.&lt;/i&gt;

103
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,718
&lt;i&gt; And stick right next to her. &lt;/i&gt;

104
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,258
&lt;i&gt; “I like you.” &lt;/i&gt;

105
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,595
&lt;i&gt; “You are pretty.”&lt;/i&gt;

106
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:24,975
&lt;i&gt; And say things that give you goose bumps often. &lt;/i&gt;

107
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:28,314
&lt;i&gt; So that she will never cry over anything at all. &lt;/i&gt;

108
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:30,067
&lt;i&gt; So that she can always smile. &lt;/i&gt;

109
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:34,235
&lt;i&gt; Guard her by her side. &lt;/i&gt;

110
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,852
&lt;i&gt; No matter how much I try, &lt;br&gt; it is something that I can’t do. &lt;/i&gt;

111
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:41,052
&lt;i&gt; If it is you, you can make Man Ok happy. &lt;/i&gt;

112
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:57,763
Lee Tae Ik?

113
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:02,888
Why? I am on my way to work out.

114
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:03,744
- Let’s go. &lt;br&gt;- Where?

115
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,910
To have fun!

116
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,553
Why suddenly?

117
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:07,606
Where are we going?

118
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:09,136
Some place good!

119
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,975
Wait, then, let me at least change.

120
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,659
What is this? &lt;br /&gt;You said let’s go to some place good.

121
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,433
It’s just here?

122
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,700
You said that you are going to change.

123
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:23,883
Clothes?

124
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,225
Go to the room, change and come out.

125
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,675
I took all my clothes home, so there aren’t any here.

126
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,230
Then, what is that thrown on top of the bed?

127
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:30,789
Isn’t that yours, Jang Man?

128
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,220
There is nothing I left behind.

129
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:35,294
If you go and check, you will know if there is any or not.

130
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,102
Quickly go change, and come back.

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,840
What did I leave behind?

132
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,652
Jang Man.

133
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,999
My soup doesn't have cream.

134
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,189
Jang Man.

135
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:12,752
Even the organic juice has disappeared, &lt;br&gt; has disappeared.

136
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:15,012
Jang Man.

137
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,234
Like this, without you,

138
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:23,065
I can't do anything at all.

139
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,359
I have become like this.

140
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,971
Why &lt;i&gt;(are you staring)&lt;/i&gt;?

141
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,431
You're really pretty.

142
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:54,072
When you first came here in some strange chador, &lt;br&gt; I didn’t imagine that this would happen.

143
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,291
Wow! I am crazy.

144
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,721
It’s the same for me, too.

145
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,370
Rude Bastard! &lt;br&gt;The King of Fussiness!

146
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:06,058
Oh! I am crazy, why?

147
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,224
Be by my side.

148
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:15,887
Not to Apsala, &lt;br&gt;but I am saying this officially to Jang Man Ok,

149
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,925
The position of my stylist... &lt;br&gt;I would like you to be my stylist, Jang Man.

150
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:29,546
I don’t want to be apart from you! &lt;br&gt;When I am working and also when I am at home.

151
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:36,677
Excuse me, Lee Tae Ik…&lt;br&gt;The stylist… I can’t do that.

152
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:40,768
I registered for classes.

153
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:41,803
What?

154
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:46,084
So that I can learn designing, Kang Hwi-nim &lt;br /&gt;left after enrolling me in classes.

155
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:50,811
So I plan to formally start designing.

156
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,530
This crazy!

157
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:57,599
Won Kang Hwi told me to give it a shot (with you). &lt;br&gt;What?

158
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,322
Register for classes?

159
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,167
Huh? &lt;br&gt;Give a shot at what?

160
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,505
Forget it.

161
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:05,352
You needn’t know!

162
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:10,227
But, Jang Man! &lt;br&gt;Is that institute more important than me now?

163
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,996
That institute?

164
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:14,714
My future is at stake! &lt;br&gt;How can you say something like that?

165
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:18,004
Anyway! &lt;br&gt;You continuously did well as Won Kang Hwi’s stylist.

166
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,502
So why won’t you be my stylist?

167
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,683
Why? Why not? &lt;br&gt; Why not?

168
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh! How could you!

169
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:26,924
Won Kang Hwi even registered for me&lt;br /&gt;to study and he worries about me.

170
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:31,916
Lee Tae Ik, because I won’t be your stylist, &lt;br&gt;you whine like a kid. What are you doing?

171
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,421
What? &lt;br&gt; Kid?

172
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,646
And you!

173
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,220
Why do you call Won Kang Hwi, "Kang Hwi-nim"? &lt;br&gt;But why am I, "Lee Tae Ik"?

174
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,149
Call me also the same!

175
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,797
Huh? Call you what?

176
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,247
Like Wong Kang Hwi!

177
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,515
"Tae Ik-nim."

178
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,248
&lt;i&gt;"Tae Ik-nim"?

179
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:57,676
Yes, Tae Ik-nim!

180
00:12:57,672 --> 00:12:59,012
You know that thing.

181
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,113
When you call Won Kang Hwi…&lt;br&gt; You put your hand together like this.

182
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,355
With your eyes, like this, &lt;br /&gt; say,

183
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,962
"Tae Ik-nim."

184
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,922
What is this? &lt;br&gt;Why are you laughing?

185
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,203
He said, "Tae Ik-nim!" &lt;br&gt;Tae Ik-nim!

186
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,799
What? &lt;br&gt; Is that funny?

187
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:23,685
It’s funny. &lt;br&gt;It isn’t even cake-nim but Tae Ik-nim!

188
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,255
It doesn’t suit you.

189
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,836
Hey! Jang Man! &lt;br&gt;Say it once for me! Really!

190
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:28,975
Ah!

191
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:35,555
Hey.

192
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:39,309
Come here!

193
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,195
Come here!

194
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,094
I'm going to get you!

195
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,550
&lt;i&gt;Tae Ik-nim, Tae Ik- nim. &lt;br&gt; 6 Months Later. &lt;/i&gt;

196
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,386
Jang Man.

197
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:05,937
Hyung-nim. &lt;br&gt;Let go of this!

198
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,650
Hey.

199
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,861
I am a pure and innocent person without a single scandal.

200
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:17,815
It will be problematic if you keep doing this.

201
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,621
Are you going to keep talking like that &lt;br /&gt;and making me feel itchy?

202
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,607
Speak like you usually do.

203
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,977
How can a Hallyu star do that?

204
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,889
Haughtily and chic! &lt;br&gt;Don’t you know?

205
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,389
Forget it. &lt;br&gt; Why are you here in the morning?

206
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:35,823
What do you mean why? &lt;br&gt;Did you forget that we have a schedule for a show?

207
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:41,009
Hyung! Stop torturing the managers &lt;br&gt;and do well on your own, huh?

208
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,645
Hey! &lt;br&gt; Hey, Baek Go Dong.

209
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,911
Miss Jang Man Ok.

210
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,106
Miss Jang Man Ok.

211
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:16,997
- Yes? &lt;br&gt;- Yes.

212
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,069
Take this, please.

213
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:22,759
Can you sign here?

214
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,059
- Thank you! &lt;br&gt; - No problem.

215
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,729
&lt;i&gt; Man Ok, have you been well? &lt;/i&gt;

216
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:48,385
&lt;i&gt; I've been doing well. &lt;/i&gt;

217
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:58,395
&lt;i&gt; Ah! And our Chaton has ascended &lt;br /&gt;to be the most popular cat in this neighborhood. &lt;/i&gt;

218
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,351
&lt;i&gt; The Chaton that is there is also doing well, right? &lt;/i&gt;

219
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,541
&lt;i&gt; How is everybody doing? &lt;br&gt; I want to see everyone so much! &lt;/i&gt;

220
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:11,203
&lt;i&gt; Anyway, Man Ok, don’t be sick. &lt;br&gt; Eat well, too! &lt;/i&gt;

221
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:29,179
Kang Hwi-nim, everyone here is doing well.

222
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:36,841
&lt;i&gt; You heard about Take 2, haven’t you? &lt;br&gt; Go Dong has become really cool.&lt;/i&gt;

223
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:41,376
&lt;i&gt; There is one problem though. &lt;br&gt;Go Dong imitates you too much. &lt;/i&gt;

224
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:44,637
&lt;i&gt; It seems that Lee Tae Ik is having &lt;br&gt;a hard time because of that. &lt;/i&gt;

225
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:48,263
&lt;i&gt; And, Senior Manager Hwang… no, President Hwang&lt;/i&gt;

226
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:50,533
&lt;i&gt; is really busy because of the work at the company. &lt;/i&gt;

227
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:51,621
&lt;i&gt; International Star, Jin Se Ryeong, Developed Feelings On scene, Dating Director Jang Lee Shin! &lt;/i&gt;

228
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:56,558
Who said that she isn’t an international star, &lt;br&gt;she publicizes her movie internationally.

229
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:01,243
Make a positive press release &lt;br&gt;and distribute it to the media.

230
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:01,935
Yes.

231
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:02,882
And Senior Manager Kim.

232
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:03,907
Yes, President.

233
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:08,264
There aren’t many days left for Take 2’s Showcase, &lt;br&gt; prepare it well without any problems.

234
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:09,762
I understand, President.

235
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:12,227
You know that Tae Ik will be absent &lt;br&gt;for some time, don’t you?

236
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:16,027
Yes. I arranged the ticket. &lt;br&gt;2 tickets.

237
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:21,505
Now, let’s make a run for it happily &lt;br&gt;and merrily today again!

238
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,087
- Yes! &lt;br&gt; - Yes.

239
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:24,637
- One. &lt;br&gt; - One.

240
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,690
- Two. &lt;br&gt; - Two.

241
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,554
- One. &lt;br&gt; - One.

242
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:30,573
- Two. &lt;br&gt; - Two.

243
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:36,308
&lt;i&gt; Grandpa, as a result of the increased number&lt;br /&gt; of students at Man Ok Kwan, is really happy these days. &lt;/i&gt;

244
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:40,113
&lt;i&gt; My friend, Han Ga Ryeong, my enemy for life. &lt;/i&gt;

245
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:43,143
&lt;i&gt; All this time, she used to pry into the private &lt;br&gt;lives of stars and write weird articles. &lt;/i&gt;

246
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:47,859
&lt;i&gt; But thanks to my close watch &lt;br&gt;is getting better little by little. &lt;/i&gt;

247
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:52,373
&lt;i&gt; SS Magazine or whatever that she established&lt;br&gt; with her two friends she hangs out with, &lt;/i&gt;

248
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:55,758
&lt;i&gt; I am helping them with exclusive articles on Take 2. &lt;/i&gt;

249
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,524
&lt;i&gt; Thanks to that, she is diligently getting reformed. &lt;/i&gt;

250
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,877
&lt;i&gt; Ah! And I…&lt;/i&gt;

251
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:03,018
I'm leaving, bye!

252
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,566
&lt;i&gt;Subtitles by the Maid of the House 2 team at Viki&lt;br&gt;You too can join us and subtitle your favorite dramas.

253
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:24,764
&lt;i&gt; During the day, I teach kids at the studio. &lt;br&gt; In the afternoon, I go to the institute. &lt;/i&gt;

254
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,328
&lt;i&gt; I am really busy, but… &lt;/i&gt;

255
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,952
&lt;i&gt; I think I am born to hold 2 jobs. &lt;/i&gt;

256
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:35,551
&lt;i&gt; Teaching kids and studying design are all fun. &lt;/i&gt;

257
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:44,245
&lt;i&gt; But, Kang Hwi-nim. &lt;br&gt;Everyone really wants to see you. &lt;/i&gt;

258
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,680
&lt;i&gt; When are you coming back to Korea? &lt;/i&gt;

259
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,558
Young master.

260
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:01,978
You have a guest.

261
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,340
What? &lt;br /&gt;A guest has come, but you aren’t even looking?

262
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,215
Lee Tae Ik.

263
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,563
It's been a while, Won Kang Hwi.

264
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:51,905
Hello.

265
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:59,509
Hello, I am the President of L.J. Entertainment, Lee Jun.

266
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:09,287
Ah, yes! &lt;br&gt;I heard that you are interested in entertainment.

267
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:10,577
You thought well.

268
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,936
Have you heard of Hallyu Fever?

269
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,169
Huh? I brought newly-made clothes!

270
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:26,551
You said your outfit was torn. &lt;br /&gt;But, are you still wearing it?

271
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:29,017
Hyung, your outfit tore?

272
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,830
Give it here.

273
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,757
It looks fine.

274
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:35,347
That’s right.

275
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:39,503
Just… here and here… &lt;br&gt;I don’t like the sewing!

276
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,158
It is fine, why?

277
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,671
Again, you are being fussy for no reason!

278
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:44,882
Forget it.

279
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,968
I am going to change. &lt;br&gt;Stay outside.

280
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,545
See if you don’t do well today!

Man Ok.

350
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,510
I was surprised! You didn’t even say &lt;br /&gt;that you were coming. What happened?

351
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:29,969
So that I could surprise you, &lt;br /&gt;I appeared like this, "Ta da!"

You! &lt;br&gt;Who told you to copy Sir Me!’s fashion?

But I will let it slide since it suits you a bit!

Ah, Hyung-nim! &lt;br&gt;I tell you, you can see well!

364

I missed you, too.

Hey, where do you think you are?

370
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:21,283
Hey, what is this? &lt;br /&gt;I'm meeting her after a long time,&lt;br /&gt; let me say hello!

371
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,872
Just say hello with words.

372
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,908
Don’t even shake hands, Jang Man. You don’t know when he will start getting indecent desires for you again.

373
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:30,053
Indecent desires? &lt;br /&gt;Hey! I am such a pure soul!

374
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:34,595
Man Ok, tell me. &lt;br&gt;Am I more pure or is that Rude Bastard more pure?

375
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,340
Man Ok, even now is not too late.

376
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:42,034
Just come back to me. &lt;br&gt;Am I not slightly better than Lee Tae Ik?

377
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,534
What? Are you nuts?

378
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:47,098
Look, look! &lt;br&gt;Now, he even gets violent!

379
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,781
Man Ok, scold him!

380
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,063
Come here!

381
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,939
- No, I won't. &lt;br&gt; - Oh!

382
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:55,137
You are finally meeting after a long time, &lt;br /&gt;why are you acting like this again?

383
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,904
Ah! I can’t live!

384
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,762
Hey! Hey!

385
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:01,357
Oppa, there is only oppa for Ga Ryeong.

386
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:03,032
Can’t I take a picture with you?

387
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,920
Come quickly!

388
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:13,638
1,2,3.

389
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:18,428
Elder, Full House has changed a lot since &lt;br&gt;the first time you came here, hasn’t it?

390
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:20,351
Yes.

391
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,180
Grandpa, have some wine.

392
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,199
- Thank you, Master Jang! &lt;br&gt; - Yes.

393
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,020
- Here! &lt;br&gt; - Thank you, Elder.

394
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:33,934
&lt;i&gt; Follow me.

395
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:36,126
&lt;i&gt; Follow me! &lt;/i&gt;

396
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,700
How is the food?

397
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,480
It's good! It's good!

398
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:45,474
Enjoy it and have a lot.

399
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:56,849
I don’t know, we may get scolded &lt;br&gt;because just the 2 of us snuck out?

400
00:29:56,853 --> 00:30:00,113
I am going to take a walk with my girl.

401
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:03,213
Who is going to scold me?

402
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:06,646
Now, you say that I am your girl in the open.

403
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:15,931
Doesn’t this place make you think of anything?

404
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:19,087
I'm not sure.

405
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,430
Chaton.

406
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:23,453
Chaton.

407
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:26,311
Idiot!

408
00:30:26,313 --> 00:30:28,143
Idiot?

409
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,870
&lt;i&gt; I'm a girl! &lt;/i&gt;

410
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:37,302
&lt;i&gt; Huh? &lt;/i&gt;

411
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,414
&lt;i&gt; I don't know! &lt;br&gt; You, idiot! &lt;/i&gt;

412
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:40,531
&lt;i&gt;Hey, where are you going?&lt;/i&gt;

413
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,752
&lt;i&gt; I said it is Chaton! &lt;/i&gt;

414
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:45,433
&lt;i&gt; -- Idiot! &lt;br&gt; -- Dummy! &lt;/i&gt;

415
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,536
I remember.

416
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:49,532
That rude boy.

417
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:50,717
That's right.

418
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:54,493
That rude boy and the girl who was looking for Chaton.

419
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:56,525
They met again.

420
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:59,072
Isn’t it completely fascinating?

421
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:02,175
It’s really fascinating.

422
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,711
Put your hand into that hole.

423
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:06,599
Huh?

424
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:10,312
Aren’t you going to look for your cat?

425
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:19,468
Oh?

426
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,870
It's really pretty.

427
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:54,757
Ta Da!

428
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:02,526
Do it once.

429
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:03,542
Huh?

430
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:05,982
What?

431
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,636
"Tae Ik-nim."

432
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:14,448
Do it like this, "Tae Ik-nim." &lt;br&gt; Do it like that.

433
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:17,393
Do it once.

434
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:23,357
Tae Ik-nim.

435
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:31,321
Jang Man Ok!! &lt;br&gt;You use Man for ‘Plenty’ and Ok for ‘House,’ don’t you?

436
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,799
Yes.

437
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:36,516
If you change that exactly into English?

438
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:40,511
Full House.

439
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,750
That's right.

440
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:46,635
We were meant to be like this.

441
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:49,724

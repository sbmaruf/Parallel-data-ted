1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,050
100 is what percent of 80?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,080
These problems tend to kill
people because on some level

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,260
they're kind of simple, they're
just 100 and an 80

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,130
there, and they're asking
what percent.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,530
But then people get confused.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,210
They say, do I divide
the 100 by the 80?

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,080
The 80 by 100?

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,570
Or is it something
else going on?

9
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,630
And you really just have to
think through what the

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,660
language is saying.

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,410
They're saying that this value
right here, this 100, is some

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,480
percentage of 80, and that some
percentage is what we

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,310
have to figure out.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,020
What percent?

15
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,370
So if we multiply 80 by this
what percent, we will get 100.

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,720
So let's view it this way.

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,200
We have 80.

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,510
If we multiply it by something,
let's call this

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,700
something x.

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,900
Let me do that in a
different color.

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,350
If we multiply 80 by
something, we are

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,180
going to get 100.

23
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,960
And we need to figure out
what we need to multiply

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,510
80 by to get 100.

25
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,040
And if we just solve this
equation as it is, we're going

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,920
to get a value for x.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,459
And what we need to do is then
convert it to a percent.

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,540
Another way you could have
viewed this is 100 is what you

29
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,670
get when you multiply
what by 80?

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,750
And then you would have gotten
this number, and then you

31
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,800
could convert it to a percent.

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,540
So this is essentially
the equation and now

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,520
we can solve it.

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
If we divide both sides of this
equation by 80, so you

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,210
divide the left-hand side by
80, the right-hand side

36
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,615
by 80, you get x.

37
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:30,950
x is equal to 100/80.

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,150
They both share a common factor
of 20, so 100 divided

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:44,010
by 20 is 5, and 80 divided
by 20 is 4.

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,180
So in simplest form, x is equal
to 5/4, but I've only

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,210
expressed it as a fraction.

42
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,290
But they want to know
what percent of 80.

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,720
If they just said 100
is what fraction of

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
80, we would be done.

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,570
We could say 100 is 5/4
of 80, and we would

46
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,470
be absolutely correct.

47
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,130
But they want to say
what percent?

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,080
So we have to convert this to
a percent, and the easiest

49
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,570
thing to do is to first convert
it into a decimal, so

50
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,199
let's do that.

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,700
5/4 is literally the same thing
as 5 divided by 4, so

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,560
let's figure out what that is.

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,010
Let me do it in magenta.

54
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,950
So 5 divided by 4.

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,190
You want to have all the
decimals there, so let's put

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,860
some zeroes out here.

57
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,200
4 goes into 5 one time.

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,370
Let me switch up the colors.

59
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,200
1 times 4 is 4.

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,410
You subtract.

61
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,690
You get 5 minus 4 is 1.

62
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,290
Bring down the next zero.

63
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,350
And of course, the decimal is
sitting right here, so we want

64
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,880
to put it right over there.

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,950
So you bring down
the next zero.

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,170
4 goes into 10 two times.

67
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,450
2 times 4 is 8.

68
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,610
You subtract.

69
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,690
10 minus 8 is 2.

70
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,875
Bring down the next zero.

71
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,700
4 goes into 20 five times.

72
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,920
5 times 4 is 20.

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,670
Subtract.

74
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,820
No remainder.

75
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,090
So this is equal to 1.25.

76
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,820
5/4 is the same thing
as 5 divided by 4,

77
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,050
which is equal to 1.25.

78
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:28,220
So far, we could say, 100 is
1.25 times 80, or 1.25 of 80,

79
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,170
you could even say, But we still
haven't expressed it as

80
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,770
a percentage.

81
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,650
This is really just
as a number.

82
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,900
I guess you could call it a
decimal, but it's a whole

83
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,680
number and a decimal.

84
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,750
It would be a mixed number if we
didn't do it as a decimal.

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,670
It's 1 and 1/4, or 1 and 25
hundredths, however you want

86
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,580
to read it.

87
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,500
So to write it as a percent,
you literally just have to

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,450
multiply this times 100, or
shift the decimal over twice.

89
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,530
So this is going to be equal to,
as a percent, if you just

90
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:11,930
shift the decimal over twice,
this is equal to 125%.

91
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,980
And that makes complete sense.

92
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,470
100 is 125% of 80.

93
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,890
80 is 100% of 80.

94
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,779
100% percent is more than 80.

95
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,660
It's actually 1 and 1/4 of 80,
and you see that right over

96
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,510
there, so it makes sense.

97
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,470
It's 125%.

98
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,810
It's more than 100%.

99
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,740
But we are done.

100
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,950
We've solved the problem.

101
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,850
It is a 125% of 80.

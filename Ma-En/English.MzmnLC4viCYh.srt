1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,307
Find the perimeter
of the parallelogram.

3
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:05,140
And we have a parallelogram
right over here.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,230
Opposite sides are parallel.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,500
That side is parallel to
that side right over here.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,830
This side is parallel
to that side over here.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,760
And also in a parallelogram,
opposite sides

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,990
have the same length.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,600
Now, we have to worry about
the perimeter here, which

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,290
essentially just says that
if we had a field the size

11
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,930
or the shape of
this parallelogram,

12
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,010
and we wanted to make a
fence around the field that

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,230
was the shape of this
parallelogram, how long would

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,670
that fence have to be?

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,200
And obviously, it
would be the sum

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,040
of the lengths of the sides.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,510
So we wouldn't
even have to worry

18
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,770
about this thing
right over here.

19
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,770
We could ignore it for
the sake of that problem.

20
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,756
We don't care about
the actual height,

21
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,130
or this altitude
right over here.

22
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,090
We just care about the
lengths of its sides.

23
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,253
So the perimeter of
this parallelogram

24
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:50,560
is going to be 12
inches plus 8 inches

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,787
plus 12 inches plus 8 inches.

26
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:58,530

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,680
12 plus 8 is 20.

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,910
12 plus 8 is 20.

29
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,850
So this is all going
to add up to 40 inches.

30
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,990
And we're done.

31
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,570
I guess this is a
very small field,

32
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,970
because it's only 8 inches.

33
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,530
I guess it would be a
little plot of land,

34
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,600
a little parallelogram
plot of land.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,660
Anyway, we're done.

36
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,370
Its perimeter is 40 inches.

00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,640
Welcome to the presentation on level four division.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,540
So what makes level four division harder than level three division

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,582
is instead of having a one-digit number being divided into a multi-digit number,

4
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:17,838
we're now going to have a two-digit number divided into a multi-digit number.

5
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:21,540
So let's get started with some practice problems.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,118
So let's start with what I would say is a relatively straightforward example.

7
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:27,318
The level four problems you'll see

8
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,300
are actually a little harder than this.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:40,320
But let's say I had twenty-five goes into six thousand two hundred fifty.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,660
So the best way to think about this is you say, okay, I have twenty-five.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,520
Does twenty-five go into six?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,300
Well, no.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,900
Clearly six is smaller than twenty-five, so twenty-five does not go into six.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,744
So then ask yourself well, then if twenty-five doesn't go into six,

15
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:58,990
does twenty-five go into sixty-two?

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,740
Well, sure.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,940
Sixty-two is larger than twenty-five, so twenty-five will go into sixty-two.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,230
Well, let's think about it.

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,370
Twenty-five times one is twenty-five.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,800
Twenty-five times two is fifty.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,180
So it goes into sixty-two at least two times.

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,700
And twenty-five times three is seventy-five.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,900
So that's too much.

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,300
So twenty-five goes into sixty-two two times.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,020
And there's really no mechanical way to go about figuring this out.

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,508
You have to kind of think about,

27
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:28,375
okay, how many times do I think twenty-five will go into sixty-two?

28
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,440
And sometimes you get it wrong.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,560
Sometimes you'll put a number here.

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,949
Say if I didn't know, I would've put a three up here

31
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,484
and then I would've said three times twenty-five

32
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,930
and I would've gotten a seventy-five here.

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,486
And then that would have been too large of a number,

34
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,840
so I would have gone back and changed it to a two.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,808
Likewise, if I had done a one and I had done one times twenty-five,

36
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,703
when I subtracted it out,

37
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:48,290
the difference I would've gotten would be larger than twenty-five.

38
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,150
And then I would know that, okay, one is too small.

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,970
I have to increase it to two.

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,490
I hope I didn't confuse you too much.

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,445
I just want you to know that you shouldn't get nervous if you're like,

42
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:59,612
boy, you know every time I go through the step it's kind of like--

43
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:01,170
I kind of have to guess what the number is

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,800
as opposed to kind of a method.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,540
And that's true. Everyone has to do that.

46
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,650
So anyway, so twenty-five goes into sixty-two two times.

47
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,480
Now let's multiply two times twenty-five.

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,840
Well, two times five is ten.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,740
And then two times two plus one is five.

50
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,860
And we know that twenty-five times two is fifty anyway.

51
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,020
Then we subtract.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,970
Two minus zero is two.

53
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,630
Six minus five is one.

54
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:31,101
And now we bring down the five.

55
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,220
So the rest of the mechanics

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,540
are pretty much just like a level three division problem.

57
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,250
Now we ask ourselves, how many times does twenty-five go into one hundred twenty-five?

58
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,720
Well, the way I think about it is, twenty-five--

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,288
it goes into one hundred about four times--

60
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:47,855
so it will go into one hundred twenty-five one more time.

61
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,560
It goes into it five times.

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,096
If you weren't sure you could try four

63
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:53,110
and then you would see that you would have too much left over.

64
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,540
Or if you tried six you would see that you would actually get--

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,805
six times twenty-five is a number larger than one hundred twenty-five.

66
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,380
So you can't use six.

67
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,212
So if we say twenty-five goes into one hundred twenty-five five times,

68
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:13,608
then we just multiply five times five is twenty-five.

69
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:17,138
Five times two is ten plus two.

70
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,376
One hundred twenty five.

71
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,400
So it goes in exact.

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,414
So one hundred twenty-five minus one hundred twenty-five is clearly zero.

73
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,150
Then we bring down this zero.

74
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,270
And twenty-five goes into zero zero times.

75
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,430
Zero times twenty-five is zero.

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,990
Remainder is zero.

77
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:39,500
So we see that twenty-five goes into six thousand two hundred fifty exactly two hundred fifty times.

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,998
Let's do another problem.

79
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:50,820
Let's say I had-- let me pick an interesting number.

80
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,232
Let's say I had fifteen,

81
00:03:55,232 --> 00:04:05,710
and I want to know how many times it goes into two thousand two hundred sixty-five.

82
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,330
Well, we just do the same thing we did before.

83
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,780
We say okay, does fifteen go into two?

84
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,710
No.

85
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,910
So, does fifteen go into twenty-two?

86
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,430
Sure.

87
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,250
Fifteen goes into twenty-two one time.

88
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,220
Notice we wrote the one above the twenty-two.

89
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,800
If it go had gone into two we would've written the one here.

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,260
But fifteen goes into twenty-two one time.

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,984
One times fifteen is fifteen. Right?

92
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:33,378
Twenty-two minus fifteen-- we could do the whole carrying thing-- one, twelve.

93
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:36,392
Twelve minus five is seven.

94
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,158
One minus one is zero.

95
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,443
Twenty-two minus fifteen is seven.

96
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:43,190
Bring down the six.

97
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,980
Okay, now how many times does fifteen go into seventy-six?

98
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,330
Once again, there isn't a real easy mechanical way to do it.

99
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,210
You can kind of eyeball it and estimate.

100
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,530
Well, fifteen times two is thirty.

101
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,490
Fifteen times four is sixty.

102
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,510
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.

103
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:08,469
That's pretty close, so let's say fifteen goes into seventy-six five times.

104
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:12,118
So five times five once again, I already figured it out in my head,

105
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:13,760
but I'll just do it again.

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
Five times one is five.

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,920
Plus seven.

108
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,740
Oh, sorry.

109
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,825
Five times five is twenty-five.

110
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,620
Five times one is five.

111
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,994
Plus two is seven.

112
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,030
Now we just subtract.

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,640
Seventy-six minus seventy-five is clearly one.

114
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,770
Bring down that five.

115
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,090
Well, fifteen goes into fifteen exactly one time.

116
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,684
One times fifteen is fifteen.

117
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:50,338
Subtract it and we get a remainder of zero.

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,410
So fifteen goes into two thousand two hundred sixty-five exactly one hundred fifty-one times.

119
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,647
So just think about what we're doing here

120
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:04,100
and why it's a little bit harder than when you have a one-digit number here.

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,550
Is that you have to kind of think about,

122
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,580
well, how many times does this two-digit number go into this larger number?

123
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,926
And since you don't know two-digit multiplication tables-- very few people do--

124
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:16,416
you have to do a little bit of guesswork.

125
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,992
Sometimes you can look at this first digit

126
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:20,600
and look at the first digit here and make an estimate.

127
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
But sometimes it's trial and error.

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,575
You'll try and when you multiply it out,

129
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,510
you might get it wrong on the first try.

130
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,875
Let's do another problem.

131
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,262
And actually, I'm going to pick numbers at random,

132
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:31,020
so it might not have an easy remainder.

133
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,300
But I think you'll get the point.

134
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,738
I won't teach you decimals now,

135
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:36,590
so I'll just leave the remainder if there is one.

136
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:49,580
Let's say I had sixty-seven going into five thousand nine hundred seventy-eight.

137
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,651
So I just picked these numbers randomly out of my head,

138
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:56,513
so I'll show you that I also sometimes have to do a little bit of guesswork

139
00:06:56,513 --> 00:07:00,326
to figure out how many times one of these two-digit numbers go into a larger number.

140
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:03,560
So sixty-seven goes into five zero times.

141
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,620
Sixty-seven goes into fifty-nine zero times.

142
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:13,440
Sixty-seven goes into five hundred ninety-seven-- so let's see.

143
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,880
Sixty-seven is almost seventy and five hundred ninety-seven is almost six hundred.

144
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,681
So if it was seventy goes into-- seventy times nine is six hundred thirty. Right?

145
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,820
Because seven times nine is sixty-three.

146
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,110
So I'm going to just eyeball approximate.

147
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,060
I'm going to say that it goes into it eight times.

148
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,765
I might be wrong.

149
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,226
And you can always check,

150
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,930
but well, we're going to actually check in this step essentially.

151
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,082
Eight times seven-- well that's fifty-six.

152
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:51,251
And then eight times six is forty-eight.

153
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:57,377
Plus two is fifty-three.

154
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,315
Seven minus six is one.

155
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,740
Nine minus three is six.

156
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,560
Five minus five is zero.

157
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,650
Sixty-one.

158
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,908
So, good. I got it right.

159
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:12,040
Because if I got a number here that was larger than-- that was sixty-seven or larger,

160
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:15,050
then that means that this number up here wasn't large enough.

161
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,401
But here, I got a number that's positive,

162
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,530
because five hundred thirty-six is less than five hundred ninety-seven.

163
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,070
And it's less than sixty-seven, so I did that step right.

164
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,250
So, now we bring down this eight.

165
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,760
Now this one might be a little bit trickier this time.

166
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,500
Once again, we have almost seventy and here we have almost six hundred thirty.

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,990
So maybe it will go into it nine times.

168
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,225
Well, let's give it a try and see if it does.

169
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:49,318
Nine times seven is sixty-three.

170
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:51,709
Nine times six is fifty-four.

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,870
Plus six is sixty.

172
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,700
Good!

173
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,210
So it did actually go into it nine times

174
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,480
because six hundred three is less than six hundred eighteen.

175
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,730
Eight minus three is five.

176
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,580
One minus zero is one.

177
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,662
And six minus six is zero.

178
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:13,434
We have a remainder of fifteen, which is smaller than sixty-seven.

179
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,158
So I'm not going to teach you decimals right now,

180
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:16,970
so we can just leave that remainder.

181
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,690
So what we could say is that sixty-seven goes into five thousand nine hundred seventy-eight eighty-nine times.

182
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,488
And when it goes into it eighty-nine times,

183
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:28,670
you're left with a remainder of fifteen.

184
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,558
Hopefully you're ready now to try some level four division problems.

185
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,130
Have fun!

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,695
I've done a bunch of videos now
on inflation and deflation

3
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:07,580
and how they can be impacted
by capacity utilization.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,230
And the traditional notion of
capacity utilization, and this

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,380
is what my brain does when
someone mentions it, is I

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,140
think of industrial capacity
utilization.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,670
I imagine factories.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,620
And when people say low
utilization, I imagine idle

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,770
factories, and when high
utilization, I imagine

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,200
factories that are running at
three shifts and things are

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,120
moving feverishly.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,340
But in a service-based economy
like we have here in the U.S.

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,880
and like we have in a lot of
Western societies, most of our

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,980
real capacity for what we
produce, or our GDP, is

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,030
service based, because we're
a service-based economy.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,250
And if you think about it,
industrial capacity

17
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,950
utilization, it matters, but
it matters much more to

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,820
manufacturing-based economy.

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,870
In a service-based economy,
the best measure of

20
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,860
utilization really
is unemployment.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,870
And I guess we could say
the best measure of

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,570
underutilization is
unemployment.

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,290
With that said, I think it's
really important to have a

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,200
deeper understanding of how
unemployment is measured and

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,540
how it's thought about from
the Government, and the

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,820
numbers you hear on CNN, what
they really mean in terms of

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,310
the real unemployment picture.

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,230
And most of these charts,
actually all of these charts

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,040
that I have in this video, I
got from Mike Shedlock, who

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,190
runs the Global Economic
Analysis blog.

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,440
And I had a conversation with
him on Friday and he pointed

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,110
out some really interesting
things.

33
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,760
That's what I really want to
cover, and I think it'll give

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,330
us a good general view of
unemployment and give us some

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,640
clues as to what's going
on right now.

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,330
But I encourage you
to read his blog.

37
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,450
He goes by Mish, and he tells
people that the best way to

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,020
find his blog is to just do a
search on Google for Mish.

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,750
And he does a lot of this, where
he looks at the economic

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,520
data, but he goes several levels
deeper than anyone

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,660
really would go, especially
on TV.

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,290
But that's what you really have
to do to really discern

43
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,610
what matters.

44
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,550
And I want to give him full
credit because he really is

45
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,810
who pointed out a lot of this
to me, but I think it's very

46
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,120
instructive to the capacity
utilization and

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,820
inflation-deflation argument
that I've been making.

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,230
So right here I have a
screenshot from the Bureau Of

49
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,509
Labor Statistics and you
could go there, just do

50
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,889
a search for them.

51
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,350
And what most people don't
realize is, just like on the

52
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,090
money supply, you have different
measures of money

53
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,430
supply, you also have different
measures of

54
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,450
unemployment.

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,940
And the number that you hear
reported, at least since 1994,

56
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,790
is U-3, and that's where
we'll start.

57
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,400
That's kind of the official
rate of unemployment.

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,570
I know you can't read
this properly.

59
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,160
My screen capture software
doesn't do

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,390
well with this font.

61
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,800
But U-3 is total unemployed as
a percent of the civilian

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,340
labor force.

63
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,750
So it's very important to
realize what they consider

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,410
unemployed and what they
consider the labor force.

65
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,820
They consider you unemployed
if you don't have a job and

66
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:56,790
you have looked for work
in the past four weeks.

67
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,390
And this is a really
important point.

68
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,000
It really is important to think
about it relative to

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,550
everything else I'll go
over in this video.

70
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,820
Because we've probably had times
in our life where we

71
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,830
considered ourselves unemployed
or we considered

72
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,380
someone else unemployed, but
they had maybe gotten dejected

73
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,540
and stopped looking
a little bit or

74
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,810
decided to take a break.

75
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,930
It's important to realize, in
the numbers that we hear from

76
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,930
the Government, they don't count
as part of the civilian

77
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,180
labor force.

78
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,770

79
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,270
Well, let's say, you stop
looking for a job for five

80
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,340
weeks, because you wanted to
take a break and maybe redo

81
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,170
your resume for awhile, so
you're kind of passively

82
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,280
looking for a job.

83
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,790
The Government no longer
considers you part of the

84
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,730
labor force and you're not
included in that number.

85
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,860
They do have broader numbers
that do include that.

86
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,175
And I think that's important,
because we're actually going

87
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,950
to study the difference between
the different numbers.

88
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,320
U-4 is total unemployed.

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,300
So it's the number up here, plus
discouraged workers, as a

90
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,910
percent of the civilian
labor force,

91
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,420
plus discouraged workers.

92
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,980
So they're going to add
the discouraged

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,230
workers to the numerator.

94
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,020

95
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,920
Let me do this in a
different color.

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,590
Before you had-- this
is the standard one.

97
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,310
You have unemployed over
employed plus unemployed, as

98
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,280
defined-- and when we say
unemployed, it's someone who

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,620
doesn't have a job, but you've
looked for a job in the last

100
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,540
four weeks.

101
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,810
U-4 is now-- let me do it
in a different color.

102
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,490

103
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,290
It is unemployed plus
discouraged over employed plus

104
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,730
unemployed plus discouraged
workers.

105
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,100
And their definition of
discouraged workers-- I just

106
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,880
talked about people who haven't
looked or actively

107
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,340
looked for a job in more than
five weeks or actually more

108
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,390
than four weeks.

109
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,200
You're considered discouraged if
you give a reason for that,

110
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,800
and you say, well, I just
haven't looked for it, because

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,900
I'm discouraged, because I don't
think there are jobs for

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,130
what I want to do anymore, so
that's the reason why haven't

113
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,830
looked for it.

114
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,540
And that's when you get included
into this bucket.

115
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,310
And then U-5 is that same thing,
but what they do is

116
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,890
they add other marginally
attached workers.

117
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,640
And the difference between a
discouraged worker and a

118
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,450
marginally attached worker, a
discouraged worker gives the

119
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,380
economic reason.

120
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,230
They say I haven't looked for
a job in the past five weeks

121
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,310
because I just think
it's impossible.

122
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,090
I want to work but it's just
impossible find a job as an

123
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,460
accountant or an engineer
anymore.

124
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,070
While a marginally attached
worker also says I haven't

125
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,570
looked for a job in the last
five weeks, but they don't say

126
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,150
it's because they think the
economy is making it

127
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,800
impossible.

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,570
It could just be that they're--
I don't know--

129
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,390
depressed generally or they
don't want to-- it could be a

130
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,180
whole set of reasons.

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,860
The important thing is that on
the survey that the Bureau Of

132
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,570
Labor Statistics conducts, that
they don't literally give

133
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,440
that argument that the only
reason that they're not

134
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
looking for it is economic
reasons, and then they'll be

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,300
put into the marginally
attached

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,580
workers and that's U-5.

137
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,810
And then U-6 is really
interesting because it

138
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,040
includes all of these
above, but it

139
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,160
actually shifts some people.

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
So in U-5 you would add
marginally attached to the

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,256
denominator there.

142
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:07,800
In U-6 what you do is you have
total unemployed plus all

143
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,510
marginally attached workers plus
total employed part-time

144
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,570
for economic reasons as a
percent of the civilian labor

145
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,810
force, plus all marginally
attached workers.

146
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,970
So the important thing here
is, plus total employed

147
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,330
part-time for economic
reasons.

148
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,390
That's key, so the denominator
doesn't change anymore, but

149
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,750
this unemployed number is
going to get bigger.

150
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,760
Because there's some part of
the employed population who

151
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,840
are not working 40 hours a week,
or they're not working

152
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,230
as much as they want to work,
or they're not maybe working

153
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,690
in even the field they
want to work.

154
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,960
Maybe instead of working as an
engineer, they're working 20

155
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,340
hours a week at the local
bookstore or at Starbuck's,

156
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,880
and these people are
included in U-6.

157
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,520
And the reason why I want to
really highlight that, and

158
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,260
Mish pointed this out to me,
is that this is increasing

159
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,470
much faster than this.

160
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,400
And we'll think a little bit
about why that's happening and

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,720
what conclusions we can take.

162
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,660

163
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,040
These are the numbers straight
from the Bureau Of Labor

164
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,160
Statistics.

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,890
I know this screen right here is
really hard to see, but if

166
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:16,680
you look at March 2008, the U-3
number was 5.2% and the

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,030
U-6 was 9.3%.

168
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,090
So the difference between
the two is about 4.1%.

169
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,350
But if you go to the most recent
month, the standard

170
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,680
unemployment number is 8.5%,
but the U-6, the one that

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,590
includes the discouraged
workers, the marginally

172
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,160
attached workers and the people
who aren't working full

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,300
time for economic reasons, the
difference is now 7.1%, so

174
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,370
that spread.

175
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,260
People who would like to work,
but they've either stopped

176
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,370
looking because they've gotten
dejected, or they've just

177
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,840
bitten the bullet and taken
a job that they otherwise

178
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,140
wouldn't want to take or taken
fewer hours than they

179
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,630
otherwise wouldn't want to
take, that's growing.

180
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,160
That really is.

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,440
And the reason why we really
want to focus on that is

182
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,290
because it tells us that even
though the unemployment rate,

183
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,500
the official unemployment rate--
that is increasing very

184
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,560
steeply and I'll show a graph
right here, this is actually

185
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,430
work Mish did, where he actually
shows that the spread

186
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,850
between U-6 and U-3 has been
increasing, and it's been

187
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,210
increasing at an accelerating
rate since last February.

188
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,870
That's actually shown right
here in this graph.

189
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,367
And he got this from his
friend Chris Puplava at

190
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,620
Financial Sense, so I want to
give him credit for it.

191
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,919
But you see here, U-6, this
is the broad measure of

192
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,650
unemployment that we talked
about right here.

193
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,100
That's increasing at an even
faster rate than the standard

194
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,250
unemployment measure.

195
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,140
And this green line right here,
this is actually the

196
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,260
difference between the two.

197
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,190
What's interesting about that
is this is kind of measuring

198
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,890
the percentage of the labor pool
that's getting dejected,

199
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,140
that's getting depressed.

200
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,450

201
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,210
So they're either getting
depressed or dejected and not

202
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,670
looking for work, or they're
just saying, you know what?

203
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,310
I can't get a job 40 hours a
week anymore as an accountant.

204
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,220
I will now go work part-time at
the local department store

205
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,470
or do whatever it takes to put
some food on the table for

206
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,850
their families.

207
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,400
In general, it shows the
level of desperation.

208
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,960
And if you look here, and this
is really interesting.

209
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,420
This is also from
Chris Puplava.

210
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,040

211
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,605
If you look relative to the
path, the last major recession

212
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,850
that a lot of people talk about
is the early 80's, the

213
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,970
double dip recession, and
even though the headline

214
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,680
unemployment rate-- let me
make sure I get the right

215
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,590
color-- the headline
unemployment rate here is the

216
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,530
blue line, that is still
a good bit below.

217
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,160
We peaked out there, and I
don't know what the exact

218
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,370
number is, but it looks like
about in the mid 10%.

219
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,120
Even though we're a lot lower
than that now, we're at 8.2%

220
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,960
right now, if you look at U-6,
which is the broadest,

221
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,210
that's spiked up.

222
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,080

223
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,970
Unfortunately, the data
for U-6 doesn't

224
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,990
go back before 1994.

225
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,880
They actually changed how a lot
of things were measured.

226
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,020
The official headline rate,
instead of calling it U-3, it

227
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,800
used to be called U-5, but it
was, for the most part, the

228
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,770
same measure, but that's
changed a little bit.

229
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,840
But U-6 did not exist before
1994 so, unfortunately, we

230
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,810
can't measure U-6 back then.

231
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,910
But a good, I guess,
pseudo-indicator for U-6 that

232
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,850
we do have more historical
data on is the number of

233
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,110
unemployed for more
than 15 weeks.

234
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,830
These are people who have been
looking for work, but 15 weeks

235
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,750
or more, they still haven't
found a job even though

236
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,610
they've been actively
looking for work.

237
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,290
And that, if you look at least
while we have U-6 being

238
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,390
measured, it has tracked that
broad measure quite well.

239
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,670
So if we can make the assumption
that U-6 is always

240
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,150
on that line or above it as it's
graphed here, which it is

241
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:59,070
so far, then U-6 in the early
80's was probably right around

242
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,860
where that line is now.

243
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,140
Maybe it was a little higher,
maybe it was up here.

244
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,140
But what this graph really
does convey is that that

245
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,530
broadest measure of unemployment
is already as bad

246
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,840
as it probably was in
the early 80's.

247
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,530
It's just that we don't
have that data there.

248
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,000
And if anything, those part-time
workers, because

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,430
they are employed, so in the
official unemployment measure,

250
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,230
they're actually making
the number look

251
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,130
a little bit better.

252
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,000
Here you had fewer people.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,810
You were either employed
or you were unemployed.

254
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,160
If you're unemployed, you
made the number look

255
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,180
a little bit bigger.

256
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,490
Here you have a lot more
people who are kind of

257
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,510
in-between, but they
get counted in

258
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,310
the employed number.

259
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,440
So they're making the actual
reported official unemployment

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,420
rate a little bit lower
than is actually

261
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,940
the economic reality.

262
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,430
I think that's a really
important thing to realize

263
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,430
that you have this accelerating
rate of

264
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,880
desperation out there in the
economy and, if anything, it's

265
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,560
telling us that things are
getting worse, and it's

266
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,460
telling us that things are
probably as bad as they've

267
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,140
been in some of the worst
recessions in history and

268
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,890
they're only getting worse.

269
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,900
And going back to where we
started this video, in terms

270
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,660
of capacity utilization and what
that might do to prices,

271
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:13,100
this tells us that labor
utilization is

272
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,130
low and going down.

273
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,480
What that tells us, is
that the price of

274
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,280
labor is going down.

275
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,800
And you've probably read
multiple news reports already

276
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,120
about how this is the first
time furloughs are big.

277
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,710
People are actually
taking wage cuts.

278
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,250
So you're already seeing
deflation in wages.

279
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,210
And when so much of our economy,
and even the basket

280
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,920
of goods in the CPI-- and I'll
do another video on that --is

281
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,780
service based, if you're seeing
deflation in wages,

282
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,140
that's another data point that
tells you, at least in the

283
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,340
medium term, we're probably
going to see further deflation

284
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,280
in prices as a whole.

285
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,100
See you in the next video.

286
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,300

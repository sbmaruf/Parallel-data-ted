1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,940
In its most popular sense,
when people talk about

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,310
mitosis, they're referring to
a cell, a diploid cell.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,670
So diploid just means it has
its full complement of

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,780
chromosomes, so it has
2N chromosomes.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,950
So that's the nucleus.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,410
This is the whole cell.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,960
And so most people are saying,
look, the cell itself

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,590
replicates into two diploid
cells, so it turns into two

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,710
cells, each that have a full
complement of chromosomes, 2N

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,640
chromosomes.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,400
And so when people say a cell
has experienced mitosis, they

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,580
normally mean this.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,850
But I want to make one slight
clarification, that formally,

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,120
mitosis only refers to the
process of the replication of

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,350
the genetic material
and the nucleus.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,180
So, for example, if I were to
draw this-- let me draw the

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,300
cell-- and it has now two
nucleuses, each with the

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,770
diploid number of chromosomes,
this cell

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,040
has experienced mitosis.

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,030
It has not experienced
cytokinesis, which we will

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,730
talk about in a few moments, but
that's the process of the

22
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,430
actual cytoplasm of the
cell being split into

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,490
two different cells.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,160
And just as a clarity, the
cytoplasm is all the stuff

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,630
outside of the nucleus.

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,590
So I'll talk about that in a
second, but just know in

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,680
everyday usage, this is normally
the case when people

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,670
talk about mitosis.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,860
But if you've got a teacher
that likes to get you on a

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,730
technicality, this is
technically what mitosis is.

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,030
It's the splitting of the
nucleus or the replication of

32
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,460
the nucleus into two
separate nucleuses.

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,820
That's normally accompanied
by cytokinesis where the

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,930
cytoplasms of the cells
actually separate.

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,250
Now, with that said, let's go
into the mechanics of mitosis.

36
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,150
So the first steps that are
really necessary for mitosis

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,920
actually occur outside of
mitosis when the cell is just

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,883
doing its day-to-day life, and
that's during the interphase.

39
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,449
And the interphase, literally
it's not a phase of mitosis.

40
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:14,810
It's literally when the
cell is just living.

41
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,730
Let's say we have
some new cell.

42
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,460
Let me do it in green.

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,430
That's a new cell here.

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,780
Maybe this is its nucleus.

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,630
It's got 2N chromosomes,
and then it grows.

46
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,790
It brings in nutrients from
the outside and builds

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,660
proteins and does whatever,
and so it grows a bit.

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,610
It's obviously got its full
chromosomal complement still.

49
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,080
And then at some point during
this life cycle, and I'll

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,220
label these actually, so this
phase in interphase, and this

51
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,460
might not even be covered in
some biology classes, but they

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,070
give it a label.

53
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,650
They call it G1, which
is really just

54
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,380
when the cell is growing.

55
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,840
It's just growing, accumulating
materials and

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,990
building itself out, and then
it actually replicates its

57
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,770
chromosomes.

58
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,760
So you still have a diploid
number of chromosomes.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,390
So let me zoom in.

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,160
So let me draw this.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,490
This is called the S phase of
interphase, so this is S.

62
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,190
And S is where you have
replication of the actual

63
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,430
chromosomes.

64
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,340
Once again, we're not
even in mitosis yet.

65
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,910
So S, you have replication
of your chromosomes.

66
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,770
So if I were to zoom in on the
nucleus during the S phase, if

67
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,230
I were to start off-- let me
just start with some organism

68
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,940
that has two chromosomes.

69
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,210
So let's say that at the
beginning of S phase, and I'll

70
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,060
draw things as chromosomes just
to make it clear that

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,300
things are being replicated.

72
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,010
So let me say it has this
chromosome right here and then

73
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,400
let's say it has this chromosome
right here.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,180
As it goes through S phase,
these chromosomes replicate.

75
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,430
And I'm just drawing
the nucleus here.

76
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,740
I've zoomed in on just this part
right here, where N is 1,

77
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,050
where our full diploid
complement is two chomosomes.

78
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:16,010
During S phase, our chromosomes
will replicate and

79
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,269
will have-- so that green one
will completely replicate and

80
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,220
generate a copy of itself, and
we've learned this a little

81
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,380
bit, they're connected
at the centromere.

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,360
Now, each of those copies are
called chromatids, and that

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,350
magenta one will do
the same thing.

84
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,260
Even though we have two
chromatids, one for each

85
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,170
chromosome, now we have four
chromatids, two for each

86
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,120
chromosome, we still say we
only have two chromosomes.

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,000
That's its centromere
right there.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,410
This occurs in the S phase, and
then the cell will just

89
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,710
continue to grow more.

90
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,160
So the cell was already big--
I'll focus on the cell again.

91
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,720
The cell was already big
and it gets bigger.

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,930
It gets bigger, and that's
during the G2 phase, so it's

93
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,380
just growing more.

94
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,400
Now, there's another little part
of the cell we haven't

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
even talked about yet,
but I'll talk

96
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,800
about it a little bit.

97
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,580
It's not super-duper important,
but it's the idea

98
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,010
of these centrosomes.

99
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,530
These are going to be very
important later on when the

100
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,170
cell is actually dividing,
and those also duplicate.

101
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,270
So let's say I have a little
centrosome here.

102
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,940
It has centrioles inside it.

103
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,820
You don't have to worry too much
about that, but they're

104
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,370
these little cylindrical-looking
things.

105
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,560
But I just want to-- so you
don't get confused if you see

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,710
the word centriole and
centrosomes, not to be

107
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,690
confused with centromeres, which
are these little points

108
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,760
where the two chromatids
attach.

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,640
Unfortunately, they named many
things in this process very

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,520
similarly, or a lot
of the parts

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,590
of a cell very similarly.

112
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,320
But you have these things called
centrosomes that are

113
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,720
going to enter the picture very
soon, that are sitting

114
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,260
outside of the nucleus, and
they also replicate.

115
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,280
They also replicate during
the interphase.

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,100
So you had one before, now
you have two of them.

117
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,530
And, of course, they each have
their two little centrioles

118
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,930
inside, but we're not going
to focus too much

119
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,020
on those just yet.

120
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,460
So that's what happened
in the interphase.

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,280
This is most of the cell's life,
and it's kind of growing

122
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,420
and doing what it wants.

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,200
Actually, I'll make a
slight point here.

124
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,310
When I drew the DNA here, I
drew them as chromosomes.

125
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,140
But the reality is when we're
sitting in the interphase,

126
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,760
this is not what the DNA would
actually look like.

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,930
The DNA, if I were to actually
draw this, it's in its

128
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,580
chromatin form.

129
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,670
It's not all tightly wound
like I drew it here.

130
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,050
I drew it tightly wound so that
you can see that it got

131
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,920
replicated, but the reality is
that that green chromosome

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,980
would actually be all unwound,
and if you were looking in a

133
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,330
microscope, you would even
have trouble seeing it.

134
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,470
This is its chromatin form.

135
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,370
We'll talk a little bit about
where it actually organizes

136
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,050
itself back into a chromosome,
but in its chromatin form,

137
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,270
it's just a bunch of DNA and
proteins that the DNA is

138
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,610
wrapped around a little bit,
so you might have some

139
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,990
proteins here that the DNA is
wrapped around a little bit.

140
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,560
But if you're looking at it in
a microscope, it just looks

141
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,210
like a big blur of
DNA and proteins.

142
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,090
Same thing for the
magenta molecule.

143
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,010
Really, for DNA to
do anything, it

144
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,080
has to be like this.

145
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,150
It has to be open to its
environment in order for the

146
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,960
mRNA and the different types of
helper proteins to really

147
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,790
be able to function with it.

148
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,260
And even for it to be able to
replicate, it has to be

149
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,360
unwound like this in order
for it to function.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,600
It only gets tightly wound
like this later on.

151
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,630
I just drew it like this, so
really it had one green one,

152
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,080
and it's going to replicate to
form another green one, and

153
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,010
they're going to be attached
at some point.

154
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,260
That magenta one is going to
replicate to form another

155
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,440
magenta one, and they'll be
attached at some point, but

156
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
it's not going to be clear.

157
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,060
I just drew it this way to show
that it really happened.

158
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,320
This is the reality.

159
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,870
It's in its chromatin form.

160
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,930
Now, we're ready for mitosis.

161
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,060
So the first stage
of mitosis is

162
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,420
essentially-- let me draw this.

163
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,200
So I'll draw the
cell in green.

164
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,790
I'm going to draw the nucleus a
lot bigger than it normally

165
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,470
is relative to the cell just
because, at least right now, a

166
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,820
lot of the action is going
in the nucleus.

167
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,890
So the first stage of mitosis
is the prophase.

168
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,809
These are somewhat arbitrary
names that were assigned.

169
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,890
People looked in a microscope.

170
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,380
Oh, that's a certain type of
step that we always see when a

171
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,100
nucleus is dividing so we'll
call this the prophase.

172
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:55,210
What happens in the prophase is
that the actual chromatin

173
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,050
starts actually turning into
this type of form.

174
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,330
So as I just said, when we're
in the interphase, the DNA's

175
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,750
in this form where it's all
separated and unwound.

176
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,220
It actually starts to wind
together, so this is where

177
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,940
you'll actually have-- and
remember, it's already

178
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,480
replicated.

179
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,990
The replication happened
before mitosis begins.

180
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,840
So I had that one chromosome
there, and then I

181
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,400
have another one here.

182
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,740
It has two sister chromatids
that we'll see

183
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,270
soon get pulled apart.

184
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:30,000
Now, during prophase, you
also start to have these

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,060
centromeres appear that I
was touching on before.

186
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,380
These guys over here, they
start to facilitate the

187
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,060
generation of what you call
microtubules, and you can kind

188
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,770
of view these as these sticks or
these ropes that are going

189
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,890
to be key in moving things
around as we divide the cell.

190
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,160
All of this is pretty amazing.

191
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,630
I mean, you think of a cell, you
think of something that's

192
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,090
inherently pretty simple.

193
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,940
It's the most basic living
structure in us or in life.

194
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,750
But even here, you have these
complex mechanics going on,

195
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,360
and a lot of it still
isn't understood.

196
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,820
I mean, we can observe it, but
we really don't know what's

197
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,140
happening at the atomic level
or at the protein level that

198
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,720
allows these things to move
around in such a nicely

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,760
choreographed way.

200
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,480
It's still an area
of research.

201
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,520
Some of this is understood,
some of it isn't.

202
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,910
But you have these two
centrosomes, and they

203
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,970
facilitate the development of
these microtubules, which are

204
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,740
literally like these little
microstructures.

205
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:40,310
You can view them as tubes
or as some type of rope.

206
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,230
Now as prophase progresses, it
eventually gets to the point

207
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,720
where-- let me do it.

208
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,955
I don't want this word
replication written here.

209
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,030
It makes it confusing.

210
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,950
Let me delete that.

211
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,775
Let me get rid of this
replication.

212
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,690
So as prophase progresses, the
nuclear envelope actually

213
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,430
disappears.

214
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,435
So let me redraw this.

215
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:03,855
Let me copy and paste what
I've done before.

216
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,536
Put it there.

217
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:15,760
So as prophase progresses-- the
nuclear envelope actually

218
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,790
starts to disassemble.

219
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,400
So this starts to actually
dissolve and disassemble, and

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,330
then these things start to grow
and attach themselves to

221
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:29,840
the centromere.

222
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,290
So actually, let me do that.

223
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,230
So this is all during
prophase.

224
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,430
Since all of this happens during
prophase, this latter

225
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,390
part of prophase, sometimes
they'll call it late prophase,

226
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,820
sometimes it'll be called
prometaphase.

227
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,140
Sometimes it's considered-- I
don't think there's a hyphen

228
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,390
really there.

229
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,890
So sometimes it's actually
considered a separate phase of

230
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,700
mitosis, although when I learned
it in school, they

231
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,180
didn't bother with
prometaphase.

232
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,620
They just called it
all prophase.

233
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,620
But by the end of prophase,
or actually by the end of

234
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,220
prometaphase, depending on how
you want to view it, the whole

235
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,510
situation is going to look
something like this.

236
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,390
You have your overall cell.

237
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,460
The nuclear envelope has
disassembled, so to some

238
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,980
degree, it doesn't
exist anymore.

239
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,380
Although the proteins that
formed it are still there and

240
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,350
they're going to be
used later on.

241
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,840
And you have your two
chromosomes in this case.

242
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,800
In a human's case, you would
have 46 of them.

243
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,320
You have your two chomosomes,
each made with sister

244
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,050
chromatids, each made with
two sister chromatids.

245
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,190
Two chromosomes.

246
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,900
They, of course, have their
centromeres right there, and

247
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:55,160
then these centrosomes will
have migrated roughly on

248
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,930
opposite sides of what
was once the nucleus.

249
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,370
And these things have kind
of spread apart, these

250
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,740
microtubules, so they're doing
two functions, really.

251
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,270
At this point, they're
kind of pushing these

252
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,470
two centrosomes apart.

253
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,370
So you have all of these things,
and they're connecting

254
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,880
the-- you know, some of them
are coming from this

255
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,760
centrosome, some are coming from
this centrosome, some are

256
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
connecting the two.

257
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,900
And then some of these
microtubules, these tubes or

258
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,210
these ropes, however you want
to view them, attach

259
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:31,340
themselves to the centromeres of
the actual chromosomes, and

260
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,610
the protein structure that they
attach them to is called

261
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,570
the kinetochore.

262
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,160
So there's the kinetochore
there, and that may or may not

263
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,040
be-- kinetochore.

264
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,430
It's a protein structure.

265
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,940
It's actually fascinating.

266
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,980
It's still an open area of
research on how exactly the

267
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,350
microtubule attaches to the
kinetochore, and as we'll see

268
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,740
in a second, it's at the
kinetochore that the

269
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,400
microtubules essentially start
to pull at the two separate

270
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,670
sister chromatids and actually
pull them apart.

271
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,530
And it's actually
not understood

272
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,720
exactly how that works.

273
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,080
It's just been observed that
this actually happens.

274
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,020
Once prophase is done,
essentially the cells then

275
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,190
just make sure that the
chromosomes are well aligned.

276
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,270
I kind of drew them well aligned
here, but that just

277
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,760
kind of formally occurs
during metaphase,

278
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,090
which is the next phase.

279
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,040
The first one was prophase.

280
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,280
Now we're in metaphase, and
metaphase really is just an

281
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,680
aligning of the chromosomes, so
all of the chromosomes are

282
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,300
going to be aligned at the
center of the cell.

283
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,430
So I have my magenta one here,
I have my magenta one here,

284
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,660
and I have my other one here,
my green one there, and, of

285
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,960
course, you have your
centrosomes, the microspindles

286
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,570
that are coming off of them.

287
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,250
Some of them are kinetochore
microspindles that are

288
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,200
actually attaching to the
centromeres of the actual

289
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,470
chromosomes.

290
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,910
It's very confusing, right?

291
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,850
The centrosomes are these
structures that help direct

292
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,070
what happens to these
microtubules.

293
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,880
Centrioles are these little
structures, these little

294
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,850
can-shaped structures inside
the centrosomes, and the

295
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,050
centromere are the center
points where the two

296
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,170
chromatids attached to each
other within a chromosome.

297
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,850
So this is one sister chromatid,
that's another

298
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,250
sister chromatid, and they
attach at the centromere.

299
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,180
But this is metaphase.

300
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,100
It's fairly easy.

301
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,310
Metaphase, you just have this
aligning of the cells, and

302
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,220
there's actually some theories,
how does the cell

303
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,770
know to progress past
this point?

304
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,740
How does it know
that everything

305
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,240
is aligned and attached?

306
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
And then there are some theories
that there's actually

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,970
some signaling mechanism that
if one of these kinetochore

308
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,110
proteins isn't properly attached
to one of these

309
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,130
ropes, that somehow a signal
is sent that mitosis should

310
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,950
not continue.

311
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,200
So this is a very intricate
process.

312
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,540
You can imagine if you have 46
chromosomes and you have all

313
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,630
of this stuff going on in the
cell, and it's not like

314
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,080
there's some individual
pushing stuff, or some

315
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,800
computer here.

316
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,360
It's really directed
by chemistry and by

317
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,910
thermodynamic processes.

318
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:23,130
But just by the intricacy or
the elegance of how these

319
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,690
things are, it happens
spontaneously with all of the

320
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,780
proper checks and balances, so
that most of the time, nothing

321
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,210
bad happens, which is
all quite amazing.

322
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,270
So after metaphase, now we're
ready to pull the stuff apart,

323
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,520
and that's anaphase.

324
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,760
So in anaphase-- let
me write that down.

325
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,250
I've changed the color
of my cell.

326
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,280
These guys get pulled apart.

327
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,490
And as soon as they get pulled
apart-- so let's see, this

328
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,520
guy's getting pulled.

329
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,150
Let me do it in green.

330
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,540
So one of the sister-- nope,
that's not green.

331
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,410
One of the sister chromatids is
pulling in that direction.

332
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,660
One is getting pulled
in that direction.

333
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,520
And then the same is true
for the magenta ones.

334
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
Pulled in that direction,
and one is getting

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,780
pulled in that direction.

336
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,630
And, of course, you have your
centrosomes here and then

337
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,040
they're connected to the
kinetochores that are right

338
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,119
there and that's where
they're pulling.

339
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,890
There's also a whole microtubule
structure that

340
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,650
isn't connected to the actual
chromosomes, but they're

341
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,260
helping to actually push apart
these two centrosomes so that

342
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,570
everything is going to opposite
sides of the cell.

343
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,960
And so as soon as these two
chromatids are separated, and

344
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,140
I touched on this a little bit
before when we talked about

345
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,120
the vocabulary of DNA, then as
soon as that happens, these

346
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,030
are each referred to
as chromosomes.

347
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,960
So now you can say that
the cell has what it

348
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,750
used to have here.

349
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,770
It has two chromosomes.

350
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,900
It now has four chromosomes.

351
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,210
Because as soon as a chromatid
is no longer connected to its

352
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,590
sister chromatid, they're then
considered sister chromosomes,

353
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,100
which is just a naming
convention.

354
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,740
I mean, they were there before,
they were there after.

355
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,510
They were just attached
before.

356
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,390
Now they're not attached, so
you kind of consider them

357
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,930
their own individual entity.

358
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,590
And then we're almost done.

359
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,960
The last stage is telophase.

360
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,900
I'm going to draw the cell a
little bit different here

361
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,650
because something is happening
simultaneously with telophase

362
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,720
most of the time.

363
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,910
So telophase, and actually I'll

364
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,520
rotate the cell 90 degrees.

365
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,800
Let's say that this was
one centromere.

366
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,930
This is the other centromere.

367
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,640
So at this point,
it's essentially

368
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,670
pulled the DNA to itself.

369
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,000
So this guy has pulled one copy
of that chromosome and

370
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,130
one copy of this chromosome.

371
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,730
That guy's done the
same up here.

372
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,370
He's pulled over one copy of
each-- oh, I used a different

373
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,060
color-- one copy of each
chromosome to himself.

374
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,190
Let me draw that right
there like that.

375
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,200
And now the nuclear membranes
start forming around each of

376
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,980
these two ends.

377
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,660
So now you start having a
nuclear membrane form around

378
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,760
each of these two ends.

379
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,310
And so by the end of the
telophase-- that's what we're

380
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,880
in, the telophase-- we will
have completed mitosis.

381
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,110
We will have completely
replicated our two original

382
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,300
nucleuses and all of the genetic
content inside of it.

383
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,430
Now, at the same time telophase
is happening, you

384
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,440
also normally have this
cytokinesis, where this

385
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,260
cleavage furrow forms, where
essentially-- during

386
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,570
telophase, these things are
getting pushed further and

387
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,720
further apart by those
microtubules so that they're

388
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,166
already at the ends of the cell,
of the cytoplasm of the

389
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,270
cell, and you can almost view
them as pushing on the sides

390
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,860
to elongate the cell.

391
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,440
As that is happening, you have
this furrow forming, this

392
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,310
little indentation.

393
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,520
By the end of telophase in
mitosis, you also have this

394
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,340
process of cytokinesis, where
this cleavage furrow forms and

395
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,900
deepens, deepens, deepens
until the cytoplasm is

396
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,730
actually split into two
separate cells.

397
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,560
So this is cytokinesis, which
is formally not a part of

398
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,450
mitosis, but it normally occurs
with the telophase, so

399
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,950
right at the end of mitosis,
you do normally have two

400
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,770
complete identical cells.

401
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,800
Once you have each of these
two cells, then they, each

402
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,140
individually, enter their
own interphase.

403
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,840
Or they each individually, if
we look at just this one, he

404
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,780
will then be in his G1 phase.

405
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,650
At some point, these two things
are going to replicate,

406
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,500
and that's the S phase, and you
go to the G2 phase, and

407
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,280
then this guy will experience
mitosis all over again.

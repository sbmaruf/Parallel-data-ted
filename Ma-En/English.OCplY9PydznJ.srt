1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,790
We're on problem 71.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,830
It says, what is the value of x in the triangle below?

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,360
OK, so we can just pull out the Pythagorean theorem here.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,533
Although, you might recognize that

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,732
if these two sides are the same,

6
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:16,630
then these two base angles are going to be the same.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,080
And if those base angles are
the same, then this is a... well, if this is 90,

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,045
so then you have 90 degrees to go 
between those two angles,

9
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,110
so they're going to have to be 45.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,360
Because they're the same.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,080
So this is a 45, 45,
90 triangle.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,430
And if you haven't already,
you'll eventually memorize kind of how

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,735
the sides of a 45, 45, 90 relate
to its hypotenuse.

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:36,980
But you don't have
to memorize it.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,710
You can prove it here.

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,480
Sometimes it's just faster
on standardized tests

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,530
and things like that.

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,370
So what does the Pythagorean
theorem tell us?

19
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,600
It tells us that this side
squared, so let's say x squared,

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,660
plus this side squared,
plus x squared is

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,370
equal to the hypotenuse
squared.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,890
Is equal to 10 squared,
which is 100.

23
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,980
So we get 2x squared
is equal to 100.

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,380
x squared is equal to 50.

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,480
OK, Dividing both sides by 2.

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,830
And then what does
this turn into?

27
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:13,270
So we can say x is equal to
the square root of 50.

28
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,140
Is there anything that we can do
here to simplify it at all.

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,060
Let me think.

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,090
Oh sure, 50 is 25 times 2.

31
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,150
So that's equal to the square
root of 25 times the

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,490
square root of 2.

33
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,760
Which is equal to 5 times
the square root of 2.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,210
Choice B.

35
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,910
Problem 72.

36
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,670
What is the value
of x in inches?

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,690
OK, a couple of problems ago, we
saw a 30, 60, 90 triangle,

38
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,770
this is another one.

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,060
30 degrees, 90 degrees, they
have to add up to 180, this

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,310
one is equal to 60 degrees.

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,340
And I did that big convoluted
drawing where I flipped it and

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,790
all of that.

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,950
I think this is a good time to
just to memorize the sides of

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,000
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,360
Because that's something that
one needs to know in life.

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,500
It's surprisingly useful.

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,830
Especially once you start taking
standardized tests or

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,650
do trigonometry.

49
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,440
So I'll just give you
the general rule.

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,350
So let me just draw another
one right here.

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,280
Let's say this is my other
30, 60, 90 triangle.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,800
This is clearly the hypotenuse
up here.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,930
This is, I call it the 30 degree
side, it's opposite the

54
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,420
30 degree angle, or it's
the shortest side.

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,290
So the general rule is, if this
side right here is x.

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,670
Then the hypotenuse
is going to be 2x.

57
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,820
And we saw that in that
previous video.

58
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,700
And then you can actually use
the Pythagorean theorem here

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,400
to solve for this last side.

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,450
You really just need to memorize
that the hypotenuse

61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,760
is twice the shortest side.

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,570
So this case, what's
the shortest side?

63
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,160
It's opposite the
30 degree side.

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,010
So it's 7.

65
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,300
So the hypotenuse would be
twice that, which is 14.

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,990
And you could use the
Pythagorean theorem to

67
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,270
figure out x now.

68
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,140
Or you could just memorize that
the middle side, I guess

69
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,940
you could say, or the long
non-hypotenuse side, or the 60

70
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,660
degree side, the side opposite
the 60 degree angle, that's

71
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,120
equal to the square root of
3 times the short side.

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,900
So in this case, x is the square
root of 3 times 7.

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,910
So x is equal to 7 times
the square root of 3.

74
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,190
And don't take my word for it.

75
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,220
You could take my word for
that this is double that.

76
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,280
And we proved that in a
couple of videos ago.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,690
But you could do the Pythagorean
theorem here.

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,200
You could say that 7 squared,
which is 49 , plus x squared

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,490
is going to be equal to the
hypotenuse squared.

80
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:52,490
14 squared is 196.

81
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,090
Subtract 49 from both sides.

82
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:08,990
You get x squared is equal to
196 minus 50 would be 157, is

83
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,390
that right?

84
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,330
Let me make sure I got it.

85
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,200
14 times 14.

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,370
4 times 4 is 16.

87
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,730
56.

88
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,670
140, right.

89
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,500
196.

90
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,270
And if you were to subtract 49
from that, this is an 8, this

91
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,060
is 16, we have a 7.

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,280
Sorry, 147.

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,530
It's a good thing
I checked that.

94
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,030
147.

95
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,050
All right.

96
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,520
So x is equal to the
square root of 147.

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,490
147 is 49 times 3.

98
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,300
It's equal to the square
root of 49 times 3.

99
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,270
Well that's just equal to the
square root of 49 times the

100
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,720
square root of 3.

101
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,270
Which is equal to 7 root 3.

102
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,510
Which is what we got.

103
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,650
But it might be easier to just
memorize that the side

104
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,660
opposite the 60 degree side, is
going to be the square root

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,380
3 times the short side.

106
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,630
And the short side is going
to be half the hypotenuse.

107
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,190
Anyway, the more practice
you do, the more

108
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,840
it will make sense.

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,860
OK, a square is circumscribed
about a circle.

110
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,320
What is the ratio
of the circle to

111
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,480
the area of the square?

112
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,850
So the square is circumscribed about the circle.

113
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:49,490
Let me draw the circle and the square. Well, if that's my circle, then if I want to draw a square, See if I can, nope that's not what I wanted to do . I wanted to draw a solid square. That's... let me see if I can draw it without pressing the shift key.

114
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,220
Oh, I think that's close enough.

115
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,910
We know the square is on
the outside because

116
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,190
it's about the circle. It's circumscribed about the circle.

117
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,510
What is the ratio of the area
of the circle to the area of

118
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,120
the square?

119
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,270
So let's say this is
the center of the

120
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,940
circle right there.

121
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,112
This is its radius.

122
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,250
Let's call that r.

123
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,910
Well what's the area of the
square going to be?

124
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,540
If that's the radius, this
is also the radius.

125
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,550
So one side of this square up
here, is going to be 2r.

126
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,040
So this side is also
going to be 2r.

127
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,960
It's a square, all the
sides are the same.

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,600
So they want to know the ratio
of the area of the circle to

129
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,850
the area of the square.

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,390
The area of the square
is just 2r times 2r.

131
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,355
Which is 4r squared.

132
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,310
Area of the circle is
just pi r squared.

133
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,530
You hopefully learned the
formula for area of a circle.

134
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,940
Divide the numerator and the
denominator by r squared.

135
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,760
You're left with pi/4.

136
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,060
That's choice D.

137
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,330
Problem 75.

138
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:09,170
In the circle below, AB and CD
are chords intersecting at E.

139
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,950
Fair enough.

140
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:26,620
If AE is equal to 5, BE is
equal to 12, what is

141
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,130
the value of DE?

142
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,380
CE is equal to 6.

143
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,290
What is the value of DE.

144
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,260
Let's call that x.

145
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,950
Now, I'm not going to prove it
here, just for saving time.

146
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,470
But there's a neat property
of chords within a circle.

147
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,970
That if I have two chords
intersecting a circle, it

148
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,970
turns out that the two segments
when you multiply

149
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,720
them times each other, are
always going to be equal to

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,790
the same thing.

151
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,560
So in this case, 5 times 12.

152
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:10,390
So the two segments of chord
AB, so 5 times 12.

153
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,510
That's going to be equal to
these two segments multiplied

154
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,760
by each other.

155
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,290
It's going to be equal
to x times 6.

156
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,900
So you get 60 is equal to 6x.

157
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,350
Divide both sides by 6, you
get x is equal to 10.

158
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,700
And that is choice C.

159
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,530
That might be a fun thing for
you to think about after this

160
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,600
video of why that is.

161
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,720
And maybe you want to play
around with chords and prove

162
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
to yourself that that's
always the case.

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,289
At least that it
makes intuition

164
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,250
for you, makes sense.

165
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,280
RB is tangent to a circle.

166
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,910
Tangent means that it just
touches the outside of the

167
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,810
circle right there at
only one point.

168
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,300
And it's actually perpendicular
to the radius at

169
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,870
that point.

170
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,510
So this is the radius
of that point.

171
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,920
The center is at A.

172
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,100
This is a radius.

173
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,740
And it's tangent at point B, so
it's perpendicular to the

174
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,260
radius at that point.

175
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,240
BD is a diameter,
OK, fair enough.

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,775
Well A is the center, so
that's kind of obvious.

177
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,070
So they want to know what is
the measure of angle CBR.

178
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,040
So they want to know what
this angle is equal to.

179
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
Well, I kind of did
it inadvertently.

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,310
We know that when a line is
tangent to a circle, it's

181
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,900
perpendicular to the radius
at that point.

182
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,790
So this whole angle
is 90 degrees.

183
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,330
So the angle that we're
trying to figure out,

184
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,410
let's call that x.

185
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,030
That's the complement to 25.

186
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,460
x plus 25 is equal to 90.

187
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:56,750
Subtract 25 from both sides.
x is equal to 65 degrees.

188
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,545
And that is choice B.

189
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,770
OK, I'll see you in
the next video.

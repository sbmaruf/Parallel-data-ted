1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,110
Miranda's Maid Service charges
$280 to clean 8 offices.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,190
What is the company's price for
cleaning a single office?

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:22,810
So they charge $280 to
clean 8 offices.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,885
So it's $280 per every
8 offices.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,520
And then we can simplify this.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,070
We could see, well,
are both of them

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,960
divisible by a common factor?

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,510
And this one looks like
it is divisible by 8.

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,050
200 is divisible by
8, and then 80 is

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,140
divisible by 8 as well.

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,770
So let's divide both the
numerator and the

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,470
denominator by 8.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:56,840
And if we do that, 8 goes
into 28 three times.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,130
3 times 8 is 24.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,250
Subtract.

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,800
You have 4 left over.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,140
8 minus 4 is 4.

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,879
Bring down this 0.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,980
8 goes into 40 exactly
five times.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,590
5 times 8 is 40, and you
have no remainder.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,475
So when you divide 280
by 8, you get 35.

22
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:20,170
And if you divide 8
by 8, you get 1.

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,310
So this rate simplifies to, this
price per office, I guess

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:35,460
we could call it, simplifies
to $35 for every 1 office,

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,980
which we could also write as 35
over 1 dollars per office,

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:53,630
which is the exact same thing
as $35 per office.

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,280
And we're done.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,710
That is the company's
price for cleaning a

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,330
single office: $35.

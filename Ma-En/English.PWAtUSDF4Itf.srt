1
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:20,059
I'm only here because your house was the closest.

2
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:24,713
Yi Jung would give me grief because of the fight we had in Macau...

3
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:28,731
And at Woo Bin's place, the girls are too loud...

4
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:30,599
What about the punch I took?

5
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,055
What are you going to do about that?

6
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:38,454
Uh, fine. Hit me.It'll be settled if I let you hit me once.

7
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:42,978
Hurry. Hit me.

8
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,092
What's going on with the engagement?

9
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:50,588
I don't know. How would I be able to predict the machinations of that Old Witch?

10
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:58,855
Engagement, my foot. And of all the girls, where'd she come up with one like her?

11
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:02,074
Did everyone.... return safely?

12
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:07,742
If you're curious about Jan Di, then yes, she made it back safely.

13
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:14,134
Did anyone say I was curious?

14
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:17,716
Hey, it's your friend's birthday and you haven't even given me a present!

15
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:25,787
Hurry up and hand it over.

16
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:51,781
What is this?

17
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,684
Goo Joon Pyo, happy birthday.

18
00:01:55,684 --> 00:02:02,059
I'll be praying that this birthday is not a lonely one, but one filled with happiness.

19
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:36,289
Geum Jan Di

20
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:41,528
- What I said to Joonpyo in Macau...<BR> - I know...

21
00:02:41,528 --> 00:03:25,809
You only said it because you were mad at Goo Joon Pyo.

22
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:36,607
You there! Hey, you, Beef Jerky!

23
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:41,156
I was right. I'm right. The beef jerky girl in Macau, right?

24
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:45,004
Hello. How is it that you're here?

25
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:49,954
Hey. I'm your life saver but you don't seem all that happy to see me.

26
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,531
I'm really happy to see you.

27
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:57,772
I'm happy to see you too, but why are you here?

28
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:02,677
I came to look for someone.

29
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:07,315
- Goo JunPyo?- Oh, how do you know that?

30
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,552
Do you know that jerk?

31
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:16,991
Oh right. Your name is... JanDi. Geum JanDi.

32
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,563
Oh, Geum JanDi. Do you remember my name?

33
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:25,434
Ha JaeKyung.

34
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:28,903
Seeing that you're in a uniform, I take it that you're still a high schooler.

35
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:32,207
Junior? Senior? Senior.

36
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:37,112
I'm going to start attending ShinHwa University. That's great. Shall we be big sister/little sister?

37
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:41,251
Eh?<BR>Oh! You're cute!

38
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:46,691
From the first time I saw you, you really appealed to me, little sister, Jan Di.

39
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:49,791
Little sister JanDi?

40
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,862
Where is that jerk hiding?

41
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:59,134
Oh! Why is that girl here?

42
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:04,872
Oh, I found him!

43
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:09,078
You found what?<BR>What do you mean, "What?"

44
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:14,215
My fiance, of course!You'd better let go!

45
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:17,252
Why? You don't like my greeting?

46
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:25,027
Then would you rather I bite your ear, like last time?

47
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:29,898
What is this crazy monkey saying? Why don't you just buzz off?!

48
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:34,356
I'm only going to say this once, so don't forget it. My name is Ha JaeKyung.

49
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:36,538
From today on, I am your fiancée.

50
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,041
You got it? And keep in mind.

51
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,277
Keep what in mind?

52
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:45,367
From here on, I'm going to tame you.

53
00:05:45,367 --> 00:06:07,135
Bang!

54
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:15,677
From today, Joon Pyo is going to be attending ShinHwa University with us.

55
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,446
So you're okay, then?

56
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:20,348
- About what? <BR>- That girl.

57
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:25,053
That fiancee girl. Doesn't that fiancee bother you when she goes running after Joon Pyo sunbae?

58
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:28,049
What does that have to do with me?

59
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:33,312
And that unni (big sister) . . . Unni?

60
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:36,231
She seems like a cool person.

61
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:40,468
No, she is a cool person.

62
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:45,274
Who? Who's a cool person?

63
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,342
Why are you here?

64
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:52,514
Hi! I'm Ha JaeKyung. Are you JanDi's friend?

65
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:55,583
I'm also a friend of Jan Di. It's nice to meet you.

66
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,354
- Eh? <BR>- Oh, so you work part-time here?

67
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:02,791
It must be fun. I've always wanted to do something like that.

68
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,194
Then do it!

69
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:10,232
Since you are such a universally beautiful woman, you are welcome any time.

70
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:13,868
For now, I'll just borrow my two friends today.

71
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,336
Sorry?

72
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:19,034
Chen, don't think of following me and take care of the things here.

73
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:27,347
JanDi, GaEul, you guys are going to go somewhere without me again, right?

74
00:07:27,347 --> 00:08:16,964
Don't worry about the porridge restaurant and go.

75
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,801
You know, I've really always wanted to do stuff like this:

76
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:27,442
Gossip with my girlfriends and bad-mouth my boyfriend and get advice about dating.

77
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:30,979
You don't have any friends?

78
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:52,033
No, I don't have any friends.

79
00:08:52,033 --> 00:09:11,587
Eat.

80
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:17,039
Since I was young, I traveled so much to places like India, Europe, Africa.

81
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:24,798
I didn't have time to make friends.

82
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:53,495
So, what kind of style does JoonPyo like?

83
00:09:53,495 --> 00:10:08,539
Ah, it's pretty.

84
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,846
JanDi..

85
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:15,416
Girly style or boyish style?

86
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,054
Or does he prefer a cute style?

87
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:25,126
He's too busy worrying about his own style from head to toe.

88
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:28,931
He probably won't remember what you were wearing.

89
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:31,533
The more I learn about him, the more I like him.

90
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:35,736
I like the serious type.

91
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:44,203
Tell me more about him, Jan Di.

92
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:51,217
He is second to none when it comes to disdaining others and being arrogant.

93
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:57,366
He acts like a total know-it-all, but in reality, he's ignorant.

94
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:04,835
And... if he likes something...

95
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:08,424
he ignores others' opinions and pushes his own...

96
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:16,277
just like a bulldozer.

97
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:19,901
He's really scary when he's angry, but,

98
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:24,514
but when he's being nice,

99
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:34,717
he's really sweet.

100
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:40,035
Ah, in any case, if you put childish, spoiled, whiney brat all together,

101
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,366
that about sums him up.

102
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:46,073
JanDi, you really know JoonPyo well.

103
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,966
I'm impressed. I have a favor to ask you.

104
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:51,002
What is it?

105
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,671
I really want to make a go of things with him.

106
00:11:54,671 --> 00:12:00,095
Jan Di, from today can you be my dating coach?

107
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:21,161
I'm begging you.

108
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,631
That girl is an interesting character, isn't she?

109
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:30,273
That's true. She's second only to Geum Jan Di.

110
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,216
What's so funny?

111
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:35,781
Your fiancee. She's really funny.

112
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,447
Fiancee, who says she's my fiancee?

113
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:40,571
Why not? I'm in favor of it.

114
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:43,092
Compared to all the other rich and snoby girls, she's not so bad.

115
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:49,024
But, when did you guys get so intimate? I distinctly remember her saying she bit your ear.

116
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,195
Joon Pyo, isn't that your weak spot?

117
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:57,199
To be more exact, it's his sensitive spot.

118
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,802
Do you guys think this is funny?

119
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,958
Well?

120
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:07,001
And you call yourselves my friends...

121
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:16,825
Move aside.

122
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,059
Seriously, how will he handle it?

123
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,258
Sounds like JoonPyo's stuck in a corner and can't do anything.

124
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:26,747
It's one thing that the engagement is a business deal, but if she actually has feelings for him...

125
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:28,634
And on top of that, it's the JK Group.

126
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:33,178
If we don't do something fast, it'll only be a matter of time before Joon Pyo walks down the aisle.

127
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,171
You guys can take care of it.

128
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:38,138
What?

129
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:41,806
F4's Don Juan and Casanova.

130
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:56,226
Use some of your legendary skills.

131
00:13:56,226 --> 00:14:01,532
We can just go on by ourselves now.

132
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:07,017
I had a lot of fun today. And from now on, you two are Ha JaeKyung's "BFFs".

133
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:09,737
Okay? Huh?

134
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:14,332
Oh, and this. This is JanDi's.

135
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,087
And this is GaEul's.

136
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,709
What is this?

137
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,804
Their gifts to thank you for being my friends.

138
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:32,318
Good Night!

139
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:35,965
That Eon ni (big sister) seems a little strange.

140
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:39,869
A bit, eh?

141
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:56,418
In any case, she's not someone you can dislike easily.

142
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,321
Ah, it's cold.

143
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:04,394
You're back?

144
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,277
What's with everyone?

145
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,832
Is something wrong?

146
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:12,602
Is it true that Master Goo Joon Pyo got engaged?

147
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:28,095
How did you find that out?

148
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,755
It's true.

149
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:35,625
Ah, what can we do about this?

150
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:41,013
All this time we waited thinking "no news is good news", but...

151
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:45,634
What can we do for JanDi?What do you mean by "What can we do for JanDi"?

152
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,974
As if I have anything to do with him.

153
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,506
What?

154
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:51,409
Did someone die?

155
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:56,012
Why shouldn't you be concerned? Until just last year, you were slated to be<Br> the daughter-in-law of the ShinHwa Group.

156
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:57,881
What do you mean this doesn't concern you?

157
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:02,452
Wait just a second. We're really ruined.

158
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:06,286
I mean, where did this girl even come from?

159
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:09,392
This is just like the saying that the wheel that rolls in displaces the wheel that's in place.

160
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:35,951
Wait a second. We should find out what her name is and what her family does.

161
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,287
Hello.

162
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:44,794
Hi.

163
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:49,765
Wow, these are nice!

164
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,865
My name is Ha JaeKyung.

165
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,831
JanDi and I decided to be friends.

166
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:56,305
Oh no, I'm her elder sister.

167
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,709
Please take care of me. Ha JaeKyung?

168
00:16:59,709 --> 00:16:59,709
Wow, even your name is pretty. Your face is pretty, too.

169
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,398
What a pretty name!

170
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,197
Your face is pretty too.

171
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:10,647
If you and Jan Di decided to become sisters, then we should just make you a part of the family. Shouldn't we, honey?

172
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:14,057
From now on, think of this as your home and come to visit often.

173
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:16,192
Thank you!

174
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:26,895
Then, can I sleep over tonight?

175
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:34,544
Sorry?

176
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:38,348
Don't you get the feeling of a deja vu from this situation?

177
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,986
Yeah, I kept thinking that too.

178
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:50,125
JanDi, where's your room?

179
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,268
It seems just like a pajama party.

180
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:55,865
I always wanted to do something like this.

181
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:59,798
This room is really cozy.

182
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,532
Is it?

183
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:05,332
It's really fascinating.

184
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:06,376
What is it?

185
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:10,046
Meeting JanDi and JoonPyo in Macau

186
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,682
Seems like fate.

187
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:18,754
You've known JoonPyo since Macau?

188
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:24,626
I guess I must have liked him since the first time I saw him.

189
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:29,064
Engagement. If it had been anybody else, I would've made a scene.

190
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:34,704
But from the moment I saw him, my heart started racing.

191
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:37,273
JanDi, have you ever felt like that?

192
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:40,041
I mean, do you have anybody you like?

193
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:44,949
Like a first love?

194
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:57,395
So you do have one. What kind of person is he?

195
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:04,268
He was a rather dull person.

196
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,805
A dull person?

197
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:15,612
The kind of person that made me feel dull by comparison.

198
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,014
He was that kind of person.

199
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:25,088
Oh, I get it. He must be someone you feel comfortable with, a really sweet person.

200
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:28,057
Goo JoonPyo is just like wine.

201
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,393
Wine?

202
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:34,398
Wine has a great aroma. As soon as you drink it, your whole body just turns upside down.

203
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:37,935
That kind of exhilarating feeling.

204
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:45,976
Wait! You don't think he has a girl that he likes, does he?

205
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:52,916
Doesn't matter. I just need to make him like me.

206
00:19:52,916 --> 00:20:44,234
It's been a really long time since there's been something that I really wanted that I had to work hard on my own to get.

207
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,403
What?

208
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,538
Do you have something to say?

209
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,064
Why aren't you swimming?

210
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,342
I quit.

211
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:54,044
Why would a swimmer quit swimming?

212
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,012
None of your business.

213
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,081
Did you follow me just to ask that?

214
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:00,616
It's not in my nature to just let things go,

215
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:02,519
since I have to uncover what needs to be uncovered.

216
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,761
What?

217
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:09,325
That engagement or whatever. It doesn't concern me.

218
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:12,595
It doesn't concern me either.

219
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:13,863
Goo Joon Pyo

220
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:28,668
You've gotten really friendly; explaining things like this to the stain you want to erase.

221
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:39,055
Over there. Your fiancee is headed this way.

222
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:56,507
Why is that monkey showing up again?

223
00:21:56,507 --> 00:22:09,553
Sunbae. Could you give me a ride?

224
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:12,871
What a coincidence to see you both together like this!

225
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:17,077
JanDi and JoonPyo, I guess you two are really close.

226
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:23,467
- Oh. Who's this person?<BR>- This is JiHoo sunbae.

227
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,271
Why are you introducing my friend?

228
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:34,988
Hey, monkey! This is my friend, Yoon JiHoo.

229
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:40,797
Do you like him? Looks like you know what good-looking is.

230
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:43,252
I get it.

231
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:46,443
What? <BR>This person's the one, right?

232
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:55,761
What?The guy JanDi likes.

233
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:58,268
Oh, unni, no that's not... this person and I...

234
00:22:58,268 --> 00:23:02,447
That's great, let's go hang out, the four of us. What do you think? It's a good idea, eh?

235
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,875
- No. - We can't.

236
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,898
Eh? Why not?

237
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:11,515
Uh, I have to go someplace urgently, right now.

238
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:18,255
Unni, you two just go off and have fun.

239
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:25,329
Sunbae, let's hurry up and go.

240
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:35,472
Uh...

241
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:37,474
What shall we do now?

242
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:43,714
Do? Do what?

243
00:23:43,714 --> 00:24:05,202
Let's go together!

244
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,537
Are you working part-time here, too?

245
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:11,241
It's not a part-time job. I'm here to volunteer.

246
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,045
I just clean and help out here and there, but . . .

247
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:19,349
But when I'm here, I feel relaxed and I'm albe to study.

248
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:21,084
It's fascinating.

249
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,416
What is?

250
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:27,157
How you can do everything so diligently.

251
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:29,125
I guess I'll go inside then.

252
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:34,698
Bye.

253
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:38,235
Geum Jan Di!

254
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:44,041
I can clean pretty well, too.

255
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,054
Hello.

256
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:47,001
Hello

257
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,983
Hi!

258
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:49,078
Pretty girl, why are you only coming now?

259
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:54,117
I had to go to school. Just a minute.

260
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:59,589
You must eat before. <BR>Hello!

261
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:03,493
Thank you. <BR>Yes. On Sunday, be sure to come and eat here. Got that?

262
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:04,528
Grandma, let me check your temperature.

263
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:20,051
Go. Be careful.

264
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:37,894
JiHoo! JiHoo!

265
00:25:37,894 --> 00:25:44,535
What? That old man's, I mean, that doctor's grandson is JiHoo sunbae?

266
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:51,108
So, Jihoo sunbae is the grandson of former President Yoon, so that grandpa is...

267
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:54,945
...former President Yoon SukYoung?<BR>No way!

268
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,514
How is it they've gone on this long without seeing each other?

269
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,484
Going on this long without seeing each other wasn't a choice. They couldn't see each other.

270
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:04,487
What's that supposed to mean? Come on, what's your relationship to that grandpa?

271
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:08,091
JanDi, those two people, you have to help them.

272
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,804
Huh?

273
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:13,196
Welc . . .

274
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,599
Hello.

275
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:22,106
- GaEul, some water. <BR>- Me too.

276
00:26:22,106 --> 00:27:03,313
What's going on with you guys?

277
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:16,159
Queen Elizabeth liked this piece.. Do you like it too?

278
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,932
Wow! You're giving this to me?

279
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:27,036
Whether it be man or dish, we're always waiting for a woman to properly appreciate us.

280
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:32,676
Thank you. If i give this to my Leon as his water dish, he'll love it.

281
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:33,943
Leon?

282
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:39,316
It's my pet lion's name.

283
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:53,697
Lion?

284
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,946
Hey, miss.

285
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:57,901
You've got a killer style.

286
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,087
Why don't you have a cup of tea with us?

287
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:05,475
It's cold, don't you think?

288
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,809
Laughing?

289
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,785
This lady has no fear.

290
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:12,649
Kids.

291
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,653
Stop it right now.

292
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,523
Who are you?

293
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:23,961
You shouldn't bother a pretty lady.

294
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,695
Stop fooling around and get lost.

295
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:27,597
We had dibs on her first.

296
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,333
It's time for children to go home.

297
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,271
Go home. You'll get hurt.

298
00:28:34,271 --> 00:29:25,022
It's gotten a little noisy. Sorry.

299
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:28,458
Miss, Are you alright?

300
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:32,128
Thanks for helping me.

301
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:34,004
Ow . . . ouch!

302
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:39,953
Those idiots!

303
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:42,239
If that had been all, it would've been all right.

304
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,074
There's still more?

305
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:56,385
Don't even go there. That girl is a real monster!

306
00:29:56,385 --> 00:31:09,658
<i>♪ I want nobody..nobody but you

307
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:13,697
I've seen plenty of girls in my day, but that's the first time I've ever experienced that kind.

308
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,598
Then what are we going to do now?

309
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:18,435
That unni, she's close with us too.

310
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:22,138
We have no other choice but to use our last resort emergency plan.

311
00:31:22,138 --> 00:31:23,873
Emergency plan?

312
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:29,078
We'll give up on the monkey girl, and worry about getting the two idiots back together.

313
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:34,005
The two idiots?

314
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:38,876
So that's why I'm saying...

315
00:31:38,876 --> 00:32:28,834
GaEul, you're going to have to help us.

316
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:34,342
I was the one that killed them.

317
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:40,282
I was the one who turned him into an orphan.

318
00:32:40,282 --> 00:33:05,038
It's all my fault...

319
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:16,469
Hello. What?! you and YiJung sunbae are doing what?

320
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:18,119
DATE.

321
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,939
No, you can't. You can't, GaEul.

322
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:26,042
Why? YiJung sunbae's not a bad person.

323
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:31,659
Uh, that is... he's not bad.

324
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,188
He's not a bad person, but,

325
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:37,744
That person is F4's biggest...

326
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:39,047
Biggest?

327
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,028
In any case, GaEul!

328
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:46,204
It would be a good idea to really think this over.

329
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:49,006
I don't know. He said he's picking me up early tomorrow.

330
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:54,097
So I'm going to bed early, though I don't know if I'll be able to sleep.

331
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:58,091
Good night, Jandi. Bye.

332
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:09,245
err...GaEul..

333
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:12,023
So YiJung?

334
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:14,359
So YiJung.

335
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:34,138
So YiJung?

336
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:41,319
JiHoo sunbae, answer your phone! Please!

337
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:57,613
<i>- The number you have called cannot answer... -

338
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:59,286
GaEul,

339
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:00,771
How are you?

340
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:10,881
No way, no way. NO WAY!

341
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:14,124
Yo! Geum JanDi, what's up?

342
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:24,228
Sunbae, Goo JoonPyo, where is Goo JoonPyo?

343
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:27,864
Goo JoonPyo!

344
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:34,355
Hey!

345
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:38,692
- Ah, Sunbae! - You asked where he was, you didn't ask what he was doing.

346
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:46,617
Ahhh! What the hell's with you?

347
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:51,822
Goo JoonPyo, help me. There's big trouble!

348
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:52,836
Big trouble?

349
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:54,536
It's out of my control.

350
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:56,802
I don't have any money or a car.

351
00:35:56,802 --> 00:35:58,937
What if something happens?

352
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:02,687
Something happens? What will happen?

353
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:06,203
What happens if they end up at a hotel?

354
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:09,073
Hotel?

355
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:12,576
Geum Jandi, I know you've gotten a shock because of that Monkey, but...

356
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,911
Why are you doing things you don't usually do?

357
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:21,664
YiJung sunbae says he's going on a date with GaEul.

358
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:26,057
Now that I think about it, YiJung did mention a girl he was stuck on.

359
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:29,693
I wonder how long GaEul will last?

360
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:35,232
Two days? No, it may only take him one day to finish her off.

361
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:36,868
O... One day?

362
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:41,321
Geum JanDi, don't you know what YiJung's nickname is? "5 second Kill."

363
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:45,275
"5 seconds Kill?"

364
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:48,962
One. .

365
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:51,282
Two.

366
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:55,219
Three.

367
00:36:55,219 --> 00:37:00,456
Four.

368
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:25,215
Five

369
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:39,378
GaEul..

370
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:44,101
No way... No way!!!

371
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:45,736
Has YiJung taken drugs?

372
00:37:45,736 --> 00:37:48,272
To date GaEul . . .

373
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,541
What is that supposed to mean?

374
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:54,908
Honestly speaking, GaEul isn't YiJung's type.

375
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:59,884
YiJung never dates anyone unless theis body is better than LeeHyori and their face is better than Kim TaeHee.

376
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,219
With GaEul?

377
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,022
Leave them in an empty room together for 3 nights and 4 days.

378
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:06,423
See if anything happens.

379
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:08,892
No, he actually said

380
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:13,464
that something about GaEul was really cute.

381
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:16,007
See! Now what are we going to do?

382
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:18,268
What are we going to do?

383
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:21,018
So, what do you want me to do?

384
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:23,608
Come here.

385
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:30,214
Give me your ear.

386
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:40,491
- I don't know. <BR>- Why?

387
00:38:40,491 --> 00:39:01,812
Oh. He's here.

388
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:05,045
Are you ready?

389
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:13,523
- Yes. <BR> - You and I are both suffering because of our idiot friends.

390
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:16,894
Do you think we can pull it off without getting caught?

391
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:21,231
Don't worry. Just follow my lead.

392
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:37,414
We've already done this acting thing together once before.

393
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:42,119
Hey. Get down!

394
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:49,727
Don't be nervous.

395
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:52,431
Hey, start the car. Fast, fast! Start.

396
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:57,501
Ah! Really!

397
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,335
Okay.

398
00:39:58,335 --> 00:41:35,899
Let's go.

399
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:43,774
Grandfather probably still hates me.

400
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:52,649
All the people I love always end up leaving me behind.

401
00:41:52,649 --> 00:42:01,223
I tried to live as though I didn't need anyone, but...

402
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:05,562
I keep wanting to hold on to everyone.

403
00:42:05,562 --> 00:43:25,791
What should I do?

404
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,036
It's been hard, hasn't it?

405
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:43,136
No, it's been fun.

406
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:47,584
Who wouldn't mistake him for a player?

407
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:53,039
YiJung Sunbae's ridiculous.

408
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:55,323
So would you rather he didn't care

409
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:58,627
whether she froze to death or not?

410
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:03,166
Well, no, it's not that.

411
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,698
Look at your lips turning blue.

412
00:44:05,698 --> 00:44:12,401
You'd probably freeze before your friend.

413
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:15,763
Come here.

414
00:44:15,763 --> 00:44:33,735
- Hey, what are you doi...? <BR>- Just stay still.

415
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:47,606
I'm o, okay.

416
00:44:47,606 --> 00:44:50,793
Look. I told you this would work.

417
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:53,017
Yeah.

418
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:56,227
Then, should we slowly lead up to the climax?

419
00:44:56,227 --> 00:45:15,208
Eh?

420
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:29,666
Are you ready?

421
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:39,401
How is it that you guys can make a fireworks displaylook as simple as setting off a kid's firecracker?

422
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:43,012
That rascal, he sure is cool.

423
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:51,375
Was it that cool when I did that?

424
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,872
But...

425
00:45:54,872 --> 00:46:01,193
What was the last thing YiJung said?

426
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:05,456
What do you mean? There's only one thing he could have said in that situation.

427
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:10,036
What's that?

428
00:46:10,036 --> 00:46:12,648
Should we go up?

429
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:23,815
Go up where?

430
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:28,152
No way. No way!

431
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:32,416
Though he's my friend, he sure is a real player.

432
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:35,413
How could he bring her to a hotel?

433
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:38,000
I was wondering why he took her skating.

434
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,429
Wow. I didn't know there was a deeper meaning behind it.

435
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:41,592
Be quiet!

436
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:43,494
I can't hear anything.

437
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:46,297
Do you know how many stars this hotel has? Do really think you'll be able to hear anything?

438
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:47,561
Then what should I do?

439
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:50,303
Why don't you go outside and stand guard.

440
00:46:50,303 --> 00:46:54,604
Oh, that's right.

441
00:46:54,604 --> 00:47:03,981
Hey!

442
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:05,216
Goo JoonPyo! Goo JoonPyo!

443
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:06,075
What's wrong?

444
00:47:06,075 --> 00:47:15,093
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

445
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:20,898
Oh my god! YiJung Sunbae must have prepared that.

446
00:47:20,898 --> 00:47:24,268
Hey, do something!

447
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:25,469
What?

448
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:31,054
That's the mark of a player, we can't let that go in that room.

449
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:34,611
Hey, let's go bring that here.

450
00:47:34,611 --> 00:47:40,005
- What? - Hurry! Hurry!

451
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:48,025
Ah, really!

452
00:47:48,025 --> 00:48:11,514
Hurry! Go! I said go!

453
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:27,564
Thank you.

454
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:30,767
It's a complete success.

455
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:32,469
Will everything be all right?

456
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:36,607
I'm not sure. As a couple, they have so much going against them...

457
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,442
We've done all we could, so we'll just have to wait and see.

458
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:48,385
You did great today, GaEul.

459
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:50,254
Oh, WooBin.

460
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:53,029
We're about to finish up here.

461
00:48:53,029 --> 00:49:25,723
Okay.

462
00:49:25,723 --> 00:49:32,743
- Congratulations.- Thank you.

463
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:35,899
Though it's late, Happy Birthday.

464
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:42,539
Though it's late, thanks for the present.

465
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,575
You got my gift?

466
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:49,012
That was the first time I've ever received such a crappy gift.

467
00:49:49,012 --> 00:49:59,324
But I'll accept it because it's the thought that counts.

468
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:04,009
Though it's late . . .

469
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:05,963
Congratulations on your engagement.

470
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:09,099
I told you to stop thinking about that!

471
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:11,735
JaeKyung Unni is a good person.

472
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:14,071
Eon ni?

473
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:19,309
She really,

474
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:28,418
Really likes you a lot.

475
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:32,189
You're still as nosy as ever!

476
00:50:32,189 --> 00:50:33,957
That's right.

477
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:40,296
If you didn't drive me crazy, then you wouldn't be Geum JanDi.

478
00:50:40,296 --> 00:50:42,632
So . . .

479
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:46,803
would you be happy if I just gave up and got married tomorrow?

480
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:54,244
Would that make you feel better?

481
00:50:54,244 --> 00:51:01,438
Ah, what is that girl doing?

482
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:05,189
I'm going to go out for a little bit.

483
00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:27,511
This girl...

484
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:28,812
Everything is going well, right?

485
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:31,381
Yes, everything is going just fine.

486
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:36,819
By the way, JoonPyo is currently in a hotel room.

487
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:41,024
JoonPyo's in the hotel right now?

488
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:52,101
Yes.

489
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:53,537
What is this?

490
00:51:53,537 --> 00:51:56,074
Why can't I hear anything?

491
00:51:56,074 --> 00:52:03,913
They can't be...

492
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:11,042
You there!

493
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:14,057
What are you doing here?

494
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:17,761
H-Hello.

495
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:21,398
You really are a girl I can't let slide.

496
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:30,406
Or are you finally showing your true colors?

497
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:38,082
This is why I was careful from the start in preventing him from hanging around with kids from trashy families.

498
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:41,285
Your words are a little harsh.

499
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:47,224
My family is not trashy.

500
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:52,763
If a still wet-behind-the-ears girl who follows a boy into a hotel, isn't trashy, then...

501
00:52:52,763 --> 00:53:04,874
Hey, Geum Jandi! You!

502
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:05,909
Why?

503
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:11,082
Did JoonPyo's engagement make you nervous?Is that why you thought you'd try to throw yourself at him?

504
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:19,787
You rude, awful girl! Stop it!

505
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:21,924
Please.

506
00:53:21,924 --> 00:53:40,008
Stop.

507
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:49,044
Get JoonPyo out of here.

508
00:53:49,044 --> 00:54:48,081
Young Master.

509
00:54:48,081 --> 00:55:04,486
Let's go, Young Master.

510
00:55:04,486 --> 00:55:09,062
Contacts: Yoon JiHoo

511
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:15,031
Touch to send

512
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:19,714
Send

513
00:55:19,714 --> 00:55:20,282
Sending . . .

514
00:55:20,282 --> 00:56:16,972
Message sent to Yoon JiHoo.

515
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:18,831
Hello?

516
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:19,993
Where are you?

517
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:23,716
Ah, I'm at home.

518
00:56:23,716 --> 00:56:25,552
Is anything wrong?

519
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:30,863
What do you mean?There's nothing wrong.

520
00:56:30,863 --> 00:57:59,663
Okay.

521
00:57:59,663 --> 00:58:05,515
S-Sun-Sunbae.

522
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:11,941
I see this has become Geum Jandi's house.

523
00:58:11,941 --> 01:00:50,881
I couldn't sleep, so I came out to get some air and to study. So...

524
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,581
Yeah, mom?

525
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:57,195
What's wrong?

526
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,086
Mom!

527
01:00:59,086 --> 01:01:01,875
Was there some kind of accident?

528
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:02,947
Mom!

529
01:01:02,947 --> 01:01:08,061
MOM!

530
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:41,327
What's happening?

531
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:45,069
Honey.

532
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:47,869
Look at that.

533
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:51,606
If you have any eyes, just look.

534
01:01:51,606 --> 01:01:54,976
What are we going to do from now on?

535
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:59,313
It's hard enough paying the interest with what we're making now.

536
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:03,554
How could you think about vouching for someone's debt ?

537
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:04,435
That is . . .

538
01:02:04,435 --> 01:02:09,145
Long before our situation became like this, a friend asked to just borrow my name.

539
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:10,525
Just your name?

540
01:02:10,525 --> 01:02:14,563
With just your name, how could these red tags... (reposessions)

541
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:16,063
Oh honey!

542
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,736
Oh, headache! headache!

543
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:26,014
Hello?

544
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:32,935
Yes, this is Mr. Geum Il Bong and Mrs. Na Gong Ju's residence.

545
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:41,355
The Art Center?

546
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:49,196
I'm sorry, but my parents have been ill lately.

547
01:02:49,196 --> 01:02:53,233
Could I do it in their place?

548
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:58,939
What I'm saying is that it puts me in a tight spot if they don't come back to work soon.

549
01:02:58,939 --> 01:03:00,064
I'm sorry.

550
01:03:00,064 --> 01:03:05,245
I'll do everything that's been needing to be done.

551
01:03:05,245 --> 01:03:10,055
Can't you let this go until they get better?

552
01:03:10,055 --> 01:03:15,089
I'm letting this go because even though you're little, you're so earnest.

553
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:18,519
Then, I'm trusting you.

554
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:21,761
Thank you.

555
01:03:21,761 --> 99:59:59,999
Thank you!

1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,255
Let's get started and learn how to convert percentages to decimals,

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:08,917
and if we have time maybe we'll also learn how to convert decimals into percentages.

3
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:13,049
So let's get started with what I think is a problem you probably already know how to do.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,258
If I said I have fifty percent.

5
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:19,512
I don't know if I wanted to write that thick,

6
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:20,610
but we'll go with it.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,410
Actually, let me change it to a thinner one.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,440
And I want to turn that into a decimal.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,945
Well you probably already have a sense of what decimal represents fifty percent.

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,565
If I told you we're having a sale and it's fifty percent off,

11
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,901
you know that's roughly half off, or another way,

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,860
how do you say half as a decimal?

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:43,609
Well that's the same thing as zero point five.

14
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:44,771
So you might have known that in your head,

15
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:49,980
but is there a system for being able to convert this fifty percent to point five?

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,770
Well, it turns out it's pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,590
All you do is you say-- whatever percentage it is,

18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:03,750
that's the same thing as the number over one hundred.

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:13,847
And fifty over one hundred is the same thing as five over ten or point five.

20
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:17,763
Now even a simpler way of converting percentage to decimals.

21
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:20,435
And this, I think, you're going to realize converting a percentage to a decimal

22
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:21,674
or the other way around,

23
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,790
you can pretty much do in your head.

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,955
If I say, let's say fifty-- and I'm just going to add one decimal of accuracy here

25
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:34,160
just to show you a point-- fifty percent. Right?

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,502
If I want to convert that fifty percent into a decimal,

27
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,900
all I do is I get rid of the percent sign.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,310
So I'll do it here.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,490
Fifty percent.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,090
I get rid of the percent sign and I take the decimal point

31
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,940
and I move it over two spaces to the left.

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,575
So I say one, two.

33
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:57,570
So this is where the new decimal is.

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,250
So this equals, we could say zero point five zero zero.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,529
So fifty percent is equal to zero point five zero zero.

36
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:15,683
And of course, these last two zeros really don't mean anything for our purposes,

37
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:16,620
so we'll get rid of them.

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,295
So that's the same thing as zero point five or just point five.

39
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,280
Fifty percent equals point five.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,800
So you're probably saying, well, sure.

41
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,344
That looks easy,

42
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,690
but what if the problem gets a little harder?

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,100
Fifty percent I could have done in my head.

44
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,070
So let's try some, I would say, slightly harder problems.

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:46,230
If I were to tell you that-- let's say sixteen point three two percent.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,090
Well, let's just do it the way I just showed you.

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,180
I'll rewrite it down here.

48
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,510
Sixteen point three two percent.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,333
So if we get rid of the percent sign, scratch it out,

50
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,730
we just have to move the decimal over two spaces to the left.

51
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,830
So one, two.

52
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,240
This is the new place for the decimal.

53
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,580
That decimal goes away.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:23,330
So it's point one six three two is equal to sixteen point three two percent.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,840
I think you might be getting the idea now.

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,300
Let me do another one in green.

57
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,946
Let's say I had--

58
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,520
and this one actually confuses a lot of people.

59
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:41,820
Let's say I had zero point two five percent.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,940
So the important thing to remember is, I'll rewrite here.

61
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,591
Zero point two five-- and maybe I'll write zero zero point--

62
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,142
And you're probably wondering why I'm doing this,

63
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:57,505
but I think you'll see in a second why I wrote that leading zero there

64
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,010
even though it doesn't seem to add much to it.

65
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,620
Zero zero point two five percent.

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,240
Well, what's the system I just showed you?

67
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,066
You get rid of the percent sign,

68
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:10,068
and you move the decimal over one, two spaces.

69
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:15,930
So that equals point zero zero two five.

70
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,370
So point two five percent is equal to point zero zero two five.

71
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,470
And you could put a leading zero here if you want.

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,080
Actually, I should probably tell you to always do that

73
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,250
because it makes it easier to read.

74
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,040
So point two five percent is equal to point zero zero two five.

75
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,122
And I want to just contrast that with twenty-five percent.

76
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:44,505
Twenty-five percent, what do you think that equals?

77
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:47,970
Well, you do the same thing that we've been doing.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,670
You get rid of the percent sign and you move the decimal space.

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,220
In this case-- actually, let me leave that there.

80
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,782
I'll just rewrite it here.

81
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:56,982
Twenty-five percent.

82
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:58,312
And you're probably saying, where is the decimal in this?

83
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,887
Well, the decimal is after the number

84
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:04,550
because that twenty-five percent is the same thing as twenty-five point zero percent.

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,008
So if we get rid of the percent sign,

86
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:10,874
we move the decimal over two spaces to the left,

87
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:16,540
and that equals point two five as a decimal,

88
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,220
or point two five zero, but we can ignore that last zero.

89
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,455
So twenty-five percent equals point two five,

90
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:29,123
while point two five percent is equal to point zero zero two five.

91
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:35,375
And I want you to maybe sit and think about how small of a number point two five percent is.

92
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,325
Let's do a couple more

93
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:41,315
and maybe we'll convert going the other direction.

94
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:47,862
Let's say I have the decimal point zero one

95
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:56,327
and I wanted to convert that into a percent.

96
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,319
Well, here we just do it the opposite.

97
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:00,550
We could look at it two ways.

98
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,916
We could say well, whatever number this is,

99
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,180
we multiply it by one hundred and add a percent sign.

100
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,991
So if you say point zero one times one hundred,

101
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,570
and then we'll add a percent sign.

102
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,140
So point zero one times one hundred?

103
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,730
Well that's just one.

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,420
You could do the math.

105
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,370
You add the percent sign.

106
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,540
Well, that equals one percent.

107
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,920
Or an even easier way, when we go from a percent to a decimal,

108
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,760
we move the decimal place over two to the left.

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,920
So when you go from a decimal to a percent,

110
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,160
we'll do the opposite.

111
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,240
We move the decimal two to the right.

112
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,680
So if we do that, let me just rewrite it.

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,420
Point zero one.

114
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,950
Just go one, two.

115
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,785
The new decimal place is here.

116
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:54,608
If I get rid of that decimal, that's zero one decimal zero zero-- whatever.

117
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,324
Obviously, this leading zero means nothing,

118
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:58,820
so that's the same thing as one point zero zero.

119
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,342
Which is the same thing as one.

120
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:07,368
And does it make sense that moving the decimal space two to the right--

121
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:11,708
that's really just the same thing as multiplying it by one hundred, right?

122
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,845
If I multiply something by ten,

123
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,980
it's like moving the decimal space one to the right.

124
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,966
If I divide something by ten,

125
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:22,220
it's like moving the decimal space one to left.

126
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,310
Let's do a couple more while I have time.

127
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,611
I think I have three more minutes.

128
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:32,965
Let's say I had one point two five,

129
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:37,800
and I wanted to convert that to a percent.

130
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,370
Well, the easiest way is just to take-- I'll rewrite it here.

131
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,180
One point two five.

132
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,110
Take the decimal point, move it two to the right.

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,180
That's here.

134
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,210
And then I'll add a percent.

135
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,450
So that equals one hundred twenty-five percent.

136
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,285
And if you think about it,

137
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,250
the way people talk about percent it makes sense.

138
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,752
If I told you that I'm going to pay one point two five

139
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:06,109
times the price of something.

140
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:10,081
That makes sense that that's also one hundred twenty-five percent of the price.

141
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:10,843
Or if it doesn't make sense,

142
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:14,620
hopefully if you do these problems enough it will start to make sense.

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,680
Let's do a couple of more.

144
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,576
And you can go back and pause this if you think I'm going too fast,

145
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:26,206
which I might be doing.

146
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,675
Let me think.

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,295
If I were to say point zero zero three

148
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:39,510
and I want to write this as a percent.

149
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,912
Well, once again,

150
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:45,000
we can move the decimal space two to the right.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
So one, two.

152
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,820
And that's analogous to multiplying it by one hundred.

153
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,412
So if we multiply the decimal two to the right

154
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:57,110
we get zero zero decimal point three.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,065
And then we add the percent.

156
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:01,850
These don't-- at least this first leading zero doesn't mean anything,

157
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,771
so that's the same thing as zero point three percent.

158
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:07,816
The important thing to realize

159
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:12,432
is when you're converting from a percent to a decimal or a decimal to a percent,

160
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,928
you're really just moving where that decimal point is.

161
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:17,018
And if you run out of space,

162
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:20,098
you just have to add or get rid of zeros accordingly.

163
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:23,070
And the important thing to always have in your mind is,

164
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,696
when I convert from a decimal to a percent,

165
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,220
the number in front of percent signs going to get bigger.

166
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,282
And when I go from a percent sign to a decimal,

167
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,910
I'm going to get a smaller number.

168
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:41,870
If I say twenty-five percent, that's the same thing as point two five. Right?

169
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,072
So this is a percent, and this is a decimal.

170
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:52,079
So I went from a bigger number, twenty-five, to a smaller number, point two five.

171
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,570
Twenty-five percent is equal to point two five.

172
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,830
Similarly, if I had a decimal, let's say point one.

173
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,404
When I convert it to a percentage,

174
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:03,280
it's going to be a larger percentage.

175
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,035
So point one is the same thing as ten percent.

176
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,420
And how did I do that again?

177
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,838
Well I said point one, I added an extra zero

178
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:17,209
because I'm going to have to move the decimal space over to the right twice.

179
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:20,780
So I go one, two, and I get a ten.

180
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,720
Ten percent.

181
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,940
Hopefully that answers all your questions for now.

182
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,163
Have fun!

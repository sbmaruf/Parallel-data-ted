1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's learn to multiply.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,980
M U L T I P L Y.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,837
And the best way I think to do anything is just to actually do some examples,

4
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:13,615
and then talk through the examples,

5
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:15,680
and try to figure out what they mean.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,310
In my first example I have two times three.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,856
By now you probably know what two plus three is.

8
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:27,488
Two plus three.

9
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:28,444
That's equal to five.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,850
And if you need a bit of a review you could think of

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,830
if I had two-- I don't know-- two magenta--

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,590
this color-- cherries.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,880
And I wanted to add to it three blueberries.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,950
How many total pieces of fruit do I now have?

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,910
And you'd say, oh, one, two, three, four, five.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,091
Or likewise, if I had our number line,

17
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:57,710
and you probably don't need this review, but it never hurts.

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,030
Never hurts to reinforce the concept.

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:09,580
And it this is zero, one, two, three, four, five.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,166
If you're sitting two to the right of zero

21
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,570
and in general when we go positive we go to the right.

22
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,393
And if you were to add three to it,

23
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:22,200
you would move three spaces to the right.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,184
So if I said, if I just moved over three to the right,

25
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:27,180
where do I end up?

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,110
One, two, three.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
I end up at five.

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,950
So either way, you understand that two plus three is equal to five.

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,790
So what is two times three?

30
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,386
An easy way to think about multiplication or "timesing" something

31
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:47,150
is it's just a simple way of doing addition over and over again.

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,270
So that you means is, and it's a little tricky.

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,230
You're not going to add two to three.

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,472
You're going to add--

35
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,750
and there's actually two ways to think about it.

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,822
You're going to add two to itself three times.

37
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,065
Now what does that mean?

38
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:07,720
Well, it means you're going to say two plus two plus two.

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,060
Now where did the three go?

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,930
Well, how many twos do we have here?

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,375
Let's see, I have-- this is one two, I have two twos,

42
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,920
I have three twos.

43
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,396
I'm counting the numbers here

44
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,345
the same way that I counted blueberries up here.

45
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:23,960
I had one, two, three blueberries.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,830
I have one, two, three twos.

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,081
So this three tells me how many twos I'm going to have.

48
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,220
So what's two times three?

49
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,050
Well, I took two and I added it to itself three times.

50
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,180
So two plus two is four.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,768
Four plus two is equal to six.

52
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,145
Now that's only one way to think about it.

53
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:51,854
The other way we could have thought about this is we could've said,

54
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:56,248
instead of having two added to itself three times,

55
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:59,020
we could have added three to itself two times!

56
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,376
And I know it's maybe becoming a little bit confusing,

57
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,050
but the more practice you do it'll make a little sense.

58
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,940
So this statement up here, let me rewrite it.

59
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,820
Two times three.

60
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,672
It could also be rewritten as three two times.

61
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:19,870
So three plus three.

62
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,295
And once again, you're like, where did this two go?

63
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,076
You know, I had two times three

64
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:28,110
and whenever you do addition, you see I have two-- oh, I don't know these--

65
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:30,460
well, I said cherries, but they could be raspberries or anything.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,587
And then I have two things, I have three things

67
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,170
and the two and the three never disappear.

68
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,610
And I add them together, I get five.

69
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,510
But here I'm saying that two times three

70
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,070
is the same thing as three plus three.

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,200
Where did the two go?

72
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,851
Two in this case, in this scenario,

73
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:48,580
is telling me how many times I'm going to add three to itself.

74
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,102
But what's interesting is, regardless of which way I interpret two times three,

75
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,786
I can interpret it as two plus two plus two,

76
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,870
or adding two to itself three times.

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,611
I can interpret it that way or I can interpret it

78
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,105
as adding three to itself two times.

79
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,376
But notice, I get the same answer.

80
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,320
What's three plus three?

81
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,110
That is also equal to six.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,537
And this is probably the first time in mathematics

83
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:19,330
you'll encounter something very neat!

84
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,478
Sometimes, regardless of the path you take,

85
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,350
as long as you take a correct path you get the same answer.

86
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,886
So two people can kind of visualize it--

87
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:29,385
as long as they're visualizing it correctly,

88
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:33,800
two different problems, but they come up with the same solution.

89
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,443
And so you're probably saying,

90
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:42,680
Sal, when is this multiplication thing even useful?

91
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,870
And this is where it's useful.

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Sometimes it simplifies counting.

93
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,682
So let's say I have a--

94
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:56,570
well, let's stick with our fruit analogy.

95
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,425
An analogy is just when you kind of use something as--

96
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,080
well, I won't go too much into it.

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,700
But our fruit example.

98
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,120
Let's say I had lemons.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,030
Let me draw a bunch of lemons.

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,800
I'll draw them in rows of three.

101
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,819
So I have one, two, three-- well, I'm not going to count them

102
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,920
because that'll give our answer away.

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm just drawing a bunch of lemons.

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,060
Now, if I said, you tell me how many lemons there are here.

105
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,573
And if I did that,

106
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:31,190
you would proceed to just count all of the lemons.

107
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,028
And it wouldn't take you too long to say, that oh,

108
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:39,038
there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve lemons.

109
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,460
I actually already gave you the answer.

110
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,170
We know that there are twelve lemons there.

111
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,872
But there's an easier way

112
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:48,000
and a faster way to count the number of lemons.

113
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,940
Notice: how many lemons are in each row?

114
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,940
And a row is kind of the side to side lemons.

115
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,860
I think you know what a row is.

116
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,320
I don't want to talk down to you.

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,090
So how many lemons are there in a row?

118
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,280
Well, there are three lemons in a row.

119
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,720
And now let me ask you another question.

120
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,160
How many rows are there?

121
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,020
Well, this was one row, and this is the second row,

122
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,670
this is the third row, and this is the fourth row.

123
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,377
So an easy way to count it is say, I have three lemons per row

124
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:32,500
and I have four of them.

125
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,350
So let's say I have three lemons per row.

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,350
I hope I'm not confusing you, but I think you'll enjoy this.

127
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,805
And then I have four rows.

128
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:43,068
So I have four times three lemons.

129
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:46,365
Four times three lemons.

130
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,600
And that should be equal to the number of lemons I have-- twelve.

131
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,618
And just to make that gel with what I just did with the addition,

132
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:56,089
let's think about this.

133
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,533
Four times three, literally when you--

134
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,002
and you know, when you actually say the words four times three,

135
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,619
I visualize this.

136
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:07,018
I visualize four times three.

137
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,004
So three four times.

138
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:11,817
Three, plus three, plus three, plus three.

139
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:13,258
And if we did that we get:

140
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:15,129
Three plus three is six.

141
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,830
Six plus three is nine.

142
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,538
Nine plus three is twelve.

143
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:23,815
And we learned, up here, in this part of the video,

144
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:27,256
We learned that this same multiplication

145
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,617
could also be interpreted

146
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:33,025
as three times four.

147
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,758
You can switch the order.

148
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,540
And this one of the useful

149
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,848
and interesting, actually, kind of properties of multiplication.

150
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:46,704
But this could also be written as four three times.

151
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,867
Four, plus four, plus four.

152
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:52,500
You add four to itself three times.

153
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,588
Four plus four is eight.

154
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:58,133
Eight plus four is twelve.

155
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:02,545
And in the U.S. we always say four times three,

156
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,863
but you know, I've met people

157
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,632
and a lot of people in my family they kind of learned in the--

158
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:09,800
I guess you could call it the English system.

159
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,864
And they'll often call this four threes, or three fours.

160
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:15,625
And that in someways is a lot more intuitive.

161
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,498
It's not intuitive the first time you hear it,

162
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,348
but they'll write this multiplication problem,

163
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:21,231
or they'll say this multiplication problem.

164
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,364
They'll say, what are four threes?

165
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,115
And when they say four threes,

166
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:27,545
They're literally saying, what are four threes?

167
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:31,602
So this is one three, two threes, three threes, four threes.

168
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:34,155
So what are four threes when you add them up?

169
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,413
It's twelve.

170
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:37,871
And you could also say, what are three fours?

171
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:41,354
So let me write this down.

172
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,793
Let me do it in a different color.

173
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:46,987
That is four threes.

174
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:48,863
I mean literally, that's four threes.

175
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:52,529
If I told you, say, write down four threes and add them up,

176
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,444
that's what that is.

177
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,532
And that is four times three.

178
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:57,329
Or three four times.

179
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,964
And this is-- let me do it in a different color,

180
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,449
that is three fours.

181
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:13,057
And it could also be written as three times four.

182
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,667
And they all equal twelve.

183
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,448
And now you're probably saying,

184
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,753
okay, this is nice, it's a cute little trick, Sal,

185
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:19,713
that you've taught me,

186
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:24,946
but it took you less time to count these lemons

187
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:26,569
than to you know, do this problem.

188
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:30,221
And well first of all, that's only right now because you're new to multiplication.

189
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:33,718
But what you'll find is that there are times,

190
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,425
and there are actually many times--

191
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:39,202
I don't want to use the word times too much in a video on multiplication--

192
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,665
where each row of lemons,

193
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,670
instead of having three,

194
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,400
maybe they have one hundred lemons!

195
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,210
Maybe there's one hundred rows!

196
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,100
And it'll take you forever to count all the lemons,

197
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,423
and that's where multiplication comes in useful,

198
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:57,339
although we're not going to learn right now how to multiply one hundred times one hundred.

199
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,049
Now the one thing that I want to give you,

200
00:09:59,049 --> 00:09:59,930
and this is kind of a trick,

201
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,202
I remember my sister, just to try to show how much smarter she was than me,

202
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,081
when I was in kindergarten and she was in third grade,

203
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:12,638
She would say,"Sal, what is three times one?"

204
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:14,575
And I would say, because my brain would say,

205
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:16,390
Oh! That's like three plus one,

206
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,776
and I would say three plus one is equal to four.

207
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:20,276
And so I'd say,

208
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:23,579
Oh! You know, three times one, that must be four as well.

209
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,944
And she'd say,"No, silly! It's three!"

210
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,240
And I was like, how can that be?

211
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,278
How can, you know, three times some other number still be the same number?

212
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,336
And think about what this means.

213
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:39,373
You could view this as three ones.

214
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,487
And what are three ones?

215
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:44,773
That's one one, plus another one, plus another one.

216
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,430
That's equal to three.

217
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,200
Or you could do this as three one time.

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,323
So what's three one time?

219
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,505
It's almost silly how easy it is!

220
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:54,668
It's just three.

221
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:55,955
That's one three.

222
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,826
You could write this as one three.

223
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,313
And that's why anything times one,

224
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,985
or one times anything,

225
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:05,550
is that anything!

226
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,244
So then, three times one is three.

227
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,225
One times three is three.

228
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:13,871
And you know, I could say, one hundred times one

229
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:16,557
is equal to one hundred.

230
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:20,948
I could say that one times thirty-nine

231
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,428
is equal to thirty-nine.

232
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:26,601
And I think you're familiar with numbers this large by now.

233
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:27,873
So that's interesting.

234
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:32,001
Now there's one other really interesting thing about multiplication.

235
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:34,683
And that's when you multiply by zero.

236
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:37,858
And I'll start with the analogy, or the example, of when you add.

237
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:41,291
Three plus zero, you've hopefully learned,

238
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,198
is three.

239
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,850
Because I'm adding nothing to the three.

240
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,875
If you have three apples,

241
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,965
and I give you zero more apples,

242
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:48,960
you still have three apples.

243
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,997
But what is three--

244
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:53,120
and maybe I'm just fixated on the number three a little too much--

245
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,017
well, so let me switch--

246
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:59,231
What is four times zero?

247
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:03,490
Well this is saying zero four times.

248
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,235
So what's zero, plus zero, plus zero, plus zero?

249
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:11,587
Well, that's zero!

250
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:14,124
Right? I have nothing, plus nothing, plus nothing, plus nothing.

251
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,366
So I get nothing!

252
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,649
Another way to think of it,

253
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,894
I could say, four zero times.

254
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:21,108
So how do I write four zero times?

255
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,088
Well I just don't write anything, right?

256
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,312
Because if I write anything,

257
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,940
if I write one four, then I don't have "no fours".

258
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,150
So this is saying--

259
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,785
so this is four--

260
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,216
let me write this--

261
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:36,295
this is four zeros.

262
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:40,871
But I could also write zero fours.

263
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:41,865
And what are zero fours?

264
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:43,553
Well, I just write a big blank here.

265
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:44,373
There, I wrote it!

266
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,882
There are no fours here!

267
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:47,579
So it's just a big blank.

268
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,687
And that's another fun thing.

269
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:50,859
So, anything times zero is zero!

270
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,795
I could write a huge number.

271
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:59,436
You know, five million four hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred ninety-two

272
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,540
times zero.

273
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,640
What does that equal?

274
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,327
That equals zero.

275
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,162
And by the way,

276
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,200
what's this number times one?

277
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,516
Well it's that number again.

278
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:12,395
What's zero times seventeen?

279
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:15,179
Once again, that is zero.

280
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,256
Anyway, I think I've talked for long enough.

281
00:13:18,256 --> 99:59:59,000
See you in the next video!

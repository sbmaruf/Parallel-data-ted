1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:01,764
Let's see if we can
learn a thing or two

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,020
about significant
figures, sometimes

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,880
called significant digits.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,020
And the idea behind
significant figures

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,040
is just to make sure that
when you do a big computation

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,610
and you have a bunch
of digits there,

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,140
that you're not
over-representing

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,790
the amount of
precision that you had,

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,900
that the result isn't more
precise than the things

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,210
that you actually measured, that
you used to get that result.

11
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,634
Before we go into
the depths of it

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,150
and how you use it
with computation,

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,600
let's just do a
bunch of examples

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,180
of identifying
significant figures.

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,350
Then we'll try to come up
with some rules of thumb.

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,960
But the general way to think
about it is, which digits

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,110
are really giving me
information about how precise

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,720
my measurement is?

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,950
So on this first
thing right over here,

20
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,700
the significant figures
are this 7, 0, 0.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,420
So over here, you have
three significant figures.

22
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:53,882
And it might make you a little
uncomfortable that we're not

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,010
including these 0's that
are after the decimal point

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,720
and before this 7, that
we're not including those.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,510
Because you're just like, that
does help define the number.

26
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,180
And that is true, but
it's not telling us

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,710
how precise our measurement is.

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,840
And to try to understand
this a little bit better,

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,600
imagine if this right over
here was a measurement

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,960
of kilometers, so if we
measured 0.00700 kilometers.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,300
This would be the exact
same thing as 7.00 meters.

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,630
Maybe, in fact, we just
used a meter stick.

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,010
And we said it's
exactly 7.00 meters.

34
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,030
So we measured to the
nearest centimeter.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,880
And we just felt like
writing it in kilometers.

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,250
These two numbers are
the exact same thing.

37
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:40,462
They're just different units.

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,960
But I think when
you look over here,

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,720
it makes a lot more
sense why you only

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,590
have three significant figures.

41
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,140
These 0's are just
shifting it based

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,110
on the units of measurement
that you're using.

43
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:55,437
But the numbers that are
really giving you the precision

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,190
are the 7, the 0, and the 0.

45
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,479
And the reason why we're
counting these trailing 0's is

46
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,700
that whoever wrote this number
didn't have to write them down.

47
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,316
They wrote them down
to explicitly say,

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,820
look, I measured this far.

49
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,359
If they didn't
measure this far, they

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,270
would have just
left these 0's off.

51
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,540
And they would have just
told you 7 meters, not 7.00.

52
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,600
Let's do the next one.

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,660
So based on the same idea,
we have the 5 and the 2.

54
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,330
The non-zero digits are going
to be significant figures.

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,560
You don't include
this leading 0,

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,610
by the same logic that if
this was 0.052 kilometers,

57
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,290
this would be the same thing as
52 meters, which clearly only

58
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,410
has two significant figures.

59
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,050
So you don't want
to count leading

60
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:52,770
0's before the first non-zero
digit, I guess we could say.

61
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,570
You don't want to include those.

62
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,370
You just want to include all the
non-zero digits and everything

63
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,750
in between, and trailing 0's
if a decimal point is involved.

64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,150
I'll make those ideas a
little bit more formal.

65
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,720
So over here, the
person did 370.

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
And then they wrote
the decimal point.

67
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:12,256
If they didn't write
the decimal point,

68
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,700
it would be a little unclear
on how precise this was.

69
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:16,412
But because they wrote
the decimal point,

70
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,130
it means that they measured
it exactly to be 370.

71
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,990
They didn't get 372
and then round down.

72
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,360
Or they didn't have
kind of a roughness only

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,980
to the nearest tens place.

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,120
This decimal tells you that all
three of these are significant.

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,100
So this is three significant
figures over here.

76
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,090
Then on this next one,
once again, this decimal

77
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,210
tells us that not only did
we get to the nearest one,

78
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,960
but then we put another
trailing 0 here,

79
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,890
which means we got
to the nearest tenth.

80
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,520
So in this situation,
once again,

81
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,760
we have three
significant figures.

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,100
Over here, the 7
is in the hundreds.

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
But the measurement
went all the way down

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,980
to the thousandths place.

85
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,760
And even though there
are 0's in between,

86
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,630
those 0's are part
of our measurement,

87
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,790
because they are in
between non-zero digits.

88
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,660
So in this situation,
every digit here,

89
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,970
the way it's written,
is a significant digit.

90
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,530
So you have six
significant digits.

91
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,830
Now, this last one is ambiguous.

92
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,210
The 37,000-- it's
not clear whether you

93
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,079
measured exactly 37,000.

94
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,089
Maybe you measured
to the nearest one,

95
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,889
and you got an exact number.

96
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,430
You got exactly 37,000.

97
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,500
Or maybe you only measured
to the nearest thousand.

98
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,780
So there's a little
bit of ambiguity here.

99
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,600
If you just see something
written exactly like this,

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,630
you would probably say, if you
had to guess-- or not guess.

101
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,169
If there wasn't any
more information,

102
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,100
you would say that there's
just two significant figures

103
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,690
or significant digits.

104
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,730
For this person to
be less ambiguous,

105
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,620
they would want to put a
decimal point right over there.

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,120
And that lets you know
that this is actually

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,060
five digits of precision,
that we actually

108
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,590
go to five significant figures.

109
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,690
So if you don't see that decimal
point, I would go with two.

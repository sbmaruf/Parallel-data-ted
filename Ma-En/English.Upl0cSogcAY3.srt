1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
about what they don't know, or don't understand,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or is foreign to them.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They only learn to be frightened of those differences

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
when an adult influences them to behave that way,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or you know, reins in the question-asking

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in the hopes of them being polite little kids.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
don't stare at her legs."

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But, of course, that's the point.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So I made a deal with the adults

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
on their own.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to see what happens with that.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I said, "Kids, really quickly --

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
nothing too big, two or three stories --

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
anything you can dream up right now,

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
what kind of legs would you build me?"

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then, one eight-year-old said,

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
(Laughter)

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And just like that, I went from being a woman

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Somebody that might even be super-abled.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Interesting.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
which you may have seen on stage yesterday.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to come bring their talent to the science and to the art

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
of building legs.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and assigning them different values.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and she gave me a cover story.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This started an incredible journey.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
men and women.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And the conversation would go something like this,

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't look disabled."

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
(Laughter)

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I thought, "Well, that's amazing,

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
because I don't feel disabled."

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that could be explored, about beauty.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What is a sexy body?

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
what does it mean to have a disability?

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Nobody calls her disabled.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
(Laughter)

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
who were also interested in exploring that conversation.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to London, doing my first fashion shoot,

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
which resulted in this cover --

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
"Fashion-able"?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Actually, I have them on stage with me:

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Poetry matters.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
to a realm of art.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
into something that invites them to look,

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and look a little longer,

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and maybe even understand.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is where it really hit home for me --

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that my legs could be wearable sculpture.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
as the only aesthetic ideal.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
a.k.a. bowling ball material.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Heavy!

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and a very lovely brass toe.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's a good close-up of that one.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
a little homage to my life as an athlete.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
14 hours of prosthetic make-up

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
to get into a creature that had articulated paws,

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
claws and a tail that whipped around,

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
like a gecko.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
(Laughter)

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
look like jellyfish legs,

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
also polyurethane.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And the only purpose that these legs can serve,

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
outside the context of the film,

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So whimsy matters.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that various people have made for me,

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and I can change my height --

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have a variable of five different heights.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
(Laughter)

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Today, I'm 6'1".

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
at Dorset Orthopedic in England

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and when I brought them home to Manhattan,

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And a girl was there who has known me for years

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
at my normal 5'8".

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and she went, "But you're so tall!"

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that I never expected I would ever have.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I was having fun with it.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And she looked at me,

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
(Laughter)

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
(Applause)

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not fair that you can change your height,

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
as you want it.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that's when I knew --

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that's when I knew that the conversation with society

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
has changed profoundly

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in this last decade.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a conversation about augmentation.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a conversation about potential.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in that space.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So people that society once considered to be disabled

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
can now become the architects of their own identities

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and indeed continue to change those identities

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
by designing their bodies

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
from a place of empowerment.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And what is exciting to me so much right now

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is that by combining cutting-edge technology --

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
robotics, bionics --

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
with the age-old poetry,

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think that if we want to discover the full potential

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
in our humanity,

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and those glorious disabilities that we all have.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
"If you prick us, do we not bleed,

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It is our humanity,

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and all the potential within it,

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that makes us beautiful.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
(Applause)

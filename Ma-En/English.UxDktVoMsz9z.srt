00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:15,367
Episode 9 .

3
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,633
Stop right there!

4
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:21,072
Hey!

5
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:24,005
Hey stop right there you punk!

6
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,005
Hey!

7
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:30,733
<i>Baek Seung Jo is running with meOh! it doesn't seem true.

8
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:52,009
<i> It really doesn't seem true.

9
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,233
Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would.

10
00:00:56,233 --> 00:01:02,061
Sorry...

11
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:10,505
But the work out seems to have had an effect, seeing how you managed to keep up so well.

12
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:15,833
But, you knew?That we were following you?

13
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,667
It would be weird if I didn't know. You're obvious.

14
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,833
I didn't have a choice.

15
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,567
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...

16
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,327
Without knowing...

17
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:35,003
But if you happen to like Hae Ra,

18
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:45,367
That is something... I can do nothing about.

19
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,133
Do you want to go somewhere?

20
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,667
What?

21
00:01:48,667 --> 00:02:10,167
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere?

22
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,133
<i>It's like a dream...

23
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,167
<i>Me being with Seung Jo.

24
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>With Seung Jo.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:29,667
It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day.I'm happy now

26
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:33,003
But, it looks like only families are here.

27
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,867
We are the only ones who look like a couple.

28
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:42,267
Of course.There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months.

29
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,499
You didn't know?What?

30
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,009
You didn't know? It's well known.

31
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:52,973
After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating.

32
00:02:52,973 --> 00:03:03,667
You know what? Let's just get out of here!

33
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:24,008
What to do?!

34
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,003
Wear it until your clothes dry.

35
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:34,167
It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes.

36
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:38,233
They were selling them by the road.

37
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,533
You don't like it?

38
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:45,133
It's the same?

39
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:54,005
Then, it's couple t-shirts?

40
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,006
Hamburger!

41
00:03:56,006 --> 00:04:10,002
I was so hungry.

42
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:11,007
<i>It's really good.

43
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:15,006
<i> Better than the delicious French or Italian food.

44
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:21,333
<i> I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again.

45
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,000
<i> I wish time would stop right here.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,433
Eat! Don't just look at it

47
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:34,167
But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?

48
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,933
You were with Hae Ra. . .

49
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:42,133
That's because. . . You were the one closest to me.

50
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,002
Thank you.

51
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:46,533
I keep causing trouble all the time.

52
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:53,633
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.

53
00:04:53,633 --> 00:05:00,833
But after you showed up... I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.

54
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:08,008
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.

55
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,233
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.

56
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:16,933
Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve.

57
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:20,433
Is the ordeal...possibly me?

58
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:27,833
At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it.

59
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:33,567
But now, I won't run from it.

60
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,933
If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer.

61
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,367
I'm going to approach it head on.

62
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,002
Huh?

63
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,933
You're going to face me head on?

64
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,002
If you don't get it then forget it.

65
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:49,367
No, I get it.

66
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:56,867
So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away.

67
00:05:56,867 --> 00:06:03,733
But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me.

68
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,009
Are you proposing to me?!

69
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,467
How could you have come to that conclusion?

70
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,067
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.

71
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:22,009
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.

72
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,267
Thank you.

73
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,005
I really thought that you hated me.

74
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:32,008
Ever since high school, I have only liked you.

75
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:38,333
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche .And I can't even cook.

76
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,008
And I'm not glamorous,

77
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:46,033
But still, I'll try my best. I'll know to always try my best .

78
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,533
Really?

79
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,003
I'm looking forward to it.

80
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:51,009
What?

81
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,008
You getting smarter for me... I'm looking forward to it.

82
00:06:56,008 --> 00:07:01,267
Okay. Since the midterms are not that far away,

83
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:06,233
That confession... I'll make sure of it with the test results. Okay?

84
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:11,001
Midterms?

85
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,167
But I hate exams.

86
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,007
Is there anyone who likes exams?

87
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:20,167
Then, can I get a C?

88
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,267
C?!

89
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,567
What are you talking about getting a C.

90
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:55,333
Then C+?

91
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:02,333
His words were as mischievous as always, but his smile was a little different from before.

92
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:08,367
<i> More than the day I gave him my first love letter, more than the day we first kissed,

93
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:25,000
<i> I think Baek Seung Jo feels closer to me.

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,633
Thank you. You even walked me home.

95
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,233
It's like a perfect date.

96
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:35,003
Is it okay living here?

97
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:39,007
Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small. But it's tolerable.

98
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:42,099
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.

99
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,367
We're staying here until the new house is built.

100
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,833
Will it be okay?

101
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,007
What?

102
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:56,833
I'm talking about Hae Ra. She was the one you were meeting today. . .

103
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,433
How could you have parted that way.

104
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:12,009
Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae.

105
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:18,733
Excuse me, Hae Ra. I have something to tell you.

106
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:26,667
It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen.

107
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,333
I know. I am not good enough.

108
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,667
Pardon?

109
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:35,867
Not good enough?

110
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,067
Then have mine too.

111
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:41,867
I didn't mean... Foo... food is enough.

112
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:45,333
I'll continue.

113
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:53,002
I have tried my best not to think about it,

114
00:09:53,002 --> 00:10:00,000
But I keep thinking of you. . .

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,967
Should I just leave? I have a headache.

116
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:08,167
You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it.

117
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:19,467
Take your time, I will pay and leave now.

118
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:26,467
Hae Ra. I know that I lack a lot of things. That's why

119
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:32,867
I decided to try hard and not think of you

120
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:42,233
Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head.

121
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:59,087
That's what I wanted to say.

122
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:14,553
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

123
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,053
Dad! What?

124
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,453
Oh,

125
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,153
Did something good happen today?

126
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,953
Huh?

127
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:28,665
No, what good thing?

128
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:32,022
Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us.

129
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:35,887
Why? <BR><BR>Did something happen?

130
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:41,411
Oh, it's not that...

131
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:46,018
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.

132
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:50,053
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.

133
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:53,032
And the company who was supposed to construct

134
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:58,022
are just shrinking from their responsibility.

135
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,653
Then what should we do, Dad?

136
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,753
Ah, don't worry.

137
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:05,487
It will be resolved, but it will take some time.

138
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:08,078
Although it might be uncomfortable,

139
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,487
plan on staying here for a while.

140
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:12,853
Yes.

141
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:14,062
I am sorry, Ha Ni!

142
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:18,493
What's there for you to be sorry about?

143
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:21,119
Don't worry about me.

144
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:26,153
I am fine.

145
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:42,787
Okay.

146
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,662
Welcome!

147
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:44,787
-Hello!-Hello!

148
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:45,092
Oh, you two came?

149
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,663
We didn't even open yet!

150
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:49,033
Sit! Sit!

151
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,687
What are you doing here at this time?

152
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,445
Ha Ni went to school already.

153
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:58,553
We know. We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.

154
00:12:58,553 --> 00:12:59,092
Seafood noodles?

155
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,012
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.

156
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:03,287
I got it, i got it!

157
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:07,032
Over here! Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.

158
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:10,409
Ooh! Bong Joon Gu!

159
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,753
Sounds like it's your territory. Super charismatic, huh?

160
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:15,853
Right, huh? Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?

161
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:20,453
Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it.

162
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:25,002
Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored.

163
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:25,753
What...what did you say?

164
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:29,653
Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women.

165
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:33,022
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?

166
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,092
Because Seung Jo is cold.

167
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:37,187
What? Cold?

168
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:40,353
To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer.

169
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,878
If they come towards us, we want to run away.

170
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:44,787
Is that true?

171
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:53,356
Yeah. If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu.

172
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,153
No, no.

173
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:59,353
Chef kept talking about being sought after! So I tried it out...

174
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:02,353
But it does not really fit the personality

175
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:05,087
And I can not play, For hard to reach.

176
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:08,072
I'm a guy from Busan. I'm doing as I please.

177
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:16,012
Then someday, won't Ha Ni realize the potential Bong Joon Gu has?

178
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:24,087
When are the So Pal Bak noodles coming out?

179
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,092
Oh!

180
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:27,587
Hi!

181
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:28,753
Did you get home safely?

182
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:29,092
Yesterday?

183
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:33,087
Ah yes, of course! I did get home safely.

184
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:37,299
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.

185
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,002
But, it seems like you did worry about me.

186
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,052
Anyways, it was fun. It was like we were shooting a movie.

187
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:46,299
"Gangsters and Hae Rin"

188
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,366
I'm glad that you got home safely.

189
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,933
Let's go inside.

190
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:57,766
Look at this. Wonderful perfection, a goddess.

191
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,233
You sure did take a lot of pictures.

192
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,899
Wow, look at this. She looks pretty, right?

193
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,433
So, what happened yesterday?

194
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,799
You did have a date, right?

195
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,431
What date? We just ate and left right after.

196
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,999
Ah, I should have paid for the food.

197
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,666
Ah, what is that?!

198
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,533
How could you when you had the perfect chance?!

199
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,366
You should have confessed.

200
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:25,199
Confession... I did plan on doing it.

201
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,499
But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank.

202
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:30,633
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.

203
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:36,999
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.

204
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,166
Why? You do have charisma.

205
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,866
I know I have charisma.

206
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,799
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...

207
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,099
Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?

208
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:53,053
I had written a love letter before.

209
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,333
Letter! Wow, why didn't I think of that? Letter.

210
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,122
Aigoo, you should never do that!

211
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:02,633
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.

212
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,899
If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself.

213
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,933
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.

214
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:13,799
Girls like that the best.

215
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,899
I can't even look at her right. What do you mean look her in the eyes?

216
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,333
Why? You can practice.

217
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,466
Here. Just think that I'm Hae Ra.

218
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:37,833
Should I?

219
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,466
That won't work.

220
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:41,666
Why? You can practice. Just try it again.

221
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,733
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?

222
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,333
You try. I'm Baek Seung Jo. Try it.

223
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:56,899
I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo.

224
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,666
At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue...

225
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,066
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!

226
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,199
When she bites her tongue.

227
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,533
Hey, Hey! What are you doing?

228
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,766
Are you crazy? Why are you doing this?

229
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,133
This is practice.

230
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,866
Practice?

231
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:11,933
The timing is important. Look at this.

232
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,099
If the girl says

233
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,833
"What is this? What are you doing?!"

234
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,666
then you put your hands like this

235
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,433
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me."

236
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:22,633
and just go in for the kiss.

237
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,799
Hey!

238
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,399
You have talent, it's very real.

239
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,366
- Really? - Wow, so if the girls say "What are you doing?"

240
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:32,066
Then, slam... "If you can forget me, try forgetting me"

241
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:33,099
Wait!

242
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:37,766
Here, the timing is important. When the girl lifts her head like this...

243
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,133
Then,

244
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,233
When she lifts her head...

245
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,433
"Why? What are you doing?"

246
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,999
Slam. " Try to forget me if you can."

247
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,633
That's right.

248
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:50,066
That's it!

249
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,299
Hey, I'm busy. Go and let the students practice.

250
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,433
Oh Ha Ni, teach him well.

251
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,533
Yes.

252
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,266
Now, Sunbae, you be the girl.

253
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:57,973
Okay, girl.

254
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:59,833
The head is lifted like this.

255
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,466
"What are you doing to me?"

256
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,966
"Try to forget me if you can"

257
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,325
You won't be able to forget it, right?

258
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,533
I won't be able to forget it. Wow, this is really great!

259
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,999
Yes, I understand the timing now.

260
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:16,005
But for the kiss... when I watch movies

261
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:18,799
Do I turn to the left or right. Or like spiderman...

262
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,599
Do I do it upside down?

263
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,587
The angle?

264
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:24,133
No, I think kissing is about timing.

265
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,366
Ah, kissing is timing.

266
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,866
Timing...

267
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:30,566
Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing.

268
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,666
No. Truthfully, I don't really know about it.

269
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,633
What are you talking about? If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book.

270
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:37,587
Isn't she hard to understand?

271
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:41,133
In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around.

272
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,366
You heard about that too? Is that rumor true?

273
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,199
Yes.

274
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,833
There must be a fun rumor going around.

275
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:52,499
Ah. A student at our school left the guy she had a crush on...

276
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,999
and supposedly kissed another guy.

277
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:59,099
On top of that, it was in broad daylight at school.

278
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,233
How could she? Dumping someone like Baek Seung Jo.

279
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,866
Dumping?!

280
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:05,366
That doesn't make sense.

281
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,566
With a completely old looking sunbae.

282
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:09,733
Ah, that girl! Really!

283
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,066
Oh, look here! If you just leave like this...

284
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:17,866
Unnie!

285
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,066
Seung Jo came. He came.

286
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:22,866
- It seems like Seung Jo doesn't know about it. - He doesn't.

287
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:25,399
Oh Ha Ni even kissed Kyung Sunbae.

288
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,133
Ha Ni to Kyung Sunbae... Kiss?!

289
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,899
That's right, a kiss.

290
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,633
Oh Ha Ni is really great.

291
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:35,933
She even said to him "Can you do it one more time?".

292
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,833
Then, what happens with Baek Seung Jo?

293
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,366
What do you mean? Oh Ha Ni dumped him.

294
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,033
Dumped?

295
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:46,599
What is it you want to say?

296
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:55,899
Hae Ra, I...

297
00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:00,766
It's fine. I'll just leave for today.

298
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:08,999
But, Hae Ra...

299
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,833
Sunbae!

300
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,033
Let go. I'm going to do it! If she wants to forget, she'll forget. I'm going to do it!

301
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,733
- Wait a minute. - Hey!

302
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,633
Put the racket down.

303
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,799
Let go of me! I'm going to do that.

304
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,899
No, no!

305
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,633
- Ah, no! - Ha Ni!

306
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,366
Oh Ha Ni ah!

307
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:29,066
Ha Ni ah! Ah..

308
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:31,899
Oh, Ha Ni ah!

309
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,166
- Oh Ha Ni! - You're going to leave already?

310
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:40,062
What do you mean? Me with Kyung Sunbae?

311
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:42,633
They were right?

312
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,399
You did do it?

313
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,533
Kiss?

314
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,399
That's not it.

315
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:50,233
I was so frustrated that I was just educating him.

316
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,899
Educating?

317
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,999
Educating about what?

318
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,153
Perhaps...

319
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:57,033
Sex education!

320
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:01,566
Hey, sex education?! It's not that.

321
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:12,575
Oh, I'm so sorry.

322
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,525
Rumors have spread everywhere.

323
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:20,423
Huh?!

324
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,025
Are you sad?

325
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:26,876
Since the girl that was following you has left?

326
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:32,521
Seung Jo ah!

327
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:36,004
Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor.

328
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,729
Miss Calm Cat,

329
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,676
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?

330
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,018
Have you heard?

331
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:44,015
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.

332
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,319
I'm leaving first.

333
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,791
Good luck

334
00:21:51,791 --> 00:22:00,064
Congratulations.

335
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:04,084
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?

336
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,934
Of course.

337
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,738
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.

338
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,371
Do you think I'm a baby?

339
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,739
I also....

340
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:11,934
need to spend some time alone.

341
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,014
Look at you.

342
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:15,243
That's right.

343
00:22:15,243 --> 00:22:17,026
Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow.

344
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:18,443
Hurry!

345
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:19,859
Don't play too many games.

346
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,134
I won't.

347
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:22,211
Just leave quickly.

348
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,448
Let's go.Ok

349
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:31,583
Aigoo

350
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:58,551
Alright!

351
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:20,888
Oh!

352
00:23:20,888 --> 00:24:05,076
"Seung Jo ah"

353
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:10,161
<i>I came all the way here without even realizing it.

354
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:13,737
<i> How did I end up here?

355
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:30,477
<i>And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date.

356
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:36,019
What is that sound?

357
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,023
Mother!, Eun Jo ah!

358
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:42,669
Ouch!!

359
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,455
Eun Jo ah!

360
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:50,067
You.....Eun Jo ah!

361
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:53,164
Eun Jo ah!, Eun Jo what's wrong?

362
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:54,463
My stomach.

363
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:55,881
Your stomach hurts?

364
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:59,666
What about you mother?, Where is she?

365
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,627
Vaca...

366
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:02,087
Vacation?

367
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:05,123
What to do ?

368
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:12,036
Hold on!

369
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:13,164
Hello.

370
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:15,454
Baek Seung Jo!

371
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:17,094
Why are you calling from our house?

372
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:21,469
Eun Jo is...Eun Jo is in pain!

373
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,948
Eun Jo?

374
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:24,581
What happened to Eun Jo?

375
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:27,876
He seems very sick.

376
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,039
What to do?

377
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,177
What should I do?!

378
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,338
Oh Han Ni calm down.

379
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:34,585
Calm down and explain it clearly.

380
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:35,075
What happened to Eun Jo?

381
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,039
He said his stomach hurts.

382
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,034
He keeps throwing up.

383
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:41,338
Really?

384
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:43,011
It might be appendicitis.

385
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:46,561
Write down what I'm about to tell you and act accordingly.

386
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:54,697
Place him on his side so he doesn't choke on anything.

387
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:56,369
Keep his body warm.

388
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,203
Keep in mind how many times he threw up

389
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,364
and then, tell the doctor.

390
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:00,618
Hold on.

391
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:02,028
Then call the ambulance.

392
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:02,678
This is 119, right?

393
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:03,521
after that..

394
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,728
Bring him to Parang University Hospital.

395
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:05,571
He's an elementary school student.

396
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,631
I'll get there as soon as possible.

397
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:09,906
Oh Ha Ni..

398
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:31,679
Take care of Eun Jo.

399
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,173
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.

400
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:35,193
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.

401
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,122
An intussusception?

402
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:39,821
It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope.

403
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:42,644
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.

404
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,398
Surgery?

405
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,535
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.

406
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:49,241
But....

407
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,355
What to do?

408
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:53,837
It's not a serious surgery.

409
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:57,682
<i>Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo.

410
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:19,729
I understand. Begin the surgery.

411
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:20,089
You came?

412
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:24,233
Yes.

413
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:26,741
Eun Jo is having surgery.

414
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:36,677
I heard about it.

415
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:38,683
How did it go?

416
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:41,532
It was as I had thought. His intestine was folded into itself.

417
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:42,693
Did the surgery end?

418
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:45,027
Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry.

419
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:49,496
A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,

420
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:51,493
And returned it to normal.

421
00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:59,527
After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut.

422
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:11,764
-Baek Eun Jo -No Ri.

423
00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:38,946
Thank you.

424
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:40,441
My parents...

425
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:43,179
are coming up on an evening flight.

426
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,899
Uhmm..

427
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:46,369
They must have been very surprised.

428
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:49,246
The doctor complimented you.

429
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:52,404
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.

430
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:55,185
If you hadn't told me how,

431
00:28:55,185 --> 00:29:00,387
I wouldn't have been able to do anything

432
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:06,563
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.

433
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:09,117
I had no idea.

434
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:11,343
I really...

435
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:19,049
had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.

436
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:23,235
I will call my dad.

437
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:25,418
He must be worried.

438
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:30,108
Oh Ha Ni!

439
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:34,752
Ah, my cellphone and my wallet...

440
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:38,629
where did I leave it all?

441
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:40,934
I, really...

442
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:50,602
How old am I that I'm already...

443
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:54,021
You know..

444
00:29:54,021 --> 00:30:03,034
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...

445
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:15,447
He explained everything to me already.

446
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:24,605
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.

447
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:27,438
I was afraid...

448
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:31,021
that I might do something wrong.

449
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:40,711
So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo.

450
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:53,344
Everything is alright now.

451
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:55,058
<i> It's the first time that I heard..

452
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:59,356
<i>warm words from Baek Seung Jo.

453
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:02,714
<i>Since my anxious feelings were all relieved...

454
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,775
<i>My eyes and heart...

455
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:21,223
<i>I cried so much they nearly melted away.

456
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:23,371
Hello!

457
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:24,323
Hi Eun Jo.

458
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:27,019
Omo! You made it today.

459
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,023
The flowers smells good.

460
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:33,557
It's Oh Ha Ni again?? She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...

461
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:34,723
Baek Eun Jo.

462
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,049
How could you talk to your life saver like that??

463
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:39,672
That's alright.

464
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,009
It seems like you're not getting tested today.

465
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:41,089
Yes.

466
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:44,069
In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways.

467
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:52,223
Here you go again.

468
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:53,423
Seung Jo didn't come yet?

469
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,009
See, I told you.

470
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,223
It's all about Seung Jo.

471
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:58,057
If you keep saying that...

472
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,036
He'll be coming soon.

473
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:03,059
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.

474
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,099
Again?

475
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,457
You came?

476
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:13,023
Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that...

477
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:16,523
Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?

478
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:18,523
Eun Jo, are you okay?

479
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:23,657
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

480
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:25,257
How is Eun Jo?

481
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:28,657
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.

482
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:29,723
True.

483
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:32,123
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.

484
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,757
Thank you.

485
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:35,059
Thank you, Oh Ki Dong.

486
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,079
It's a relief that everything is fine.

487
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,723
How is the building of your house coming along? Is it doing alright?

488
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:47,123
You know, it's a major pain.

489
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:54,257
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.

490
00:32:54,257 --> 00:32:57,089
We're still fighting over it right now.

491
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:06,039
It'll all go well, I guess.

492
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:09,039
Well, here.

493
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,357
What is this?

494
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:16,039
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.

495
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,957
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.

496
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,857
Why are you giving this back to me?

497
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,019
You shouldn't do this. You helped us so much during that time.

498
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:28,049
I can't accept this. Here.

499
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,157
Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?

500
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:33,323
If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad.

501
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:34,857
Yes.

502
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:37,057
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..

503
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,039
I know that you were going to build a second floor.

504
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,323
And because of the new house, and Ha Ni...

505
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:45,069
I also know that you couldn't do anything.

506
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,857
But, still... this.

507
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:49,957
Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and...

508
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:53,029
just come live with us again? Yes?

509
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:55,019
I came out because of Ha Ni.

510
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:57,657
This is better for Ha Ni.

511
00:33:57,657 --> 00:34:00,557
Pardon? For Ha Ni?

512
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:05,657
How can you not know your daughter's heart?

513
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:12,657
Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?

514
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:14,069
Pardon? Hide something?

515
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:18,019
Those two have even kissed!

516
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:21,023
And Seung Jo did it first.

517
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:22,123
Kiss?

518
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,029
Seung Jo did?

519
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,223
Yes.

520
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:35,019
So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along.

521
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:37,057
Hello, Eun Jo!

522
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:40,059
You came again?

523
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:42,757
Go Ri, hello!

524
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:44,079
It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!

525
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,099
That's right.

526
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:48,823
Hello, No Ri!

527
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:53,523
Hello.

528
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,099
I brought cake to give to you.

529
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,457
So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?

530
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:01,099
No Ri, No Ri!

531
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,923
I'm sorry. I'm not that smart.

532
00:35:04,923 --> 00:35:06,257
No, it's okay.

533
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:10,323
Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun.

534
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:12,019
But, it's fun and nice here.

535
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:15,157
No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?

536
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:19,657
Yes, about 1 year and 2 months.

537
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:22,523
So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade.

538
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,009
Really?

539
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:27,657
Then, I'll teach you your homework.

540
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:29,823
You're going to teach him?

541
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:31,657
Do you think that makes sense?

542
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:34,523
He's an elementary school student.

543
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:35,069
So rash.

544
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:37,323
Dummy how can you?

545
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:40,057
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.

546
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:43,823
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.

547
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:45,323
Really?

548
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:47,523
It's going to be more harmful than anything.

549
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:52,223
Let's just eat the cake.

550
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,323
Thank you.

551
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:58,257
Uhjjoo! No Ri, you too!

552
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,823
She's recognized a dummy!

553
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:02,023
These guys...

554
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:02,823
Melong (sticking tongue out/ way of teasing)

555
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:03,923
Hey!

556
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:24,623
Baek Eun Jo!

557
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:27,823
Chef! Are you worried about something??

558
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:28,423
Oh!

559
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:31,323
Your face has a look of concern.

560
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,823
Oh, are you finished?

561
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:36,157
Yes, of course! I cleaned everything.

562
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:39,723
Good job.

563
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:43,089
Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?

564
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,257
Huh?

565
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:47,069
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?

566
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:49,723
You can go home now.

567
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:51,049
Yes, Chef. I'll be leaving.

568
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:53,957
Okay. Good work today.

569
00:36:53,957 --> 00:37:06,723
- Get home safely. - Yes!

570
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:21,566
Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature.

571
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:23,466
No Ri gets fevers very often.

572
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:26,733
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.

573
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:29,633
So, you should have been more careful around him.

574
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,009
If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?

575
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:33,033
I'm sorry.

576
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:37,005
Please be cautious.

577
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,933
I'm sorry, No Ri.

578
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:43,166
This is nothing. I'm already used to it.

579
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:47,193
After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun.

580
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:49,466
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.

581
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:52,266
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.

582
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:55,966
I wasn't intending to be funny though...

583
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:58,009
Okay, let's just rest for today.

584
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,009
When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again.

585
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:16,933
Yes.

586
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:20,001
What is his sickness?

587
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:22,666
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.

588
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:26,005
Oh, I see.

589
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:34,001
That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday.

590
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:37,008
He can't even do everything he wants to do.

591
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:41,866
There's no use in your crying.

592
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,966
That's right.

593
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:47,005
If it was you, you could have done something to help him.

594
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,637
What can I do?

595
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:50,673
You're a genius.

596
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:55,002
So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it.

597
00:38:55,002 --> 00:39:02,633
So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri.

598
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,366
Everyone would be grateful towards you.

599
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:09,005
How does it sound?

600
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:12,866
If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?

601
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:17,266
Yeah, please do it. It's a really good idea right?

602
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,009
Well...

603
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:23,066
Being a doctor is best for you.

604
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:27,966
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...

605
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,009
I want to see you like that.

606
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:36,666
You're incorrigible . . .

607
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,766
You go to the hospital everyday?

608
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:43,633
So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?

609
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:49,233
Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two.

610
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,000
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.

611
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,966
Hey, what are you saying...

612
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:55,006
No? What no

613
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:58,133
We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!

614
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:08,566
What are you saying?

615
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:10,008
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!

616
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,005
How do you read this?

617
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:13,366
How much is it?

618
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:15,466
Yes, what does it mean?

619
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:16,008
How much is this?

620
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:17,004
Correct.

621
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:20,333
Hey guys, let's eat a snack.

622
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,008
What is this?

623
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:31,366
Hey, what's the use in knowing that?

624
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:34,666
The No Ri that we love

625
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,333
Happy Birthday to you!

626
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:43,009
Happy Birthday!

627
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:54,766
No Ri, happy birthday!

628
00:40:54,766 --> 00:41:00,166
Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged.

629
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,266
Thank you.

630
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:06,866
Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me.

631
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:10,899
Okay. If there's something you don't know, always call me.

632
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:12,001
You know my phone number, right?

633
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:18,033
Yes, I will.

634
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:21,766
No Ri, get healed quickly.

635
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:28,000
Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem.

636
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,866
No Ri,

637
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,003
No Ri,

638
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:34,266
Eun Jo, I'm fine.

639
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:37,002
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.

640
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,009
I will definitely come over too.

641
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:44,133
Yes. You must come.

642
00:41:44,133 --> 00:42:13,486
Yes, I will definitely come.

643
00:42:13,486 --> 00:42:16,433
No Ri didn't cry...

644
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,205
and he held it in really well.

645
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:25,867
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before. Even though he's sad too.

646
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:56,015
Eun Jo, we're going.

647
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:58,732
Eun Jo! Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!

648
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:05,977
Ha Ni, you came back well!

649
00:43:05,977 --> 00:43:07,611
Dad, what is all this?

650
00:43:07,611 --> 00:43:10,519
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt...

651
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:13,097
and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.

652
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:14,085
Dad.

653
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:17,942
Up til now, the upstairs room...

654
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:19,729
was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?

655
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:26,066
Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family.

656
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:28,938
Welcome Ha Ni.

657
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:29,778
(Seung Jo's) Mother.

658
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:33,207
Yeah. Welcome back, Ha Ni!

659
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:34,839
Thank you, Ahjushi.

660
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:35,761
Then what about my room?

661
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:39,005
Your room is with your brother.

662
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:42,738
No! I don't want to give up my room again.

663
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:46,039
You need to say thank you to your noona.

664
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,329
No. I just did what I had to do.

665
00:43:49,329 --> 00:44:03,154
I'm tired. Give us dinner.

666
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:04,793
You can go up now.

667
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:05,986
Ha Ni, you finished everything too?

668
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:07,958
Yes, I'll finish up the rest.

669
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:10,394
Okay, then it's a favor.

670
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:15,885
Good night.

671
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:17,517
Ha Ni.

672
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:24,983
Welcome.

673
00:44:24,983 --> 00:44:27,383
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

674
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:33,811
I want to drink some water.

675
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:40,117
Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet.

676
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:44,917
This time, you helped with a lot of things.

677
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:49,874
Thank you.

678
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:51,617
Punk.

679
00:44:51,617 --> 00:45:16,452
He has some cuteness to him.

680
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:22,055
You were here.

681
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:27,045
I guess I ended up moving back in.

682
00:45:27,045 --> 00:45:31,217
Just don't get in the way.

683
00:45:31,217 --> 00:47:05,925
Okay.

684
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:06,932
Ah, you came?

685
00:47:06,932 --> 00:47:08,483
Why are you still here and not leaving?

686
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:10,483
I was going to go after finishing this.

687
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:12,183
Go upstairs first.

688
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:27,075
Ha Ni, go up.

689
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:29,783
Ha Ni, wait.

690
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:34,183
Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success.

691
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:41,817
Yeah.

692
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,055
Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?

693
00:47:44,055 --> 00:47:46,917
I knew it would be like that, so I made these.

694
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:47,917
Sit down, sit down.

695
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:50,065
Father, sit down please.

696
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:53,217
Here. Look forward to it!

697
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:56,083
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!

698
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:59,075
Bong(?) Dumplings!

699
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:03,983
This is called Bong Dumplings. Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.

700
00:48:03,983 --> 00:48:07,717
I made it after getting special permission from your father.

701
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:09,065
I'm not sure if it turned out well.

702
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:11,317
I have one for Father too.

703
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:15,005
Try it and please critique it.

704
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:18,065
I was waiting so long for you to come home.

705
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:22,717
Yeah.

706
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:25,317
But, what to do?

707
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:26,075
I already ate dinner.

708
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:28,065
Really? You already ate?

709
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:30,983
Ah, what a waste.

710
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:32,617
Dad.

711
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:33,085
Oh.

712
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:36,015
That...

713
00:48:36,015 --> 00:48:38,417
You did quite a good job on the shape.

714
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,025
Does it really look like that?

715
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:42,183
Father, try it once.

716
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:49,017
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.

717
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:50,783
Oh. Joon Gu.

718
00:48:50,783 --> 00:48:53,383
There... um....

719
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:57,065
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.

720
00:48:57,065 --> 00:49:03,317
It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back.

721
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:07,417
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.

722
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,055
We just decided to do it that way.

723
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:11,083
Just know that. Okay?

724
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:15,015
Ah yes, yes.

725
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:19,717
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.

726
00:49:19,717 --> 00:49:22,683
You did well. Good Job.

727
00:49:22,683 --> 00:49:26,183
Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work. So try it at least once.

728
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:27,045
Eat it, okay?

729
00:49:27,045 --> 00:50:02,417
Okay.

730
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,055
<i>I feel sorry towards Joon Gu...

731
00:50:05,055 --> 00:50:10,015
<i>but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again.

732
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:14,917
<i>I'm excited but nervous at the same time.

733
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:21,075
<i>Will I be able to do a good job?

734
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:24,317
Oh. Where did it go?

735
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:46,383
I know I brought it in.

736
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:48,015
Is this yours?

737
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:49,095
Mine.

738
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:50,983
You took it didn't you?

739
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:52,383
Dummy.

740
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,817
It was on the ground right here.

741
00:50:54,817 --> 00:50:57,283
Who would steal childish panties like those?

742
00:50:57,283 --> 00:50:59,517
I only wear them once in a while.

743
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:04,015
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.

744
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:06,075
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.

745
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:08,517
Even the A Cup must be too big...

746
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:11,717
Did you stop growing after elementary school?

747
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:12,683
What did you say?

748
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:13,783
Hey.

749
00:51:13,783 --> 00:51:16,783
Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything...

750
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,005
Isn't that a big problem?

751
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:21,683
Is it that fun to make fun of me?

752
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:25,622
If you don't like living with me, you can just say it.

753
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:27,383
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.

754
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:29,783
I'm grumpy?

755
00:51:29,783 --> 00:51:32,952
Yeah. Why am I doing that?

756
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:37,752
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.

757
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:47,045
But isn't the one with the problem you? You even drop those kinds of things.

758
00:51:47,045 --> 00:51:51,517
It's good that you two have gotten closer...

759
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:55,383
but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful.

760
00:51:55,383 --> 00:52:05,817
Since Eun Jo is here too.

761
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:10,078
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

762
00:52:10,078 --> 00:52:13,513
When are you going to select your major?

763
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:16,426
During my second year.

764
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:19,631
Then, when you decide what major you're going to take...

765
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:20,552
Will you be able to do it?

766
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:24,247
If a bunch of people choose the same major,

767
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:27,913
They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner...

768
00:52:27,913 --> 00:52:30,013
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.

769
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,713
Well, I'm just saying...

770
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:34,313
It would be nice if you went into business.

771
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:36,098
I'm not interested in that area.

772
00:52:36,098 --> 00:52:38,147
Ah, Why?

773
00:52:38,147 --> 00:52:58,913
Please drop me off right over there.

774
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:01,628
Are you going into class?

775
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:11,078
Seung Jo!

776
00:53:11,078 --> 00:53:13,078
Again?

777
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:17,013
Hey, when you think it's going well with him...

778
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:19,047
Why is he so fickle?!

779
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,713
Is he being mean again?

780
00:53:21,713 --> 00:53:26,968
This time, it feels different from the last, though.

781
00:53:26,968 --> 00:53:28,913
I don't know.

782
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:32,013
What- I mean, you said you even kissed.

783
00:53:32,013 --> 00:53:34,313
Like this... you said you hugged too.

784
00:53:34,313 --> 00:53:37,078
But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??

785
00:53:37,078 --> 00:53:42,347
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.

786
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:44,547
It's very frustrating.

787
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:48,713
Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas?

788
00:53:48,713 --> 00:53:56,713
To find out if he's interested in me or not.

789
00:53:56,713 --> 00:54:02,068
Ah, then should we try the "yawning method?"

790
00:54:02,068 --> 00:54:03,713
Yawning method?

791
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:09,078
So, now the word "concluded" is basically the same as "to finish" something.

792
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:15,047
You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded.

793
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:18,058
Now, the second sentence we're going to look at

794
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:23,947
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.

795
00:54:23,947 --> 00:54:27,047
In this particular sentence,

796
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:32,813
<i>Yawning is somewhat contagious. So if you see someone yawn, you find yourself following.

797
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:36,157
<i>Just use that.

798
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:38,047
<i>You yawn during class.

799
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:40,547
<i>But if Seung Jo yawns after you,

800
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:47,313
<i>then that means he has glanced over at you.

801
00:54:47,313 --> 00:54:49,078
<i>If he's not interested, why would he look at you?

802
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:54,038
Yes!!

803
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:57,647
So, you're going to make effort to get it.

804
00:54:57,647 --> 00:55:07,845
They're both advocating a deal, it means they both really want the deal.

805
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:13,065
Is my lesson really that boring guys?

806
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:31,847
It's ruined.

807
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:35,347
I haven't suffered from anything so far.

808
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:38,513
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably.

809
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:41,447
Yeah, You and Me...

810
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:45,113
I just lived off my greatness.

811
00:55:45,113 --> 00:55:49,847
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.

812
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,747
What do we do??

813
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:55,088
It seems we belong together more and more.

814
00:55:55,088 --> 00:56:00,213
That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house.

815
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:02,048
Looking at her...

816
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:07,813
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.

817
00:56:07,813 --> 00:56:14,008
And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong.

818
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:16,213
It was quite surprising

819
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:21,048
So I should experience the world more...

820
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:25,008
I think about it often, lately.

821
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,879
Anyways, thank you He Ra.

822
00:56:28,879 --> 00:56:32,038
That I could talk to someone about this ...

823
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:50,088
It's a relief

824
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:56,028
If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-

825
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:58,513
Hey, Ha Ni ah!

826
00:56:58,513 --> 00:57:03,947
It's good that you came. Come over here.

827
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:07,813
Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'

828
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:09,147
The timing of the kiss

829
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:13,247
I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem.

830
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:15,098
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me." this is 4.3 seconds...

831
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,913
During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then.

832
00:57:17,913 --> 00:57:19,313
You'll have to do it before she leaves.

833
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:20,058
Of course, I have to do it before she leaves.

834
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:22,913
But you see, that timing doesn't really work out.

835
00:57:22,913 --> 00:57:25,098
Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me.

836
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:27,647
EH?! No, I don't want to

837
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:29,113
I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?

838
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,547
Please, do it for me.

839
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,413
I'll do it instead.

840
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:39,943
Ok, then you do it. Stand right here.

841
00:57:39,943 --> 00:57:41,058
It worked well for Seung Jo.

842
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:48,866
When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up .

843
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:56,078
If you can forget me...

844
00:57:56,078 --> 00:57:59,088
You saw that just now, right? The timing wasn't right

845
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,063
Before the conversation is over, he already came it.

846
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:03,028
It's too long, this 4.3 seconds.

847
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,068
Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?

848
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:29,313
When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person. Confidence, and burning eyes.

849
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:40,078
Hae Ra!

850
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:45,088
Oh my god! You startled me

851
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:53,347
Oh, what do we do

852
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:56,347
Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well.

853
00:58:56,347 --> 00:59:05,247
Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to. It's so fun!

854
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:09,913
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves

855
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:13,547
Yes, it's true.

856
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:17,018
Oh, Ha Ni! Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?

857
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:19,048
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.

858
00:59:19,048 --> 00:59:20,613
It seems I have forgotten!

859
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:23,008
Sure, I'll be right back

860
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:25,513
You know that closet towards the inside, right?

861
00:59:25,513 --> 00:59:47,813
I know

862
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:55,713
OH! It's the couples T-shirt!

863
00:59:55,713 --> 01:00:34,088
He still has it.

864
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:41,313
Room for rent

865
01:00:41,313 --> 01:00:47,068
Part time job?

866
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:51,479
What are you doing in someone else's room?

867
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:54,913
You came?

868
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:57,013
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.

869
01:00:57,013 --> 01:00:59,747
Then you should have just gotten it and left. What are you looking through?

870
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:04,647
Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae.

871
01:01:04,647 --> 01:01:07,098
He said that you might even move out of this house.

872
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:10,447
Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?

873
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:14,047
It's true.

874
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:14,068
Huh?

875
01:01:14,068 --> 01:01:17,147
I'm going to leave this house.

876
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:17,068
Why?

877
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:21,058
What do you mean why? Do I need to get your permission for that too?

878
01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:24,513
That's not it....

879
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:29,213
Perhaps, is it because I came in? Are you leaving because of me?

880
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:32,947
Anyways, it has nothing to do with you.

881
01:01:32,947 --> 01:01:35,018
Don't relate everything to yourself.

882
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:38,847
What do you mean you're leaving this house?

883
01:01:38,847 --> 01:01:42,058
Until now, under your supervision...

884
01:01:42,058 --> 01:01:44,613
I have lived comfortably.

885
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:49,213
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.

886
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:53,424
Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job...

887
01:01:53,424 --> 01:01:59,213
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.

888
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:02,647
What kind of person am I?

889
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:07,018
What can I do?

890
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:08,613
Okay.

891
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:10,747
That's not a bad idea.

892
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:13,613
Aigoo, but still...

893
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:16,147
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.

894
01:02:16,147 --> 01:02:16,913
Hey, Seung Jo.

895
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:19,647
It has nothing to do with her.

896
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:24,713
It's my life.

897
01:02:24,713 --> 01:02:26,018
Okay.

898
01:02:26,018 --> 01:02:34,028
Go try it out.

899
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:35,813
<i> What should I do?

900
01:02:35,813 --> 01:02:40,313
<i> Seung Jo is going to move out of this house.

901
01:02:40,313 --> 01:02:43,747
<i> I came back into this house.

902
01:02:43,747 --> 01:02:46,058
<i> But this time, Seung Jo...

903
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:56,364
<i> is going to leave.

904
01:02:56,364 --> 01:03:10,713
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

905
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:14,713
Where is Baek Seung Jo?

906
01:03:14,713 --> 01:03:17,013
If I don't try,

907
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:19,013
We couldn't even meet like this.

908
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:21,058
It's Seung Jo.

909
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:25,028
<i> Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself?

910
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:28,008
<i> In what area are you living right now?

911
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,008
Hey, Baek Seung Jo.

912
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:33,747
Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up.

913
01:03:33,747 --> 01:03:38,047
Tell her like a man.

914
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,513
Seung Jo!

915
01:03:39,513 --> 01:03:40,247
All of a sudden...

916
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:43,008
It must be lonely living by yourself.

917
01:03:43,008 --> 01:03:47,058
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.

918
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:49,413
What? Roomate?!

919
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:50,747
Did something happen?

920
01:03:50,747 --> 99:59:59,999
No, I'm fine.

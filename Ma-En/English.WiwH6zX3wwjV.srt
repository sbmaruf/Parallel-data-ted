1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,017
Let's just do a ton of  more examples,

2
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:07,036
just so we make sure that we're getting this trig function thing down well.

3
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:11,447
So let's construct ourselves some right triangles.

4
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,668
Let's construct ourselves some right triangles,

5
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,186
and I want to be very clear.

6
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:18,042
The way I've defined it so far, this will only work in right triangles.

7
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:23,475
So if you're trying to find the trig functions of angles that aren't part of right triangles,

8
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,704
we're going to see that we're going to have to construct right triangles,

9
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:27,867
but let's just focus on the right triangles for now.

10
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:31,344
So let's say that I have a triangle,

11
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,897
where let's say this length down here is seven,

12
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:37,757
and let's say the length of this side up here,

13
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:39,452
let's say that that is four.

14
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:42,516
Let's figure out what the hypotenuse over here is going to be.

15
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:45,720
So we know -let's call the hypotenuse, "h"-

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,200
we know that h squared is going to be equal to seven squared plus four squared,

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,194
we know that from the Pythagorean theorem,

18
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:57,469
that the hypotenuse squared is equal to

19
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,974
the square of each of the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

20
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,533
h squared is equal to seven squared plus four squared.

21
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:09,776
So this is equal to forty-nine plus sixteen,

22
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,800
forty-nine plus sixteen,

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,553
forty nine plus ten is fifty-nine, plus six is sixty-five.

24
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,107
It is sixty five. So this h squared,

25
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:25,705
let me write: h squared -that's different shade of yellow-

26
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,818
so we have h squared is equal to sixty-five.

27
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:33,533
Did I do that right? Forty nine plus ten is fifty nine, plus another six is sixty-five,

28
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:37,600
or we could say that h is equal to, if we take the square root of both sides,

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
square root

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,933
square root of sixty five. And we really can't simplify
this at all.

31
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,699
This is thirteen.

32
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:47,463
This is the same thing as thirteen times five,

33
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:50,388
both of those are not perfect squares and

34
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,804
they're both prime so you can't simplify this any more.

35
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:55,467
So this is equal to the square root of sixty five.

36
00:01:55,467 --> 00:02:02,114
Now let's find the trig, let's find the trig functions for this angle up here.

37
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:05,457
Let's call that angle up there theta.

38
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:06,533
So whenever you do it

39
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,467
you always want to write down - at least for me it works out to write down -

40
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,714
"soh cah toa".

41
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,120
soh...

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,464
...soh cah toa. I have these vague memories

43
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,786
of my trigonometry teacher.

44
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:21,293
Maybe I've read it in some book. I don't know - you know, some... about

45
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,867
some type of indian princess named "soh cah toa" or whatever,

46
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,123
but it's a very useful mnemonic,

47
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:27,564
so we can apply "soh cah toa".

48
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,046
Let's find, let's say we want to find the cosine.

49
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,436
We want to find the cosine of our angle.

50
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:37,965
We wanna find the cosine of our angle, you say: "soh cah toa!"

51
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,800
So the "cah". "Cah" tells us what to do with cosine,

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,027
the "cah" part tells us

53
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:46,371
that cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

54
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:51,433
Cosine is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse.

55
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:55,798
So let's look over here to theta; what side is adjacent?

56
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,702
Well we know that the hypotenuse,

57
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,767
we know that that hypotenuse is this side over here.

58
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:04,761
So it can't be that side. The only other side that's kind of adjacent to it that

59
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:07,133
isn't the hypotenuse,  is this four.

60
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:10,473
So the adjacent side over here, that side is,

61
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:14,374
it's literally right next to the angle,

62
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:15,754
it's one of the sides that kind of forms the angle

63
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:17,133
it's four over the hypotenuse.

64
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:21,108
The hypotenuse we already know is square root
of sixty-five.

65
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:25,380
so it's four over the square root of sixty-five.

66
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,142
And sometimes people will want you to rationalize the denominator which means

67
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,625
they don't like to have an irrational number in the denominator,

68
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,227
like the square root of sixty five,

69
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:39,359
and if they - if you wanna rewrite this without a irrational number in the denominator,

70
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,634
you can multiply the numerator and the denominator

71
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,306
by the square root of sixty-five.

72
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,094
This clearly will not change the number,

73
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,122
because we're multiplying it by something over itself,

74
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:49,111
so we're multiplying the number by one.

75
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:52,780
That won't change the number, but at least it gets rid of the irrational number in the denominator.

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,127
So the numerator becomes

77
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:57,800
four times the square root of sixty-five,

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,461
and the denominator, square root of 65 times square root of 65, is just going to be 65.

79
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:07,130
We didn't get rid of the irrational number, it's still there, but it's now in the numerator.

80
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,777
Now let's do the other trig functions

81
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:12,401
or at least the other core trig functions.

82
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,399
We'll learn in the future that there's actually a ton of them

83
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,443
but they're all derived from these.

84
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:19,733
so let's think about what the sign of theta is. Once again
 go to "soh cah toa".

85
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:25,474
The "soh" tells what to do with  sine.  Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

86
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,200
Sine is equal to opposite over hypotenuse.

87
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,372
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

88
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,390
So for this angle what side is opposite?

89
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,430
We just go opposite it, what it opens into, it's opposite the seven

90
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,200
so the opposite side is the seven.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,468
This is, right here - that is the opposite side

92
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:47,800
and then the hypotenuse, it's opposite over hypotenuse.

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,109
The hypotenuse is the square root of sixty-five.

94
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,966
Square root of sixty-five.

95
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,133
and once again if we wanted to rationalize this,

96
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:59,933
we could multiply times the square root of 65 over the square root of 65

97
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:04,298
and the the numerator, we will get seven square root of 65

98
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:07,966
and in the denominator we will get just sixty-five again.

99
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:10,474
Now let's do tangent!

100
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:12,796
Let us do tangent.

101
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,793
So if i ask you the tangent

102
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,394
of - the tangent of theta

103
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:20,784
once again go back to "soh cah toa".

104
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:23,106
The toa part tells us what to do with tangent

105
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,800
it tells us...

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,053
it tells us that tangent

107
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,867
is equal to opposite over adjacent

108
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:33,137
is equal to opposite over

109
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:35,867
opposite over adjacent

110
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,709
So for this angle, what is opposite? We've already figured it out.

111
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,124
it's seven. It opens into the seven.

112
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,533
It is opposite the seven.

113
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,372
So it's seven over what side is adjacent.

114
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:48,200
well this four is adjacent.

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,295
This four is adjacent. So the adjacent side is four.

116
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:54,330
so it's seven over four,

117
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,133
and we're done.

118
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:59,375
We figured out all of the trig ratios for theta. let's do another one.

119
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,416
Let's do another one.

120
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,719
i'll make it a little bit concrete 'cause right now we've been saying,

121
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,434
"oh, what's tangent of x, tangent of theta." let's make it a little bit more concrete.

122
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,431
Let's say...

123
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,799
let's say, let me draw another right triangle,

124
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,772
that's another right triangle here.

125
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:17,533
Everything we're dealing with, these are going to be right triangles.

126
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,109
let's say the hypotenuse has length four,

127
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:26,357
let's say that this side over here has length two,

128
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:31,790
and let's say that this length over here is going to be two times the square root of three.

129
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,462
We can verify that this works.

130
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,467
If you have this side squared, so you have - let me write it down -

131
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,803
two times the square root of three squared

132
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:42,471
plus two squared, is equal to what?

133
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:46,467
this is two. There's going to be four times three.

134
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:49,763
four times three plus four,

135
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:53,478
and this is going to be equal to twelve plus four is equal to sixteen

136
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,800
and sixteen is indeed four squared. So this does equal four squared,

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,790
it does equal four squared. It satisfies the pythagorean theorem

138
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,133
and if you remember some of your work from 30 60 90 triangles

139
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,781
that you might have learned in geometry,

140
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:11,450
you might recognize that this is a 30 60 90 triangle.

141
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,133
This right here is our right angle,

142
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,867
- i should have drawn it from the get go to show that this is a right triangle -

143
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:20,366
this angle right over here is our thirty degree angle

144
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,385
and then this angle up here,  this angle up here is

145
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:26,125
a sixty degree angle,

146
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,797
and it's a thirty sixteen ninety because

147
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,791
the side opposite the thirty degrees is half the hypotenuse

148
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,800
and then the side opposite the 60 degrees is a squared of 3 times the other side

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,432
that's not the hypotenuse.

150
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,159
So that said, we're not gonna ...

151
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,415
this isn't supposed to be a review of 30 60 90 triangles although i just did it.

152
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:46,933
Let's actually find the trig ratios for the different angles.

153
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:51,295
So if i were to ask you or if anyone were to ask you, what is...

154
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,639
what is the sine of thirty degrees?

155
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,447
and remember 30 degrees is one of the angles in this triangle but it would apply

156
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:01,698
whenever you have a 30 degree angle and you're dealing with the right triangle.

157
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:05,135
We'll have broader definitions in the future but if you say sine of thirty degrees,

158
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:09,035
hey, this angle right over here is thirty degrees so i can use this right triangle,

159
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,133
and we just have to remember "soh cah toa"

160
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:17,116
We rewrite it. soh, cah, toa.

161
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:22,782
"sine tells us" (correction). soh tells us what to do with sine. sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

162
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:26,358
sine of thirty degrees is the opposite side,

163
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:30,723
that is the opposite side which is two over the hypotenuse.

164
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,395
The hypotenuse here is four.

165
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:35,646
it is two fourths which is the same thing as one-half.

166
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:40,800
sine of  thirty degrees you'll see is always going to be equal to one-half.

167
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,144
now what is the cosine?

168
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,867
What is the cosine of thirty degrees?

169
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:50,135
Once again go back to "soh cah toa".

170
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,643
The cah tells us what to do with cosine.

171
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:56,033
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

172
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,051
So for looking at the thirty degree angle it's the adjacent.

173
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:01,791
This, right over here is adjacent. it's right next to it.

174
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,467
it's not the hypotenuse. it's the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

175
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:09,129
so it's two square roots of three

176
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,633
adjacent over...over the hypotenuse, over four.

177
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,977
or if we simplify that, we divide the numerator and the denominator by two

178
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:20,646
it's the square root of three over two.

179
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,782
Finally, let's do the tangent.

180
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:27,800
The tangent of thirty degrees,

181
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,305
we go back to "soh cah toa".

182
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,699
soh cah toa

183
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:34,800
toa tells us what to do with tangent. It's opposite over adjacent

184
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,804
you go to the 30 degree angle because that's what we care about, tangent of 30.

185
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:42,101
tangent of thirty. Opposite is two,

186
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:46,200
opposite is two and the adjacent is two square roots of three.

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,045
It's right next to it. It's adjacent to it.

188
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,439
adjacent means next to.

189
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,039
so two square roots of three

190
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,454
so this is equal to... the twos cancel out

191
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:56,776
one over the square root of three

192
00:09:56,776 --> 00:10:00,723
or we could multiply the numerator and the denominator by the square root of three.

193
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:05,367
So we have square root of three over square root of three

194
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:08,804
and so this is going to be equal to the numerator square root of three and then

195
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:12,473
the denominator right over here is just going to be three.

196
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:15,800
So that we've rationalized a square root of three over three.

197
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,442
Fair enough.

198
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,693
Now lets use the same triangle to figure out the trig ratios for the sixty degrees,

199
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,457
since we've already drawn it.

200
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:28,328
so what is... what is the sine of the sixty degrees?

201
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,166
and i think you're hopefully getting the hang of it now.

202
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,253
Sine is opposite over adjacent. soh from the "soh cah toa".

203
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,668
for the sixty degree angle what side is opposite?

204
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,315
what opens out into the two square roots of three,

205
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:42,566
so the opposite side is two square roots of three,

206
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,306
and from the sixty degree angle the adj-oh sorry

207
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,999
its the opposite over hypotenuse, don't want to confuse you.

208
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,507
so it is opposite over hypotenuse

209
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:54,315
so it's two square roots of three over four. four is the hypotenuse.

210
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:59,981
so it is equal to, this simplifies to square root of three over two.

211
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:05,507
What is the cosine of sixty degrees? cosine of sixty degrees.

212
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:10,244
so remember "soh cah toa". cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

213
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,667
adjacent is the two sides, right next to the sixty degree angle.

214
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:17,907
So it's two over the hypotenuse which is four.

215
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:20,972
So this is equal to one-half

216
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,176
and then finally, what is the tangent?

217
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:27,984
what is the tangent of sixty degrees?

218
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:32,349
Well tangent, "soh cah toa". Tangent is opposite over adjacent

219
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:34,671
opposite the sixty degrees

220
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:36,400
is two square roots of three

221
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
two square roots of three

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,919
and adjacent to that

223
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,733
adjacent to that is two.

224
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,800
Adjacent to sixty degrees is two.

225
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,650
So its opposite over adjacent, two square roots of three over two

226
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,644
which is just equal to the square root of three.

227
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,641
And I just wanted to -look how these are related-

228
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,984
the sine of thirty degrees is the same as the cosine of sixty degrees.

229
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,333
The cosine of 30 degrees is the same thing as the sine of 60 degrees

230
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,966
and then these guys are the inverse of each other

231
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,635
and i think if you think a little bit about this triangle

232
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:07,105
it will start to make sense why.

233
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,461
we'll keep extending
this and

234
00:12:08,461 --> 99:59:59,000
give you a lot more practice in the next few videos.

1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,420
Jamir is training for a
race and is running

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,170
laps around a field.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,430
If the distance around the field
is 300 yards, how many

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:17,930
complete laps would he need to
do to run at least 2 miles?

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,272
So they tell us how far one lap
is, it's 300 yards, but we

6
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,310
need to figure out how many
laps to go 2 miles.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,460
So a good starting point would
be to get everything into the

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,190
same units.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,020
We have distance here in terms
of miles, we have it here in

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,130
terms of yards.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,960
So let's just get everything
into yards.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,470
So he needs to run 2 miles.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,450
How do we convert
that to yards?

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,820
Well, I don't have it memorized
how many yards there

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,040
are per mile, but I do have it
memorized how many feet there

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,710
are per mile.

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,060
And it's a good thing to have
in the back of your brain

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,040
someplace, that in general you
have 5,280 feet per mile.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,930
It's a good number to know.

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,740
5,280 feet per mile.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,530
So if we want to convert, we can
first convert the miles to

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,050
feet, and then we know that
there are 3 feet per yard, and

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,770
then we'll have 2 miles
in terms of yards.

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,930
So 2 miles, if we want it
converted to feet, we want

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,650
miles in the denominator and we
want feet in the numerator.

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,450
And the reason why I say that
is so that this miles will

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,850
cancel out with that
miles, and we'll

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,050
just have feet there.

29
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:28,460
And I just wrote down, there's
5,280 feet per mile, or you

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,810
say 5,280 feet for
every 1 mile.

31
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,390
You can write it either
way, but let's just

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,490
write it like that.

33
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,770
And then we can multiply.

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,460
So this is going to
give us what?

35
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,340
If we just multiply the
numbers 2 times 5,280.

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,310
So what is that going to be?

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,820
Maybe I should get
a calculator out.

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,130
Or we could do that
in our head.

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,710
Let's think of it this way:
2 times 80 is 160.

40
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,990
2 times 200 is 400.

41
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,140
So it's going to be 400 plus
160 is going to be 560.

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,940
And then 2 times 5,000
thousand is 10,000.

43
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,140
So it's 10,560.

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,590
And then the miles cancel
out, and we are

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,020
just left with feet.

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,630
And let me actually
multiply it out.

47
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,900
I did it in my head that time,
but that's not always useful.

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,350
Let me verify for
you that 5,280

49
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,080
times 2 is indeed 10,560.

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,010
So 2 times 0 is 0.

51
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,400
2 times 8 is 16.

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,500
Carry the 1.

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,920
2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is 5.

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
2 times 5 is 10.

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,190
10,560.

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,670
So he needs to run
10,560 feet.

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,070
Now, we want this in
terms of yards.

58
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,320
So 10,560 feet.

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,620
Let's convert this to yards.

60
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,860
Well, we want it in yards.

61
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,300
So we want yards in the
numerator, and we want feet in

62
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,900
the denominator, so that the
feet cancel out with that feet

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,210
right there.

64
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,185
And we know that there are
3 feet for every 1 yard.

65
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,450
Or another way to read this is
that you have 1/3 of a yard

66
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,730
for every foot.

67
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,760
And now we can multiply.

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,590
And it makes sense.

69
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,330
If you're going from feet to
yards, the number should get

70
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,720
smaller because yards
is a bigger unit.

71
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,970
You need fewer yards to go the
same distance as a certain

72
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,730
number of feet.

73
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,770
So it makes sense that
we're dividing.

74
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,740
Same thing: 2 miles is a ton of
feet, so it made sense that

75
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,760
we were multiplying
by a large number.

76
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,720
Here it makes sense that
we're dividing.

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,970
So let's do this.

78
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,900
So this becomes 10,560
times 1 divided by 3.

79
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,670
So it's 10,560/3.

80
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,220
That's that and that part.

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,570
And then the feet cancel
out, and we are

82
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,170
just left with yards.

83
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,760
So 2 miles is 10,560
divided by 3.

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,310
And let's figure out
what that is.

85
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,090
So 3 goes into 10,560.

86
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,460
It doesn't go into 1.

87
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,280
It goes into 10 three times.

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,140
3 times 3 is 9.

89
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,589
And we subtract.

90
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,630
We get 1.

91
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,910
Bring down this 5.

92
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,209
It becomes a 15.

93
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,190
3 goes into 15 five times.

94
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,380
5 times 3 is 15.

95
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,890
We have no remainder, or 0.

96
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,220
You bring down the 6.

97
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,290
3 goes into 6 two times.

98
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,980
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

99
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,740
2 times 3 is 6.

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,590
Subtract.

101
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,620
No remainder.

102
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,430
Bring down this last 0.

103
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,000
3 goes into 0 zero times.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,920
0 times 3 is 0.

105
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,150
And we have no remainder.

106
00:04:49,150 --> 00:05:00,090
So 2 miles is the equivalent
to 3,520 yards.

107
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,150
That's the total distance
he has to travel.

108
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,680
That's the equivalent
of 2 miles.

109
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,770
Now we want to figure out
how many laps there are.

110
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,820
We want this in terms of laps,
not in terms of yards.

111
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,070
So we want the yards
to cancel out.

112
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,590
And we want laps in the
numerator, right?

113
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,690
Because when you multiply, the
yards will cancel out, and

114
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,630
we'll just be left with laps.

115
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,910
Now, how many laps are there
per yard or yards per lap?

116
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,600
Well, they say the distance
around the field is 300 yards.

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,530
So we have 300 yards
for every 1 lap.

118
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,900
So now, multiply this
right here.

119
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,400
The yards will cancel out,
and we will get 3,520.

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,480
Let me do that in a
different color.

121
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,460
We will get 3,520, that right
there, times 1/300.

122
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,020
When you multiply it times
1, it just becomes

123
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,860
3,520 divided by 300.

124
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,550
And in terms of the units,
the yards canceled out.

125
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,430
We're just left with the laps.

126
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,820
So this is how many laps
he needs to run.

127
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,700
So 3,520 divided by 300.

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,450
Well, we can eyeball
this right here.

129
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,170
What is 11 times 300?

130
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,830
Let's just approximate
this right here.

131
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,100
So if we did 11 times
300, what is that

132
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,580
going to be equal to?

133
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,700
Well, 11 times 3 is 33, and then
we have two zeroes here.

134
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,270
So this will be 3,300.

135
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,250
So it's a little bit
smaller than that.

136
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,850
If we have 12 times 300, what
is that going to be?

137
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:41,110
12 times 3 is 36, and then we
have these two zeroes, so it's

138
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,490
equal to 3,600.

139
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,680
So this is going to be
11 point something.

140
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,540
It's larger than 11, right?

141
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,130
3,520 is larger than 3,300.

142
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,140
So when you divide by 300 you're
going to get something

143
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,740
larger than 11.

144
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,280
But this number right here is
smaller than 3,600 so when you

145
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,110
divide it by 300, you're going
to get something a little bit

146
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,420
smaller than 12.

147
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,800
So the exact number of laps is
going to be a little bit lower

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,570
than 12 laps.

149
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,620
So 2 miles is a little bit
lower than 12 laps.

150
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,820
But let's make sure we're
answering their question.

151
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,170
How many complete laps would
he need to do to

152
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,560
run at least 2 miles?

153
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,190
So they're telling us that,
look, this might be, 11 point

154
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,870
something, something,
something laps.

155
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,930
That would be the exact number
of laps to run 2 miles.

156
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,170
But they say how many complete
laps does he have to run?

157
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,240
11 complete laps would
not be enough.

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,820
He would have to run 12.

159
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,470
So our answer here is
12 complete laps.

160
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,980
That complete tells us
that they want a

161
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,310
whole number of laps.

162
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,730
We can't just divide this.

163
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,690
If we divide this, we're going
to get some 11 point

164
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,310
something, something.

165
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,420
You can do with the calculator
or do it by hand if you're

166
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,070
interested.

167
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,720
But we have to do at least 12
because that's the smallest

168
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,280
whole number of laps that will
get us to at least this

169
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,020
distance right here, or this
number of laps, or the

170
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,400
equivalent of 2 miles.

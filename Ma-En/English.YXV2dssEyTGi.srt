1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,740
We're asked, how many inches
are in 4 and 1/2 yards?

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,106
And we'll do it
a couple of ways.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,830
One, we could just say how
many inches are in 4 yards

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,620
and how many inches
are in a 1/2 of a yard?

5
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,911
And this really
4 plus 1/2 yards.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,170
Or we could convert this
into an improper fraction

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,160
first and then convert.

8
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,699
But before I even
do that, let's just

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,040
think about how many
inches there are in a yard.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,110
So if I have 1 yard,
we know that there

11
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:30,016
are 3 feet for
every 1 yard, Right?

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,870
And when you say, why am
I multiplying by 3 instead

13
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,805
of saying there's 1
yard for every 3 feet?

14
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,762
And the easiest way to
think about it is you're

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,250
going to have a larger
value over here,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,340
and you're also going to want
to have these units right

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,230
over here cancel out.

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,610
So yard is canceling
out with yard.

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,820
So you have 1 yard is
equal to 3 feet, which

20
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,147
is kind of what we already knew.

21
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,370
I'm just showing you how
the dimensions cancel out.

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,340
And how many inches
are there per foot?

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,980
Well, we know that there are
12 inches for every 1 foot.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,830
And same logic over here,
inches is a smaller unit

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,570
of measurement so it makes sense
that we're multiplying by 12.

26
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:11,994
3 feet is going
to be more inches,

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,970
so we're multiplying by 12.

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,610
And also these
units cancel out--

29
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,970
foot in the numerator,
foot in the denominator.

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,600
3 times 12 divided by 1
is equal to 36 inches.

31
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:24,062
So you might have
already known it.

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,140
But this is nice to have
the dimensions cancel out

33
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:26,923
like this.

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,970
We know that 1 yard
is equal to 36 inches.

35
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,990
Or there are 36 inches
for every 1 yard.

36
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,540
And so we can now
either break this down,

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,610
or we can turn this into
an improper fraction.

38
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,670
First I'll just break it down
into 4 yards plus 1/2 yards.

39
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,790
So we could say that
this is 4 yards.

40
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,650
So 4 yards is going
to be equal to-- well,

41
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,030
let's just multiply
it times 36 inches,

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,140
36 inches for every 1 yard.

43
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,660
The yards cancel out.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:04,910
4 times 36 is 120,
plus 24, so that's 144.

45
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,720
So this is equal to 144 inches.

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,690
That's just the 4 yards.

47
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,110
And then if we do the 1/2
yards, so 1/2 of a-- I

48
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,410
guess I say 1/2
yard, once again,

49
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,850
times 36 inches per yard,
the yards cancel out.

50
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,800
1/2 times 36 is going to
be equal to 18 inches.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,510
So 4 and 1/2 yards
is the same thing

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,620
as 4 yards plus 1/2 yards, which
is the same thing as 144 inches

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,960
plus 18 inches, which is
going to give us-- let's just

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,700
add it up over
here on the right,

55
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,770
144 plus 18.

56
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,240
4 plus 8 is 12.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,790
4 plus 1 is 5.

58
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,110
You have this 1 up here, so
it's 6, and then we have a 1.

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,070
So when you add them all
together, you get 162 inches.

60
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:00,532
The other way to
do this would have

61
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,680
been to convert this
into an improper fraction

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,980
and then multiply by the unit.

63
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,520
So let's do it that way.

64
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,130
If I have 4 and 1/2 of
anything, really-- so

65
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,580
let me write 4 and 1/2.

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,410
I'm trying to find
a suitable color.

67
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,460
So if I have 4 and 1/2,
this is the same thing--

68
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,360
4 is the same thing as 8/2.

69
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:20,572
This is the same thing-- so
let me write it this way.

70
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,250
4 and 1/2 is the same
thing as 4 plus 1/2,

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,930
which is the same
thing as-- if we

72
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,030
want to have the same
denominator as this 2

73
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,420
over here or as
this 1/2 over here,

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,980
this is the same thing as 8/2.

75
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,700
Or you could say 4/1 is
the same thing as 8/2,

76
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,180
if we want to have a common
denominator, so 8/2 plus 1/2.

77
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,430
Actually, let me write it
that way, just so you really

78
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,000
understand what we're doing.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,680
4 is the same thing as 4/1.

80
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,750
So it's 4/1 plus 1/2.

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,700
If we want to find a
common denominator, it's 2.

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,870
So 4/1 is the same
thing as 8/2 plus 1/2,

83
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,190
which is equal to 9/2.

84
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,090
Now, I did it this way,
which takes longer,

85
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,310
just so you really understand
how we converted it,

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,680
why it makes-- hopefully
conceptually why it just makes

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,100
intuitive sense, why 4 and
1/2 is the same thing as 9/2.

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,810
But if you want a
simple process for it,

89
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,980
you could just say,
look, 4 times 2 is 8.

90
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,705
8 plus 1 is 9.

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,480
And that gives you that 9
right over there, so 9/2.

92
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,730
So we have 9/2 yards that we
want to convert to inches.

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,610
Same process-- times
36 inches per yard.

94
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,760
Yard in the numerator,
yard in the denominator.

95
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,400
We are left with 9/2 times 36.

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,070
We could say times 36/1 if we
like, 36 Inches for every 1

97
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,060
yard.

98
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,470
36-- or the number 36
really is the same as 36/1.

99
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,420
And then we're left with
just inches in our units.

100
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,980
We're just left with inches.

101
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,780
And over here there's several
ways that we can simplify it.

102
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,100
Probably the easiest
way to simplify it is we

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,690
can divide both our numerator
and our denominator by 2.

104
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:04,864
So let me write it this way.

105
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,990
I don't want to skip steps.

106
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:11,645
So we have 9 times 36 over
2 times 1, or over 2 inches.

107
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,775
And we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

108
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,880
by 2 to simplify it.

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,450
They're both divisible by 2.

110
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:20,616
36 divided by 2 is 18.

111
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,500
2 divided by 2 is 1.

112
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,310
So we're really just left
with 9 times 18 inches.

113
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,830
We can just multiply 9 times 18.

114
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,360
Let me do it over here.

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,990
18 times 9.

116
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,430
8 times 9 is 72.

117
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,620
1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is
16, so we get 162 inches.

118
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,940
So all of this simplifies to
162 inches, and we are done.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,340
Find the slope of the line
pictured on the graph.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:11,160
So the slope of a line is
defined to be rise over run.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:22,020
Or you could also view it as
change in y over change in x.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,450
And let me show you
what that means.

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,120
So let's start at some
arbitrary point on this line,

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,320
and they highlight
some of these points.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,570
So let's start at one of
these points right over here.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,020
So if we wanted to start one
of these points-- and let's

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,840
say we want to change our x
in the positive direction.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,220
So we want to go to the right.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,160
So let's say we want
to go from this point

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
to this point over here.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,830
How much do we
have to move in x?

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,277
So if we want to move in x,
we have to go from this point

16
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:48,860
to this point.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,970
We're going from
negative 3 to 0.

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,580

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,370
So our change in x-- and
this triangle, that's delta.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,580
That means "change in."

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,600
Our change in x is equal to 3.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,960

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,830
So what was our change in y when
our change in x is equal to 3?

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,840
Well, when we moved from
this point to this point,

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,370
our x-value changed by 3, but
what happened to our y-value?

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,140
Well, our y-value went down.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,840
It went from positive
3 to positive 2.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,880
Our y-value went down by 1.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,350
So our change in y is
equal to negative 1.

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,290
So we rose negative 1.

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,570
We actually went down.

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,430
So our rise is
negative 1 when our

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,890
run-- when our
change in x-- is 3.

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,850
So change in y over change
in x is negative 1 over 3,

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,710
or we could say that our
slope is negative 1/3.

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,800
Let me scroll over a little bit.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,270
It is negative 1/3.

38
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,980
And I want to show you that we
can do this with any two points

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,010
on the line.

40
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,990
We could even go further
than 3 in the x-direction.

41
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,190
So let's go the other way.

42
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,690
Let's start at this
point right over

43
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,550
here and then move backwards
to this point over here,

44
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,180
just to show you that we'll
still get the same result.

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,780
So to go from this point to that
point, what is our change in x?

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,870
So our change in x is
this right over here.

47
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,260
Our change in x is that
distance right over there.

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,120
We started at 3, and
we went to negative 3.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
We went back 6.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
Over here, our change in
x is equal to negative 6.

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,800
We're starting at
this point now.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,780
So over here our change
in x is negative 6.

53
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,970
And then when our change
in x is negative 6, when

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,660
we start at this
point and we move 6

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,330
back, what is our change
of y to get to that point?

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,570
Well, our y-value went from 1.

57
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,290
That was our y-value
at this point.

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,955
And then when we go back to
this point, our y-value is 3.

59
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:52,901

60
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:53,650
So what did we do?

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,160
We moved up by 2.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,775
Our change in y is equal to 2.

63
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:02,050

64
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,890
Slope is change in y over
change in x, or rise over run.

65
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,690
Change in y is just rise.

66
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,580
Change in x is
just run, how much

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,480
you're moving in the
horizontal direction.

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,240
So rise over run in this
example right over here

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,880
is going to be 2
over negative 6,

70
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,229
which is the same
thing as negative 1/3.

71
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:24,770
And you could verify
it for yourself.

72
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,228
Take any of these
two points, start

73
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:28,150
at one of these two
points, and figure out

74
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,870
what is the run to
get to the next point,

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,130
and then what is the rise
to get the next point.

76
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,149
And for any line, the
slope won't change.

77
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:35,940
Let me do it again.

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,320
Over here, we had to move in the
positive 3 direction, so that

79
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,370
is our run.

80
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,420
So this right here
is positive 3.

81
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,100
That's our run.

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,377
But what's our rise?

83
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:48,710
Well, we actually went down,
so we have a negative rise.

84
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,270
Our rise is negative 1.

85
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,420
So we have negative
1 as our rise.

86
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,490
We went down.

87
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,340
And our run was positive 3.

88
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,345
So our slope here
is negative 1/3.

89
00:03:58,345 --> 00:03:59,234

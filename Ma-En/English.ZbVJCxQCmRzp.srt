1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,100
Before I dive into the mechanics
of how cells divide,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,810
I think it could be useful to
talk a little bit about a lot

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,730
of the vocabulary that
surrounds DNA.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,300
There's a lot of words and some
of them kind of sound

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,520
like each other, but they
can be very confusing.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,600
So the first few I'd like to
talk about is just about how

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,240
DNA either generates more DNA,
makes copies of itself, or how

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,580
it essentially makes proteins,
and we've talked about this in

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,220
the DNA video.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,340
So let's say I have a little--
I'm just going to draw a small

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,705
section of DNA.

12
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:37,740
I have an A, a G, a T, let's say
I have two T's and then I

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,930
have two C's.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,000
Just some small section.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,400
It keeps going.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,010
And, of course, it's
a double helix.

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,440
It has its corresponding
bases.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,780
Let me do that in this color.

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,390
So A corresponds to T, G with
C, it forms hydrogen bonds

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:01,320
with C, T with A, T with
A, C with G, C with G.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
And then, of course,
it just keeps

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,480
going on in that direction.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,770
So there's a couple of different
processes that this

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,310
DNA has to do.

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,440
One is when you're just dealing
with your body cells

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,630
and you need to make more
versions of your skin cells,

27
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,550
your DNA has to copy itself,
and this process is called

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,510
replication.

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,920
You're replicating the DNA.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,190
So let me do replication.

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,660
So how can this DNA
copy itself?

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,750
And this is one of the beautiful
things about how DNA

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,320
is structured.

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,770
Replication.

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,120
So I'm doing a gross
oversimplification, but the

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,600
idea is these two strands
separate, and it doesn't

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
happen on its own.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,510
It's facilitated by a bunch of
proteins and enzymes, but I'll

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,520
talk about the details of the

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,610
microbiology in a future video.

41
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,744
So these guys separate
from each other.

42
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:57,280
Let me put it up here.

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,590
They separate from each other.

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,190
Let me take the other guy.

45
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,710
Too big.

46
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,430
That guy looks something
like that.

47
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,050
They separate from each other,
and then once they've

48
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,680
separated from each other,
what could happen?

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,950
Let me delete some of that
stuff over here.

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,900
Delete that stuff right there.

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,600
So you have this double helix.

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,410
They were all connected.

53
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,230
They're base pairs.

54
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,980
Now, they separate
from each other.

55
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,010
Now once they separate, what
can each of these do?

56
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,500
They can now become the template
for each other.

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,410
If this guy is sitting by
himself, now all of a sudden,

58
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,750
a thymine base might come and
join right here, so these

59
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,110
nucleotides will start
lining up.

60
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,640
So you'll have a thymine and a
cytosine, and then an adenine,

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,750
adenine, guanine, guanine,
and it'll keep happening.

62
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,835
And then on this other part,
this other green strand that

63
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,210
was formerly attached to this
blue strand, the same thing

64
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,970
will happen.

65
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,670
You have an adenine, a guanine,
thymine, thymine,

66
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,770
cytosine, cytosine.

67
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,550
So what just happened?

68
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,460
By separating and then just
attracting their complementary

69
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,670
bases, we just duplicated
this molecule, right?

70
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,280
We'll do the microbiology of it
in the future, but this is

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,030
just to get the idea.

72
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,370
This is how the DNA makes
copies of itself.

73
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,190
And especially when we talk
about mitosis and meiosis, I

74
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,030
might say, oh, this is the stage
where the replication

75
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,280
has occurred.

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,460
Now, the other thing that
you'll hear a lot, and I

77
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,900
talked about this in the DNA
video, is transcription.

78
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,000
In the DNA video, I didn't focus
much on how does DNA

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,730
duplicate itself, but one of
the beautiful things about

80
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,420
this double helix design is
it really is that easy to

81
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,160
duplicate itself.

82
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,670
You just split the two strips,
the two helices, and then they

83
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,760
essentially become a template
for the other one, and then

84
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,410
you have a duplicate.

85
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,200
Now, transcription is what needs
to occur for this DNA

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,380
eventually to turn into
proteins, but transcription is

87
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,870
the intermediate step.

88
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,280
It's the step where you
go from DNA to mRNA.

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,930
And then that mRNA leaves the
nucleus of the cell and goes

90
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,810
out to the ribosomes, and I'll
talk about that in a second.

91
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,810
So we can do the same thing.

92
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,760
So this guy, once again
during transcription,

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,120
will also split apart.

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,970
So that was one split there and
then the other split is

95
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,220
right there.

96
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,240
And actually, maybe it makes
more sense just to do one-half

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
of it, so let me delete that.

98
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,730
Let's say that we're just going
to transcribe the green

99
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,010
side right here.

100
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,695
Let me erase all this stuff
right-- nope, wrong color.

101
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:52,530
Let me erase this stuff
right here.

102
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:59,860
Now, what happens is instead
of having deoxyribonucleic

103
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,030
acid nucleotides pair up with
this DNA strand, you have

104
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,950
ribonucleic acid, or RNA
pair up with this.

105
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,620
And I'll do RNA in magneta.

106
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,130
So the RNA will pair
up with it.

107
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,480
And so thymine on the DNA side
will pair up with adenine.

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,810
Guanine, now, when we talk about
RNA, instead of thymine,

109
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,160
we have uracil, uracil,
cytosine, cytosine, and it

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
just keeps going.

111
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,330
This is mRNA.

112
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,070
Now, this separates.

113
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,950
That mRNA separates, and
it leaves the nucleus.

114
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,490
It leaves the nucleus, and then
you have translation.

115
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,790
That is going from the mRNA to--
you remember in the DNA

116
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,280
video, I had the little tRNA.

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,650
The transfer RNA were kind of
the trucks that drove up the

118
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,100
amino acids to the mRNA, and
this all occurs inside these

119
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,150
parts of the cell called
the ribosome.

120
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,030
But the translation is
essentially going from the

121
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:16,710
mRNA to the proteins, and we
saw how that happened.

122
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,560
You have this guy-- let
me make a copy here.

123
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
Let me actually copy
the whole thing.

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:32,980
This guy separates, leaves the
nucleus, and then you had

125
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,060
those little tRNA trucks that
essentially drive up.

126
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,820
So maybe I have some tRNA.

127
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,420
Let's see, adenine, adenine,
guanine, and guanine.

128
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,430
This is tRNA.

129
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,230
That's a codon.

130
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,650
A codon has three base pairs,
and attached to it, it has

131
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,540
some amino acid.

132
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,750
And then you have some
other piece of tRNA.

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,890
Let's say it's a uracil,
cytosine, adenine.

134
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,305
And attached to that, it has
a different amino acid.

135
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,530
Then the amino acids attach to
each other, and then they form

136
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,365
this long chain of amino acids,
which is a protein, and

137
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:12,840
the proteins form these weird
and complicated shapes.

138
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,080
So just to kind of make sure you
understand, so if we start

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,510
with DNA, and we're essentially
making copies of

140
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,790
DNA, this is replication.

141
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,430
You're replicating the DNA.

142
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,270
Now, if you're starting with DNA
and you are creating mRNA

143
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,006
from the DNA template, this
is transcription.

144
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,160
You are transcribing the
information from one form to

145
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,830
another: transcription.

146
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,520
Now, when the mRNA leaves the
nucleus of the cell, and I've

147
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,200
talked-- well, let me just draw
a cell just to hit the

148
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,100
point home, if this is a whole
cell, and we'll do the

149
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,090
structure of a cell
in the future.

150
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,870
If that's the whole cell, the
nucleus is the center.

151
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,380
That's where all the DNA is
sitting in there, and all of

152
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,500
the replication and the
transcription occurs in here,

153
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,310
but then the mRNA leaves the
cell, and then inside the

154
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,270
ribosomes, which we'll talk
about more in the future, you

155
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,470
have translation occur and
the proteins get formed.

156
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:29,430
So mRNA to protein
is translation.

157
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,230
You're translating from the
genetic code, so to speak, to

158
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,809
the protein code.

159
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,059
So this is translation.

160
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,030
So these are just good words to
make sure you get clear and

161
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,290
make sure you're using the right
word when you're talking

162
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,660
about the different processes.

163
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,560
Now, the other part of the
vocabulary of DNA, which, when

164
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,250
I first learned it, I found
tremendously confusing, are

165
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,600
the words chromosome.

166
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
I'll write them down here
because you can already

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,100
appreciate how confusing
they are: chromosome,

168
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,590
chromatin and chromatid.

169
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,210
So a chromosome, we already
talked about.

170
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,760
You can have DNA.

171
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,880
You can have a strand of DNA.

172
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,530
That's a double helix.

173
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,470
This strand, if I were to zoom
in, is actually two different

174
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,910
helices, and, of course,
they have their base

175
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,140
pairs joined up.

176
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,730
I'll just draw some base pairs
joined up like that.

177
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,470
So I want to be clear, when I
draw this little green line

178
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,630
here, it's actually
a double helix.

179
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,340
Now, that double helix gets
wrapped around proteins that

180
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,590
are called histones.

181
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,660
So let's say it gets wrapped
like there, and it gets

182
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,000
wrapped around like that, and
it gets wrapped around like

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,480
that, and you have here these
things called histones, which

184
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,730
are these proteins.

185
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:12,890
Now, this structure, when you
talk about the DNA in

186
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,040
combination with the proteins
that kind of give it structure

187
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,060
and then these proteins are
actually wrapped around more

188
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,680
and more, and eventually,
depending on what stage we are

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,660
in the cell's life, you have
different structures.

190
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,440
But when you talk about the
nucleic acid, which is the

191
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,420
DNA, and you combine that with
the proteins, you're talking

192
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,670
about the chromatin.

193
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,100
So this is DNA plus-- you can
view it as structural proteins

194
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,170
that give the DNA its shape.

195
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,640
And the idea, chromatin was
first used-- because when

196
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,460
people look at a cell, every
time I've drawn these cell

197
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,620
nucleuses so far, I've drawn
these very well defined-- I'll

198
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,150
use the word.

199
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,120
So let's say this is
a cell's nucleus.

200
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,060
I've been drawing very
well-defined structures here.

201
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,840
So that's one, and then this
could be another one, maybe

202
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,420
it's shorter, and then it has
its homologous chromosome.

203
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,410
So I've been drawing these
chromosomes, right?

204
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,790
And each of these chromosomes
I did in the last video are

205
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,270
essentially these long
structures of DNA, long chains

206
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,010
of DNA kind of wrapped tightly
around each other.

207
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,790
So when I drew it like that, if
we zoomed in, you'd see one

208
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,830
strand and it's really
just wrapped

209
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,680
around itself like this.

210
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,170
And then its homologous
chromosome-- and remember, in

211
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,500
the variation video, I talked
about the homologous

212
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,960
chromosome that essentially
codes for the same genes but

213
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,420
has a different version.

214
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,640
If the blue came from the dad,
the red came from the mom, but

215
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,130
it's coding for essentially
the same genes.

216
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,360
So when we talk about this one
chain, let's say this one

217
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,290
chain that I got from my dad of
DNA in this structure, we

218
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,660
refer to that as a chromosome.

219
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,400
Now, if we refer generally-- and
I want to be clear here.

220
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,950
DNA only takes this shape at
certain stages of its life

221
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,900
when it's actually replicating
itself-- not when it's

222
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,500
replicating.

223
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,940
Before the cell can divide,
DNA takes this very

224
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,430
well-defined shape.

225
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,240
Most of the cell's life, when
the DNA is actually doing its

226
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,700
work, when it's actually
creating proteins or proteins

227
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,080
are being essentially
transcribed and translated

228
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,380
from the DNA, the DNA isn't
all bundled up like this.

229
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,630
Because if it was bundled up
like, it would be very hard

230
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:42,310
for the replication and the
transcription machinery to get

231
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,710
onto the DNA and make the
proteins and do whatever else.

232
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,610
Normally, DNA-- let me draw
that same nucleus.

233
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,780
Normally, you can't even see
it with a normal light

234
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,240
microscope.

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,690
It's so thin that the DNA strand
is just completely

236
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,980
separated around the cell.

237
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,160
I'm drawing it here so you can
try to-- maybe the other one

238
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,560
is like this, right?

239
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,880
And then you have that shorter
strand that's like this.

240
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
And so you can't even see it.

241
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,500
It's not in this well-defined
structure.

242
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
This is the way it
normally is.

243
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,660
And they have the other short
strand that's like that.

244
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,550
So you would just see this
kind of big mess of a

245
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,760
combination of DNA and proteins,
and this is what

246
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,410
people essentially refer
to as chromatin.

247
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,540
So the words can be very
ambiguous and very confusing,

248
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,980
but the general usage is when
you're talking about the

249
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,580
well-defined one chain of DNA
in this kind of well-defined

250
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,260
structure, that is
a chromosome.

251
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,770
Chromatin can either refer to
kind of the structure of the

252
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,730
chromosome, the combination of
the DNA and the proteins that

253
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,450
give the structure, or it can
refer to this whole mess of

254
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,530
multiple chromosomes of which
you have all of this DNA from

255
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,100
multiple chromosomes
and all the

256
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,240
proteins all jumbled together.

257
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
So I just want to
make that clear.

258
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,990
Now, then the next word
is, well, what is

259
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,290
this chromatid thing?

260
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,310
What is this chromatid thing?

261
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,050
Actually, just in case I didn't,
I don't remember if I

262
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,550
labeled these.

263
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,210
These proteins that give
structure to the chromatin or

264
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,890
that make up the chromatin or
that give structure to the

265
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,540
chromosome, they're
called histones.

266
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,440
And there are multiple types
that give structure at

267
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,310
different levels, and we'll
do that in more detail.

268
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,850
So what's a chromatid?

269
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,780
When DNA replicates-- so
let's say that was

270
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,790
my DNA before, right?

271
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,400
When it's just in its normal
state, I have one version from

272
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,620
my dad, one version
from my mom.

273
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,270
Now, let's say it replicates.

274
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,680
So my version from my dad,
at first it's like this.

275
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,240
It's a big strand of DNA.

276
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,560
It creates another version of
itself that is identical, if

277
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,850
the machinery worked properly,
and so that identical piece

278
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,590
will look like this.

279
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,470
And they actually are initially

280
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,150
attached to each other.

281
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,000
They're attached to each other
at a point called the

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,250
centromere.

283
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,850
Now, even though I
have two strands

284
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,310
here, they're now attached.

285
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,860
When I have these two strands
that contain the exact-- so I

286
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,420
have this strand right here, and
then I have-- well, let me

287
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,180
actually draw it a
different way.

288
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,090
I could draw it multiple
different ways.

289
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,240
I could say this is one strand
here and then I have another

290
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,000
strand here.

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,180
Now, I have two copies.

292
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,120
They're coding for the
exact same DNA.

293
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,330
They're identical.

294
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,002
I still call this
a chromosome.

295
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,470
This whole thing is still called
a chromosome, but now

296
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,400
each individual copy is
called a chromatid.

297
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,660
So that's one chromatid and
this is another chromatid.

298
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,950
Sometimes they'll call them
sister chromatids.

299
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,740
Maybe they should call them twin
chromatids because they

300
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,580
have the same genetic
information.

301
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,490
So this chromosome has
two chromatids.

302
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,750
Now, before the replication
occurred or the DNA duplicated

303
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,540
itself, you could say that this
chromosome right here,

304
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,570
this chromosome like a father,
has one chromatid.

305
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,740
You could call it a chromatid,
although that tends to not be

306
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,610
the convention.

307
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,100
People start talking about
chromatids once you have two

308
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,780
of them in a chromosome.

309
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,760
And we'll learn in mitosis and
meiosis, these two chromatids

310
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,710
separate, and once they
separate, that same strand of

311
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,570
DNA that you once called a
chromatid, you now call them

312
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,380
individually chromosomes.

313
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,600
So that's one of them, and then
you have another one that

314
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,370
maybe gets separated
in this direction.

315
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,710
Let me circle that one
with the green.

316
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,190
So this one might move away like
that, and the one that I

317
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,510
circled in the orange might
move away like this.

318
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,820
Now, once they separate and
they're no longer connected by

319
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,290
the centromere, now what we
originally called as one

320
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,670
chromosome with two chromatids,
you will now refer

321
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,819
to as two separate
chromosomes.

322
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,950
Or you could say now you have
two separate chromosomes, each

323
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,790
made up of one chromatid.

324
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,530
So hopefully, that clears up a
little bit some of this jargon

325
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,240
around DNA.

326
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,130
I always found it
quite confusing.

327
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,359
But it'll be a useful tool
when we start going into

328
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,270
mitosis and meiosis, and
I start saying, oh, the

329
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,369
chromosomes become chromatids.

330
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,970
And you'll say, like, wait, how
did one chromosome become

331
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,859
two chromosomes?

332
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,280
And how did a chromatid
become a chromosome?

333
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,470
And it all just revolves
around the vocabulary.

334
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,730
I would have picked different
vocabulary than calling this a

335
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,730
chromosome and calling each
of these individually

336
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,880
chromosomes, but that's
the way we have

337
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,920
decided to name them.

338
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
Actually, just in case you're
curious, you're probably

339
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,750
thinking, where does this
word chromo come?

340
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,510
I don't know if you know
old Kodak film was

341
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,550
called chromo color.

342
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,460
And chromo essentially
relates to color.

343
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,910
I think it comes from the Greek
word actually for color.

344
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,830
It got that word because when
people first started looking

345
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,000
in the nucleus of a cell, they
would apply dye, and these

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
things that we call chromosomes
would take up the

347
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,020
dye so that we could see it well
with a light microscope.

348
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,540
And some comes from soma for
body, so you could kind of

349
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,560
view it as colored body,
so that's why

350
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,770
they call it a chromsome.

351
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,920
So chromatin also will take up--
well, I won't go into all

352
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,530
of that as well.

353
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,080
But hopefully, that clears
a little bit this whole

354
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,480
chromatid, chromosome, chromatin
debate, and we're

355
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,790
well equipped now to study
mitosis and meiosis.

00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,520
Welcome to the presentation on
using the quadratic equation.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,730
So the quadratic equation,
it sounds like something

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,810
very complicated.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,930
And when you actually first see
the quadratic equation, you'll

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,590
say, well, not only does it
sound like something

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,110
complicated, but it is
something complicated.

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,930
But hopefully you'll see,
over the course of this

8
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,580
presentation, that it's
actually not hard to use.

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,040
And in a future presentation
I'll actually show you

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,300
how it was derived.

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,810
So, in general, you've already
learned how to factor a

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,810
second degree equation.

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,910
You've learned that if I
had, say, x squared minus

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:40,340
x, minus 6, equals 0.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,970
If I had this equation. x
squared minus x minus x equals

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:48,720
zero, that you could factor
that as x minus 3 and

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,210
x plus 2 equals 0.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,955
Which either means that
x minus 3 equals 0 or

19
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,073
x plus 2 equals 0.

20
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:03,512
So x minus 3 equals 0
or x plus 2 equals 0.

21
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:08,500
So, x equals 3 or negative 2.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:17,980
And, a graphical representation
of this would be, if I had the

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:26,150
function f of x is equal to
x squared minus x minus 6.

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,760
So this axis is
the f of x axis.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,670
You might be more familiar with
the y axis, and for the purpose

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,780
of this type of problem,
it doesn't matter.

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,270
And this is the x axis.

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,430
And if I were to graph this
equation, x squared minus x,

29
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,380
minus 6, it would look
something like this.

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,130
A bit like -- this is f
of x equals minus 6.

31
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,900
And the graph will kind of
do something like this.

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,150
34
00:01:57,15 --> 00:02:00,03
Go up, it will keep going
up in that direction.

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,150
And know it goes through minus
6, because when x equals 0,

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,110
f of x is equal to minus 6.

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,800
So I know it goes
through this point.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,520
And I know that when f of x is
equal to 0, so f of x is equal

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,960
to 0 along the x axis, right?

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,600
Because this is 1.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,870
This is 0.

40
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,160
This is negative 1.

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,510
So this is where f of x
is equal to 0, along

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,420
this x axis, right?

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,210
And we know it equals 0 at the
points x is equal to 3 and

44
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,330
x is equal to minus 2.

45
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,360
That's actually what
we solved here.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,440
Maybe when we were doing the
factoring problems we didn't

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,940
realize graphically
what we were doing.

48
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,070
But if we said that f of x is
equal to this function, we're

49
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,270
setting that equal to 0.

50
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,820
So we're saying this
function, when does

51
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,220
this function equal 0?

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,390
When is it equal to 0?

53
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,720
Well, it's equal to 0 at
these points, right?

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,360
Because this is where
f of x is equal to 0.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,490
And then what we were doing
when we solved this by

56
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,970
factoring is, we figured out,
the x values that made f of x

57
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,160
equal to 0, which is
these two points.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,740
And, just a little terminology,
these are also called

59
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,860
the zeroes, or the
roots, of f of x.

60
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,470
63
00:03:12,47 --> 00:03:14,81
Let's review that a little bit.

61
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:23,700
So, if I had something like f
of x is equal to x squared plus

62
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,550
4x plus 4, and I asked you,
where are the zeroes, or

63
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,770
the roots, of f of x.

64
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,970
That's the same thing as
saying, where does f of x

65
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,300
interject intersect the x axis?

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,210
And it intersects the
x axis when f of x is

67
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,440
equal to 0, right?

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,120
If you think about the
graph I had just drawn.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,720
So, let's say if f of x is
equal to 0, then we could

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,860
just say, 0 is equal to x
squared plus 4x plus 4.

71
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,940
And we know, we could just
factor that, that's x

72
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,080
plus 2 times x plus 2.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:07,090
And we know that it's equal
to 0 at x equals minus 2.

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,170
78
00:04:10,17 --> 00:04:13,94
x equals minus 2.

75
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,270
Well, that's a little
-- x equals minus 2.

76
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,380
So now, we know how to find
the 0's when the the actual

77
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,560
equation is easy to factor.

78
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,500
But let's do a situation where
the equation is actually

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,850
not so easy to factor.

80
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,120
85
00:04:32,12 --> 00:04:39,75
Let's say we had f of x
is equal to minus 10x

81
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,380
squared minus 9x plus 1.

82
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,580
Well, when I look at this, even
if I were to divide it by 10 I

83
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,650
would get some fractions here.

84
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,130
And it's very hard to imagine
factoring this quadratic.

85
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,860
And that's what's actually
called a quadratic equation, or

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,580
this second degree polynomial.

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,600
But let's set it -- So we're
trying to solve this.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,420
Because we want to find
out when it equals 0.

89
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,130
Minus 10x squared
minus 9x plus 1.

90
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,090
We want to find out what
x values make this

91
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,260
equation equal to zero.

92
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,730
And here we can use a tool
called a quadratic equation.

93
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,625
And now I'm going to give you
one of the few things in math

94
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,030
that's probably a good
idea to memorize.

95
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,330
The quadratic equation says
that the roots of a quadratic

96
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,810
are equal to -- and let's say
that the quadratic equation is

97
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,900
a x squared plus b
x plus c equals 0.

98
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,790
So, in this example,
a is minus 10.

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,940
b is minus 9, and c is 1.

100
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:48,040
The formula is the roots x
equals negative b plus or minus

101
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:58,060
the square root of b squared
minus 4 times a times c,

102
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,230
all of that over 2a.

103
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,843
I know that looks complicated,
but the more you use it, you'll

104
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:04,400
see it's actually not that bad.

105
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,720
And this is a good
idea to memorize.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,730
So let's apply the quadratic
equation to this equation

107
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,670
that we just wrote down.

108
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,260
So, I just said -- and look,
the a is just the coefficient

109
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,610
on the x term, right?

110
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,300
a is the coefficient on
the x squared term.

111
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,570
b is the coefficient on the x
term, and c is the constant.

112
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,100
So let's apply it
tot this equation.

113
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,250
What's b?

114
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,700
Well, b is negative 9.

115
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,970
We could see here.

116
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,980
b is negative 9, a
is negative 10.

117
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,970
c is 1.

118
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,090
Right?

119
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,350
So if b is negative 9 -- so
let's say, that's negative 9.

120
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,260
Plus or minus the square
root of negative 9 squared.

121
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,810
Well, that's 81.

122
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,140
128
00:06:53,14 --> 00:06:56,94
Minus 4 times a.

123
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,760
a is minus 10.

124
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,240
Minus 10 times c, which is 1.

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,110
I know this is messy,
but hopefully you're

126
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,470
understanding it.

127
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,560
And all of that over 2 times a.

128
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,050
Well, a is minus 10, so
2 times a is minus 20.

129
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,990
So let's simplify that.

130
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,410
Negative times negative
9, that's positive 9.

131
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,460
Plus or minus the
square root of 81.

132
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,660
We have a negative 4
times a negative 10.

133
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,870
This is a minus 10.

134
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,280
I know it's very messy,
I really apologize

135
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,380
for that, times 1.

136
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,410
So negative 4 times negative
10 is 40, positive 40.

137
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,040
Positive 40.

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,070
And then we have all of
that over negative 20.

139
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,300
Well, 81 plus 40 is 121.

140
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,330
So this is 9 plus or
minus the square root

141
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,290
of 121 over minus 20.

142
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,620
Square root of 121 is 11.

143
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,170
So I'll go here.

144
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,184
Hopefully you won't lose
track of what I'm doing.

145
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:13,720
So this is 9 plus or
minus 11, over minus 20.

146
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,090
And so if we said 9 plus 11
over minus 20, that is 9

147
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,540
plus 11 is 20, so this
is 20 over minus 20.

148
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,730
Which equals negative 1.

149
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,900
So that's one root.

150
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,260
That's 9 plus -- because
this is plus or minus.

151
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,790
And the other root would be 9
minus 11 over negative 20.

152
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,720
Which equals minus
2 over minus 20.

153
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,700
Which equals 1 over 10.

154
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,690
So that's the other root.

155
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,950
So if we were to graph this
equation, we would see that it

156
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,640
actually intersects the x axis.

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,770
Or f of x equals 0 at the
point x equals negative

158
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,690
1 and x equals 1/10.

159
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm going to do a lot more
examples in part 2, because I

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,100
think, if anything, I might
have just confused

161
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,120
you with this one.

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,680
So, I'll see you in the
part 2 of using the

163
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,150
quadratic equation.

164
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,083

00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:20,357
Episode 14

3
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:34,867
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:40,633
I...am going to move out.

5
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:48,003
I'm going to get in your way.

6
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:51,367
It's a relief that Joon Gu works so hard.

7
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:54,204
My dad likes him a lot too.

8
00:00:54,204 --> 00:01:01,167
Now, I should help my father at his restaurant with Joon Gu.

9
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:05,008
You like him?Bong Joon Gu?

10
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:10,533
Of course I do.He liked only me for 4 years.

11
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,716
If someone says they like you, then you just like them like that too?

12
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:16,703
Why? I can't do that?

13
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:20,768
I'm tired of having a crush now.

14
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:24,335
I want to see a guy that likes me. I like Joon Gu.

15
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:31,133
You... like me.

16
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:36,133
You can't like anyone but me.

17
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,367
What is this, that confidence?

18
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,575
Am I not right?

19
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,811
Yes, you're right!

20
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,087
I only like you.

21
00:01:44,087 --> 00:02:09,405
So what am I supposed to do? You don't ever see me. Someone like me...

22
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:15,667
Don't say that you like another guy.

23
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,267
That's the second one.

24
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,195
Second what?

25
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:22,933
Kiss...

26
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,002
It's the third.

27
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:30,289
It's fine.

28
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:34,367
I'm not going to count any more.

29
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:44,007
Okay.

30
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:48,067
It's still not that time. They're kids.

31
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,533
There is no need for that.

32
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:56,333
Just because there are marriage talks, doesn't mean anything is going to happen right away.

33
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,133
It will be uncomfortable, no, I'm the one who is uncomfortable.

34
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,633
Gi Dong-shii !

35
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:05,867
Thanks for what you've done. Twice already...

36
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:14,297
I will definitely pay you back.

37
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:18,000
Hyung!

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,233
Oh dear! What happened to you two?

39
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,167
You'll catch a cold. Hurry, go upstairs and get changed.

40
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,767
Yes.

41
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:27,009
Hyung!

42
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:38,004
Oh Ha Ni is going to move out.

43
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:42,533
I have something to say.

44
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:43,867
To me?

45
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,009
Well, get changed first, then. . .

46
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,933
I . . . want to marry Oh Ha Ni.

47
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,833
What?

48
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,667
Seung Jo...

49
00:03:52,667 --> 00:04:00,267
Of course, not right away, but after we graduate, and Father's company is in a better state,

50
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:07,006
if you were to approve, Father.

51
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:10,267
A... are you being serious now?

52
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,001
Yes.

53
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:18,686
You already know, but our Ha Ni is not very good at anything.

54
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:19,009
I know.

55
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,599
And she is not very bright.

56
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:22,005
I know.

57
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,867
And she can't cook.

58
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:24,767
I know it well.

59
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:27,767
She's careless and accident prone.

60
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,933
The best.

61
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,718
Even so,

62
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:40,265
she's bright and is very good about doing the right thing.

63
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,376
She has a cute side to her.

64
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:49,042
Yes. I know it very well.

65
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:57,667
Well since Ha Ni likes you so much.

66
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,007
Ha Ni!

67
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,833
It really turned out well! This is great!

68
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:08,167
Hey Baek Seung Jo! Why are you so cool?

69
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,001
What to do?

70
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,667
Ha Ni!

71
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:38,133
I knew it would be like this.

72
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,006
You didn't go to sleep?

73
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,033
Yeah...

74
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,467
It stopped raining.

75
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,009
Oh...

76
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,467
Since it stopped raining, the sky seems clearer.

77
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,933
That's right.

78
00:05:54,933 --> 00:06:02,033
You're not cold?

79
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:08,367
I'm going to sleep first.

80
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,006
What?

81
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,009
What is it?

82
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:22,333
It's just that if you go to sleep like this, once it's morning,

83
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:28,467
"What if you go back to being the cold Baek Seung Jo?" That is what I was thinking.

84
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,667
Then, do you want us to sleep together tonight?

85
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,133
N... No. It's not like that.

86
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:43,008
Right. Let's just wait for a while.

87
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,767
I couldn't even imagine it,

88
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,233
that you would come to like me.

89
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:55,267
Me too.

90
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:57,467
I like you.

91
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:04,367
I like you very very much.

92
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,002
Mom, would you stop it?

93
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:22,067
Hey! Shh!

94
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,008
<i>Don't be like this... Joon Gu...

95
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:26,009
<i>Hey, don't.

96
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,667
<i>I told you to not do this Joon Gu!

97
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,767
Why did I do that?!

98
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:40,467
If I come onto her all of a sudden like that, then her feelings for me will just drop.

99
00:07:40,467 --> 00:08:20,767
Joon Gu, really, what is wrong with you?

100
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:47,267
You're not sleeping?

101
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,000
Ha Ni...

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,007
I did wrong yesterday.

103
00:08:51,007 --> 00:09:16,567
Eat this and forgive me, okay?

104
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:29,733
Someone is already here?

105
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:40,137
Aigoo!

106
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,337
Hey Joon Gu!

107
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:43,097
Why are you here already?

108
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,097
Oh Chef, did you go to the morning market?

109
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:47,637
Yeah, that's right.

110
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,303
But what is all of this? This early in the morning?

111
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,007
Why are you packing a lunch?

112
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,437
Hey, there are even chicken wings.

113
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:58,072
I was preparing it to give to Ha Ni.

114
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:59,203
Ha Ni?

115
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,703
Ah, yes.

116
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:06,637
Actually, I ... to Ha Ni ... It's nothing!

117
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:08,047
This is so fancy.

118
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:09,057
They've got titles to them too.

119
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:15,037
This is sweetened with honey so it's called "Oh Ha Ni."

120
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:16,137
Oh. Ha. Ni.

121
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:22,839
The focus of this one is the fried chicken wings so it's called, "Bong Joon Gu!"

122
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,937
Oh Ha Ni, Bong Joon Gu

123
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:30,937
How about we make a Sok Pal Book Lunch box?

124
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:35,017
Sok Pal Book Lunch box?

125
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:37,077
Ah, let me think about it.

126
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,903
Yes!

127
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:43,837
Oh Ha Ni~ Bong Joon Gu~ !

128
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:44,937
Done.

129
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,007
What? Is this a joke?

130
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,803
It's the truth!

131
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:53,403
He said it right in front of all of the adults!

132
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,337
Baek Seung Jo?

133
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:56,937
Not Bong Joon Gu?

134
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,703
Yeah.

135
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:02,007
Why? Why does he want to marry you suddenly?

136
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:05,067
I'm not sure. Maybe he finally realized my feelings.

137
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:10,203
He found out it was love. A story like that.

138
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,803
Then are you going to get married right away?

139
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,067
It's still far away Not before we graduate.

140
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:16,203
Wow, Oh Ha Ni, that's great!

141
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,903
Hey! I want to make you my life's mentor!

142
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,337
What's wrong with you!

143
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:24,903
Anyway, Congratulations The crush you had for 4 years is finally paying off!

144
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:27,027
So you finally did it!

145
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,047
Congrats!

146
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,903
Thanks.

147
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,087
You like it that much?!

148
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:36,037
Yeah, she's loving it!

149
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:41,017
Ah, then... what about Bong Joon Gu?

150
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:44,337
Ah, right. And Yoon Hae Ra...?

151
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,337
Seung Jo said he's gonna tell Hae Ra.

152
00:11:47,337 --> 00:12:07,537
And I have to tell Joon Gu.

153
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:15,203
Oh Ha Ni?

154
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:20,057
<i> Oh Ha Ni / Baek Seung Jo After 4 years of passionate love, finally the engagement.

155
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:46,103
I wonder who confessed first?It must be Oh Ha Ni.

156
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:51,037
It came faster than I thought

157
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:56,047
I knew that someday you would figure out your true feelings, but

158
00:12:56,047 --> 00:13:00,103
this day came sooner than I thought.

159
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:04,203
I didn't know either that this was going to happen.

160
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:06,903
Did you know?

161
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:10,057
Your mother knew too, didn't she?

162
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:15,237
Oh Ha Ni was really difficult.

163
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:19,803
It was like solving a problem with no answer.

164
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,027
That's why it was so hard.

165
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:24,303
But you didn't want to admit that, right?

166
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:30,837
That Baek Seung Jo had a problem that, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find an answer to.

167
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:35,137
How come you know me so well?

168
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:39,237
But now it isn't hard anymore?

169
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:42,077
It was hard when I was trying not to be shaken by those feelings

170
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:46,137
But when I admitted, "I've completely given up to this kid."

171
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:49,027
Once I surrendered to that, it's not hard any more.

172
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,337
Now it's fun.

173
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:55,503
Hey! You came to apologize, but aren't you just bragging too much?

174
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,603
Is that so?

175
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:03,503
Okay. I'm sincerely apologizing.

176
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:08,137
But I wasn't joking around.

177
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:11,537
I really thought we two would match well.

178
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,837
When I was with you, I was really comfortable.

179
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:20,903
You were running away from Oh Ha Ni and finding comfort in me right?

180
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,537
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:24,937
You're not saying you weren't.

182
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,017
But what to do?

183
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:34,087
"I'm fine." I can't say that.

184
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:37,007
Scared?

185
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:41,103
Okay. I've accepted it.

186
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,027
Congratutlations on your marriage.

187
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,087
It's still far away!

188
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:51,403
I'm congratulating you early then.

189
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:53,137
Okay.

190
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:57,007
What is this? I'm trying to throw away my feelings.

191
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,403
Why is your hand so warm?

192
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,703
You're really a nice girl.

193
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:26,403
I know.

194
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:29,503
Joon Gu, let's eat.

195
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:31,537
I don't feel like it. Go ahead.

196
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:35,037
Does a person working in the cafeteria bother to think about eating?

197
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:39,403
While we're not busy we have to eat and clean up. Hurry and come.

198
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,037
Oh, what's that?

199
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,137
It looks like a lunch box.

200
00:15:44,137 --> 00:16:11,237
Is he saying he doesn't feel like it since he brought his lunch?

201
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,037
- Hey, is this octopus or rice cake? - It's rice cake!

202
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:17,537
Look at the way he wrapped this meat?!

203
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,097
I bet it's delicious!

204
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:23,503
It's really delicious!

205
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:28,803
I'm being truly honest when I say this... apart from how Bong looks...

206
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:31,637
I can't believe it's to this point!

207
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,803
I would pay over 10 times to eat this.

208
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:40,503
I feel the same way. It's so good.

209
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:45,537
Joon Gu you could sell this right away!

210
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:52,403
Quit that noodle place and let's open up a lunch box shop?! What do you think?!

211
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:55,803
Ha Ni, have you eaten?

212
00:16:55,803 --> 00:17:53,337
I don't know.

213
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:57,087
I should have told him in person first.

214
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:01,067
I left after what happened last night too.

215
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,087
Did Seung Jo tell her yet?

216
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:10,237
It seemed like Hae Ra really liked Seung Jo a lot, too.

217
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:16,007
That's probably why she was like that to me.

218
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,007
Why is dating so difficult?

219
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,203
"Oh Ha Ni, Baek Seung Jo"?!

220
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:24,047
"After 4 years of passionate love, finally the engagement"?!

221
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,103
What does this Oh Ha Ni look like?!

222
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,137
What does she look like that she was able to accomplish this feat?!

223
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:34,437
That's freaking amazing!

224
00:18:34,437 --> 00:19:00,027
But she's so ugly, she's really ugly!

225
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,037
I like you.

226
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,903
<i>Let's just take a chance,

227
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,937
<i>on each other.

228
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:22,503
<i>Let's... start.

229
00:19:22,503 --> 00:20:21,003
<i> You're a really fine woman.

230
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:24,457
Where are the beverages?

231
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:29,482
Ah, yeah.

232
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:31,431
She must be really thirsty.

233
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,906
I have to know what she likes so that I can buy it. Water?

234
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:38,388
No, not water. It's not cold!

235
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,672
Oh this is cold, this is cold!

236
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,035
I don't even know if she likes that.

237
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,392
A drink like this?!

238
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:51,787
Just because she was exercising doesn't mean I can give her a sports drink! Coke, Coke, Coke!

239
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,761
Ah, right, Diet Coke.

240
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:55,565
That would imply that she has to lose weight.

241
00:20:55,565 --> 00:21:00,354
There's nothing for her to lose! What should I buy?

242
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,206
Excuse me!

243
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:49,923
When you're really thirsty, what do you like to drink?

244
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:53,032
Yoon Hae Ra, why are you like this, really?

245
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:59,722
Are you okay?

246
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:01,587
Beer?

247
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:13,554
It was cool, earlier on...

248
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:15,124
Fine.

249
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:35,604
I'm thirsty.

250
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,296
Why won't this open!

251
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:42,663
Should I open it up for you?

252
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:51,372
It's fine.

253
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:59,335
Ah. It's really annoying.

254
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:02,237
It's okay if you sob,

255
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:03,979
I'm okay with it.

256
00:23:03,979 --> 00:24:21,333
Don't hold it back.

257
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,251
Ha Ni, I really

258
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:36,391
wanted to do this together with you.

259
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,273
You are my life's

260
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:45,387
navigation system

261
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:48,492
You guide me through

262
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:50,442
the paths I have to..

263
00:24:50,442 --> 00:25:19,084
to take.

264
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,412
Yes, Chef!

265
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:24,536
I'm out for some fresh air now .

266
00:25:24,536 --> 00:26:04,421
Yes, I understand. I'll be coming back now.

267
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:07,479
Make sure to clean up nicely before you go in.

268
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:11,758
I understand -Good job today - Good job today.

269
00:26:11,758 --> 00:27:09,331
Great job.

270
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,076
You came!

271
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,362
Good thing you came.

272
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:16,356
Chef left his wallet. Where was it...Oh here it is.

273
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:20,195
Here.

274
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:33,098
Wallet?

275
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:38,155
The colour is pretty. What is it?

276
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:42,003
Chlorella.

277
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:46,156
Joon Gu, I ...

278
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:47,089
I have something to say.

279
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:48,393
I'm sorry, but

280
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:49,979
today you have to go home.

281
00:27:49,979 --> 00:28:09,681
I'm really busy.

282
00:28:09,681 --> 00:28:14,019
Bong Joon Gu. Let's have a talk.

283
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,528
You must be kidding.

284
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,005
What do I have to talk with you about?

285
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:18,927
Just go.

286
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:20,042
Then I'll say it right here.

287
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,976
I...

288
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:27,833
like Oh Ha Ni.

289
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:31,868
We don't need your permission to date, but

290
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:34,645
it's important for Ha Ni.

291
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:37,826
It would be good if you let it go.

292
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:39,818
If you let her go, everything will be fine.

293
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,411
Hey!

294
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:43,036
That's something stupid to say.

295
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,469
Let go... let go of what?

296
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:45,869
Hey Baek Seung Jo.

297
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:48,493
All this time you've been so mean to Ha Ni.

298
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,979
Now what are you trying to say?

299
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,079
It seems like you don't know,

300
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,023
but for 4 years, I liked Ha Ni.

301
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:57,944
Joon Gu.

302
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:02,209
I'm sorry.

303
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,032
Why are you sorry?

304
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:07,987
Of course I'm sorry

305
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:12,542
and thankful.

306
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,935
But I really...

307
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:16,659
It's fine.

308
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,611
Don't say it.

309
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:21,208
I already know.

310
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:26,125
I already saw it.

311
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,797
Ah Oh Ha Ni, really...

312
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:30,035
You really have no taste in guys.

313
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:33,284
Later,even if you regret it,

314
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,883
I'm not going to give in.

315
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:39,052
Will you be okay with that?

316
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:43,362
See? You can't even respond quickly enough.

317
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:44,878
Baek Seung Jo.

318
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:46,042
What are you going to do?

319
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,983
Ha Ni isn't able to respond.

320
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,608
Yeah.

321
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:54,577
I'm getting nervous.

322
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,435
Seung Jo.

323
00:29:56,435 --> 00:30:02,054
Just know that I'm always going to be watching you.

324
00:30:02,054 --> 00:30:04,747
If you make tears come out of Ha Ni's eyes,

325
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:09,487
I'll make bloody tears come out of your eyes.

326
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:45,058
I'll keep that in mind.

327
00:30:45,058 --> 00:31:21,098
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viki.com

328
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:23,813
What is this?

329
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:39,741
Get in.

330
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:40,813
What car is this?

331
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:45,013
It's a company car. I'm using it for now.

332
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:51,147
It just didn't feel right in my father's car.

333
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:52,847
Wow...

334
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:56,068
it's nice!

335
00:31:56,068 --> 00:32:00,113
Then should we go driving?

336
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:25,747
Don't think like that. This car is for company use only.

337
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:36,078
Here.

338
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:46,048
Something to eat while you drink.

339
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:49,048
Chef...

340
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,068
Yes, Joon Gu?

341
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:54,347
You know, I ...

342
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:59,979
wanted to call you Father.

343
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:06,213
I truly wanted to call you "Father-in-law."

344
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:32,447
My father-in-law.

345
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:36,013
I'm really sorry about what happened with your grand daughter.

346
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,813
It's all my fault.

347
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:46,247
Collapsing and all. Seung Jo may be reliable, but he's still very young.

348
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,313
He's not ...

349
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:50,457
You don't need to beat around the bush.

350
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:56,213
My investment was on the line, and since that all happened, my investment is no longer there.

351
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:57,013
It's simple.

352
00:33:57,013 --> 00:34:02,744
But still... the game is almost complete and you really enjoyed it...

353
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:06,413
I'm not that great of a person.

354
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:10,247
I can't separate how I feel and what I'm supposed to do!

355
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:21,847
Since there was interest, the game is probably liked.

356
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,647
Seung Jo!

357
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,047
Did you come to witness the punishment for yourself?

358
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:33,147
No. I settled the matter with your granddaughter myself.

359
00:34:33,147 --> 00:34:35,713
Today, I came to talk about business.

360
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:36,068
Seung Jo.

361
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,347
What?!

362
00:34:37,347 --> 00:34:43,847
Saying sorry for what happened, I don't think Hae Ra would want that.

363
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:48,147
For whatever reason, putting herself in a hurtful position...

364
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:51,313
a position to accept an apology, I don't think she'd like it.

365
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:53,018
I have a similar personality so I know her quite well.

366
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:58,947
So? You're not going to apologize for Hae Ra but you still want me to invest?

367
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:00,113
Yes.

368
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:01,113
Seung Jo!

369
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:04,887
Please invest,

370
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:08,954
but you don't necessarily need to invest in our company.

371
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:12,787
Our game, we can pass it on to a different company,

372
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:17,913
or your company can service it completely.

373
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:23,947
Wherever it may be, please allow us to have game service.

374
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:30,747
For the last 2 months our employees have worked day and night, even forgoing their paychecks.

375
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,854
They worked very hard,

376
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:37,387
and the results came out nicely.

377
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:42,048
It's fine if you throw out our company, but please at least allow this game to see the spotlight,

378
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:48,347
and please save our developers.

379
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:52,047
To give up on those below me because you dislike me...

380
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:55,018
It's childish?

381
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:57,038
You're teaching me right now, aren't you?

382
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,038
It's not that.

383
00:35:58,038 --> 00:36:01,447
Baek Seung Jo! I don't like you.

384
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:02,147
I'm very sorry.

385
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:03,687
You should at least plead for something.

386
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:07,008
Invest in us or it's the end for us.

387
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,921
I did wrong with Hae Ra. Please forgive me.

388
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:12,113
You need to plead like that, rascal.

389
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:18,347
That way I'll waver and sign the contract.

390
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:21,008
Idiot.

391
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,028
<i>Yes, President?

392
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:25,038
Bring the stamp (used to sign contracts).

393
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:26,213
Thank you very much.

394
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:28,923
You can't mooch off my money.

395
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:30,445
Pay me back multiples.

396
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:33,762
Yes, I'll do that.

397
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:34,862
Thank you.

398
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,929
Thank you.

399
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:39,043
So the launch is next week?

400
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:39,872
Yes.

401
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:42,462
As long as there are no problems.

402
00:36:42,462 --> 00:36:45,162
Seung Jo you're amazing.

403
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:49,973
I'm really indebted to you this time.

404
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:51,662
I was very surprised.

405
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:53,809
Made me wonder whether you are really my son.

406
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:57,529
You're cool.

407
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:01,365
But you can't brag in front of me.

408
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:03,629
Do you think I've been through this only once or twice?

409
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,696
Yes, it must have been like that.

410
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:11,062
Yes that's why you should quit now.

411
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,696
You did enough so you can stop.

412
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:18,162
It's time for you to pick a major for next year.

413
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:22,996
You have to go to med school.

414
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:27,048
But there's no guarantee that this game will be successful.

415
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:30,762
Then we'll just be in debt. And your health...

416
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,041
I just told you not to brag!

417
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:40,662
I'm fairly famous in the gaming industry within our country! Don't you try to overstep me!

418
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:43,096
Seung Jo, don't you dare steal my place.

419
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:46,962
I'm going to do this for the next 20 years.

420
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:49,229
20 years?

421
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:50,796
And after that?

422
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:53,396
I'm here!

423
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,662
I'm better at gaming than my brother.

424
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:03,062
He doesn't like games, and he doesn't like them.

425
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:09,129
If I work hard from now on, I can become a great heir.

426
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:15,096
So, Seung jo, become a doctor. Become a doctor and help NoRi.

427
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:18,796
No Ri is sick again.

428
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:24,396
I saved this nearly collapsing company, but seems I've been instantly kicked out.

429
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:41,129
Yes, as soon as this new game launches, let's shoot him off to med school!

430
00:38:41,129 --> 00:38:43,429
Poor you...

431
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:46,242
There isn't a day where your hands are normal.

432
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:50,329
Lately I always hurt myself because of the cutting exercises.

433
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:53,262
And this one I was curling...

434
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:55,529
Did you say the qualification test was next month?

435
00:38:55,529 --> 00:39:00,129
When I finish school, you two have to buy me a set of scissors (hair cutting)

436
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,096
But that's expensive.

437
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:07,362
Buy it anyway! That's what people get when they graduate! You two start saving your money.

438
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:09,829
Got it! I'll have to take on a part-time job.

439
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,996
Then buy me a tablet.

440
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:13,696
What's a tablet?

441
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:15,962
There's this thing you use to draw when using a computer.

442
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,996
Ah, Min Ah I saw your webtoon!

443
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:21,896
"Pitpatting Parang High." It was totally about us! It was so amusing.

444
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:27,062
Hey, what are you? You drew me like that, am I that fat?!

445
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:29,329
Why? The feedback was really good.

446
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,929
Hey, in her webtoon your character is the most popular.

447
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,929
Really?

448
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:38,096
Dok Go Min Ah, are you going to become a famous cartoonist then?

449
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:41,796
Looks like I'll have to get a signature. Hurry up and give me a signature.

450
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,162
Hurry!

451
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:50,429
The game we are launching this month is a new MMORPG with realistic visual action aspects to it.

452
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:56,729
We will be implementing real time play within the existing market, which will make a big impact and change the way games are played.

453
00:39:56,729 --> 00:40:02,462
It's a taste of a game that none other possesses with focus on animation like graphics.

454
00:40:02,462 --> 00:40:03,896
Then,

455
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:06,396
we'll start now.

456
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:13,862
These days online games are exported just as much as cars, maybe more, and therefore quality has gone down causing concern.

457
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:18,162
But a new game was released that could be the new face of this declining industry.

458
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:24,362
Within this gaming industry that's filled with games that require boring time commitments and nothing more than extravagant graphics..

459
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:30,729
We have created a fun animation game that is easy to enjoy.

460
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,396
As expected!

461
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,762
Isn't he fine, Grandfather?

462
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:38,396
Yeah. He is desirable.

463
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:44,417
Of course! Would I have liked a trivial person?

464
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:47,829
It's in past tense.

465
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,729
Then, have you cleared up your feelings?

466
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:53,162
You were really upset over it.

467
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:57,662
Seeing him again, I'm getting greedy again.

468
00:40:57,662 --> 00:41:00,096
Ah, how tiring.

469
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:06,096
Joon Gu, it's a favor.

470
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,429
Joon Gu, hurry with the dishes...

471
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:11,629
Cut up some scallions, and cook some more noodles.

472
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:16,196
Yes, I understand.

473
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:21,429
Right Baek Seung Jo. Let's try our best.

474
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:25,196
You can enjoy all aspects of action with our game.

475
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:29,296
Hey, you being around motivates me even more.

476
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:37,473
Just wait and see. I'll become a great person too.

477
00:41:37,473 --> 00:41:42,007
On the Internet, the feedback from the game is explosive.

478
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:47,004
Even if he is my son, Seung Jo is really amazing.

479
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,094
Ha Ni, I saw the webtoon Min Ah put on the Internet. It was so funny.

480
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:55,054
Isn't it? Lately that webtoon has been really popular.

481
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,084
I think in good time she should be amongst some of the most popular cartoonists.

482
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,973
That's great.

483
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:02,573
I know. I'm so happy for her.

484
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:06,054
I see because she's so talented she's already making a name for herself.

485
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:11,074
I hear getting a job for university grads is real hard these days so they're interviewing like crazy. Good for her.

486
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:16,273
Despite these hard times I hear there are tons of students that don't give a care in the world.

487
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:17,973
That friend of yours must be working really hard.

488
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:20,373
Yes, they're working hard

489
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:25,073
That doesn't "care for a thing" student, we have one at our house too.

490
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:27,612
You...again!

491
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,084
Oh, Ha Ni, something came from the school for you

492
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:36,507
Eun Jo, give me that thing on the very top over there.

493
00:42:36,507 --> 00:42:37,171
Here.

494
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:40,024
Yes.

495
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:46,607
What is it?

496
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:52,307
What is it?

497
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:53,973
Report card...

498
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:55,673
Huh?

499
00:42:55,673 --> 00:43:13,862
It's probably obvious.

500
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:23,873
What do I do!?

501
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:32,407
I calculated my credits and was reassured. I thought it was okay.

502
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:33,074
I don't have enough credits.

503
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:35,094
Then the credits on there were probably calculated incorrectly.

504
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:37,421
Huh?

505
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:40,473
It seems like it.

506
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:41,607
What do I do?

507
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:46,039
If you don't have enough credits, then you have to push through again.

508
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:48,807
There's no use in coming to me and crying.

509
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:53,064
You caused these results by yourself, so you're the only one that can take care of this.

510
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:55,034
Yes.

511
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:56,064
I know that much.

512
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:58,773
Then, it is fine.

513
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:02,373
Excuse me...

514
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:07,207
I think I'm just no good at studying

515
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:11,073
Should I just give up school?

516
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:15,054
I tried on my own.

517
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:17,034
It seems like my grades aren't going up.

518
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:23,407
Because if you do that then you could spend a bit more time following me around?

519
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:24,084
It's not exactly like that.

520
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:30,473
What about when everyone around you was studying like crazy to get good grades so they could get a job?

521
00:44:30,473 --> 00:44:31,094
What were you doing?

522
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:35,064
Have you thought about your future career?

523
00:44:35,064 --> 00:44:40,014
You don't think things through enough and that's why your calculations are wrong,

524
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:43,707
and your credits don't add up.

525
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:45,107
Baek Seung Jo!

526
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:48,582
Am I wrong?

527
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:50,054
You don't know my feelings.

528
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:53,115
You're good at everything without even trying whether it's grades or sports.

529
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:56,054
You're popular with girls

530
00:44:56,054 --> 00:45:00,044
Baek Seung Jo, you don't understand others' struggles.

531
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:02,173
Someone like you can't understand my feelings.

532
00:45:02,173 --> 00:45:06,407
If you didn't have perseverance what would be left of you?

533
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:08,407
Then you...

534
00:45:08,407 --> 00:45:15,094
don't have any charm.

535
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:18,054
You were this cold of a person,

536
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:23,215
Baek Seung Jo.

537
00:45:23,215 --> 00:45:24,588
Where are you going?

538
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,803
Wherever

539
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:33,648
Is there even a place for you to go this late at night?

540
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,148
I have.

541
00:45:35,148 --> 00:45:37,012
I might just go to a different guy!

542
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:39,415
So you have that kind of courage?

543
00:45:39,415 --> 00:45:41,548
Bong Joong Gu or...

544
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:42,932
Kyung Su sunbae?

545
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:46,648
Even if you regret it later, I won't care.

546
00:45:46,648 --> 00:46:03,881
Do as you wish.

547
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:06,648
<i>You are too much Baek Seung Jo!</i>

548
00:46:06,648 --> 00:46:10,115
<i>I'm already upset because of my credits,

549
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,781
<i>and you stepped all over that.

550
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:15,815
<i>As happy as I am, I still get hurt too.

551
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:20,115
<i>All I wanted was for you to comfort me a bit.

552
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,275
<i>Cold blooded Baek Seung Jo!

553
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:25,775
What did you say to Ha Ni?

554
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:31,009
She's the kind of girl who didn't give up, even when you were so mean to her.

555
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,934
Tell me. What did you say to her?

556
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:36,045
What could you have said to make her leave?

557
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:38,542
She probably went to her friends.

558
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:41,064
Besides, I didn't say much.

559
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,742
I just gave her some motivation because it seemed like she was given an academic warning.

560
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:48,942
You really. I thought you were doing well.

561
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:49,845
Why are you like that again?

562
00:46:49,845 --> 00:46:51,717
This is a good chance.

563
00:46:51,717 --> 00:47:12,307
She needs to be apart from me a little, so that she can think for herself.

564
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:14,642
Joo Ri!

565
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:17,909
Oh!Ha Ni!

566
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:20,022
Why are you here at this time?

567
00:47:20,022 --> 00:47:22,462
I . . .

568
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:24,342
left the house.

569
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,309
What?

570
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,809
Yah!

571
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:32,052
You failed one of your classes, didn't you?

572
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:34,942
So you fought with Baek Seung Jo?

573
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:36,009
Lovers' quarrel?

574
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:38,609
Hey! I'm not in the mood for joking!

575
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:44,583
Even if you're really mad, who would just leave the house like that?

576
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:47,209
He'll probably come get her.

577
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:48,018
Really?

578
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:51,742
I don't know It's been a long time we had such good beer, let's drink up!

579
00:47:51,742 --> 00:48:01,209
Right! Drink up!!

580
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:04,842
Don't worry and just drink. You can spend the night at my place.

581
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:17,342
Thank you.

582
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:23,375
<i> Did Seung Jo already go to sleep?

583
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,675
<i>No, that is not possible.

584
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:31,659
<i> Because I left like that, he must be worried and not able to sleep.

585
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:36,709
<i> Would he come looking for me?

586
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:41,709
<i> Should I send him a message to let him know at least where I am?

587
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:46,175
<i> No matter how, it seems like I overreacted

588
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:50,575
<i> saying I'll go to another man.

589
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:54,093
<i> He'll come to get me tomorrow, right?

590
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:59,826
<i>He's probably reflecting, right?

591
00:48:59,826 --> 00:49:02,226
<i> Baek Seung Jo,

592
00:49:02,226 --> 00:49:05,659
<i> I'm lonely without you.

593
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:08,113
<i>It's upsetting but . . .

594
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:19,637
<i> I miss you, Seung Jo!

595
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:24,193
Really? Yeah.

596
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:27,681
Oh Ha Ni, it looks like you didn't sleep well.

597
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:31,793
If you miss Seung Jo, just go back home.

598
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,508
I can't give in first now that I've come this far.

599
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:40,926
It's a good chance to make Seung Jo realize how large my presence was.

600
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:43,475
I can't keep on being the only one saying I like him.

601
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:47,433
Aigoo, Oh Ha Ni! Only now did you return to your senses?

602
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:50,494
I have to go now. I'll be late.

603
00:49:50,494 --> 00:49:51,432
Bye!

604
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:52,226
Fighting! Work hard.

605
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:54,626
Call me.

606
00:49:54,626 --> 00:50:01,813
Bye!

607
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:03,521
Right, you thought well.

608
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:08,059
You should be able to do that too.

609
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:13,759
But how is Seung Jo doing?

610
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:18,575
Should I take a small look from afar?

611
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:20,059
Oh Ha Ni!

612
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,493
Why? It's fun!

613
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:26,693
To see Baek Seung Jo's struggling face because he misses me.

614
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:32,859
Let's go, okay?

615
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:46,293
He's over there.

616
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,959
He looks like he's having fun.

617
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:54,193
He's not struggling at all.

618
00:50:54,193 --> 00:50:57,526
I'm definitely not going back home!

619
00:50:57,526 --> 00:51:02,293
Never ever!

620
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,159
Are you sighing again?

621
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:09,593
Ha Ni left yesterday and hasn't called.

622
00:51:09,593 --> 00:51:10,859
I am back!

623
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,593
Oh, you're here early!

624
00:51:12,593 --> 00:51:14,593
What about Ha Ni? Did you find her?

625
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,959
No.

626
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:21,059
How about putting an end to this and bringing her back home?

627
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:24,626
Ha Ni is also just being stubborn right now.

628
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:29,226
She wants to come back but hasn't had the chance, so she's having a hard time.

629
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:35,226
You don't even know that?

630
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:38,826
How can someone be that cold?

631
00:51:38,826 --> 00:51:42,426
Oh poor Ha Ni!

632
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:45,059
Ah let's just leave them.

633
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:48,159
After all, it's something that concerns only them.

634
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,426
Won't something good come out of Ha Ni being apart for a little while?

635
00:51:52,426 --> 00:51:58,526
If Gi Dong shi says that too, then what are we going to do?

636
00:51:58,526 --> 00:52:00,393
Ha Ni!

637
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:07,059
She's only been gone one day and I miss her this much.

638
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:11,593
I'm sorry. My family came all of a sudden. You're going home, right?

639
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:14,126
Huh?

640
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:16,293
Don't be like that and just go back home.

641
00:52:16,293 --> 00:52:22,559
He might have been a little harsh, but I think he said all that for your own good.

642
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,493
Go home.

643
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:25,559
Okay.

644
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,526
You go back in first.

645
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:30,126
I am sorry Ha Ni. Cheer up!

646
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:31,459
Yes.

647
00:52:31,459 --> 00:52:38,926
I'm going.

648
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:41,893
Go back in first. They're waiting for you.

649
00:52:41,893 --> 00:52:46,893
Huh?

650
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:48,759
I'm going. Go back home.

651
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:58,259
Ok.

652
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,226
I love you!

653
00:52:59,226 --> 00:52:59,893
Me too!

654
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:18,326
Go!

655
00:53:18,326 --> 00:53:21,096
Where I am going to go now?

656
00:53:21,096 --> 00:53:24,993
Bad Beak Seung Jo!

657
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,393
He's not even worried!

658
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:35,129
How could he not even call?

659
00:53:35,129 --> 00:54:20,273
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

660
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:23,573
Come to our club! We will escort you.

661
00:54:23,573 --> 00:54:24,007
I ...

662
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:50,024
It's really great.

663
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:51,307
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

664
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:54,084
Since you're not looking for her, the least I can do is to go out and look for her myself.

665
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:57,004
I'm worried too,

666
00:54:57,004 --> 00:55:02,807
but since it's happened, you should leave her to solve this herself.

667
00:55:02,807 --> 00:55:07,073
For Ha Ni's sake, it's a good thing

668
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:09,014
I understand.

669
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,074
But you... do you know...?

670
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:19,084
A person's feelings don't have one answer like a math problem.

671
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:48,207
What the right answer is...I don't know either.

672
00:55:48,207 --> 00:56:00,673
<i>Seung Jo’s words are right… I always depend on others. I’ve never thought about myself or done anything for my future.

673
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:03,507
<i> I still can't go back.

674
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:07,707
<i> This didn’t change me at all.

675
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:22,273
<i> Just wait, before we get married, I'll become a woman worthy of you Baek Seung Jo.

676
00:56:22,273 --> 00:56:27,373
Thanks for coming! Please come again!

677
00:56:27,373 --> 00:56:41,207
Workers needed!

678
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:42,014
Did you finish?

679
00:56:42,014 --> 00:56:43,074
Yes.

680
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:48,014
But will a young lady like you be able to do it?

681
00:56:48,014 --> 00:56:50,084
Though it looks like this, it's going to be pretty hard.

682
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:52,054
If it's hard, the harder it is the better.

683
00:56:52,054 --> 00:56:55,044
If there are a lot of orders you might even have to cook

684
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,073
Now, don't worry about that.

685
00:56:57,073 --> 00:56:59,014
My dad is a chef,

686
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:01,607
and his noodle restaurant has a 60 year old history.

687
00:57:01,607 --> 00:57:03,807
Is that so?

688
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:07,073
So, can you start today?

689
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:10,054
Actually, one of the ladies quit so we do need help.

690
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:11,094
Yes. Of course.

691
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,307
I'll do my best.

692
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:16,873
It's okay. Let me do this.

693
00:57:16,873 --> 00:57:23,673
Okay. You do it.

694
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,373
Aunty, I'll do the dishes too

695
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:26,973
Just leave them.

696
00:57:26,973 --> 00:57:32,307
Working part-time in a restaurant?

697
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:37,084
I thought she went back home, but she is working in that restaurant.

698
00:57:37,084 --> 00:57:40,407
Oh Ha Ni is out looking for trouble again.

699
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:43,373
She said that this should be kept a secret from Seung Jo.

700
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:47,473
So she doesn't want to see Baek Seung Jo until she makes something great out of herself?

701
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:50,107
No, apparently the restaurant is a bit grungy

702
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:53,094
The dirty aprons don't make her feel right

703
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,064
What is this? Ah.

704
00:57:55,064 --> 00:57:57,024
But how is she going to go to school?

705
00:57:57,024 --> 00:58:04,273
She did say something about dropping out. Is she going to continue working there?

706
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:09,073
Oh my.

707
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:17,014
Baek Seung Jo

708
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:23,573
I'll be going now!

709
00:58:23,573 --> 00:58:34,973
I'm back!

710
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,064
Welcome!

711
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:39,707
What should we have?

712
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:42,207
Our bean-paste soup is really good.

713
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:45,573
Then should we have that? Two bean-paste soups please.

714
00:58:45,573 --> 00:58:47,207
Ah, yes.

715
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:51,307
Aunty, two bean-paste soups please.

716
00:58:51,307 --> 01:00:04,407
Please enjoy your meals!

717
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:07,607
Oh Ha Ni?

718
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:09,084
Aren't you Oh Ha Ni?

719
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:12,807
No, I'm not.

720
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:14,773
You are. You are Ha Ni.

721
01:00:14,773 --> 01:00:17,007
What are you doing here, Ha Ni?

722
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:20,607
Are you working?

723
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,064
Something like that.

724
01:00:23,064 --> 01:00:28,044
I heard you got into the law program. You must be studying for the licensing exam, right?

725
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:30,773
I heard it was really hard.

726
01:00:30,773 --> 01:00:35,673
If you're not someone like the genius Baek Seung Jo, then it'll be difficult to pass with one try.

727
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:39,473
There are even people who've been taking the test for 12 years.

728
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:43,573
You guys are lucky that everything comes so easy to you guys.

729
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,773
A lot of people say it like that.

730
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:51,907
But doesn't matter how smart you are, it's hard following the masses.

731
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:56,064
I'm not sure, but Seung Jo is probably trying really hard on his own too.

732
01:00:56,064 --> 01:01:04,084
Nothing comes free in life, kiddo.

733
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:09,107
Since you have such a hard time studying,

734
01:01:09,107 --> 01:01:10,094
you're trying to find something else to do?!

735
01:01:10,094 --> 01:01:13,173
What would it be?

736
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,707
By any chance...

737
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:17,024
housewife?

738
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:21,007
That's perfect Ha Ni. You and the tray look perfect together.

739
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:22,707
Work hard. I'm rooting for you.

740
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:28,024
Unnie is going to go. I've got to study.

741
01:01:28,024 --> 01:01:39,173
Please continue.

742
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:41,307
Aunty, I'm back.

743
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:44,573
Oh good job. Customer at table 9 ordered bean paste soup.

744
01:01:44,573 --> 01:02:00,407
I'll go out for a sec.

745
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:11,024
Please enjoy your meal!

746
01:02:11,024 --> 01:02:15,072
It's tasteless.

747
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:17,084
Is that so? I'll make it again.

748
01:02:17,084 --> 01:02:21,472
Even if you make it again, it will probably taste the same.

749
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:22,107
Seung Jo.

750
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:32,034
Your friends said that the food here is delicious? What's wrong with the taste?

751
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:35,807
Okay. What are you going to do in the future?

752
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:41,807
Being apart from you for a couple days...

753
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:48,054
I realized how tiring I am towards you and how childish I was.

754
01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:52,064
I think I thought too much of my comfort.

755
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,373
So,

756
01:02:54,373 --> 01:02:59,507
you've made a decision after thinking it over?

757
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:02,907
What is the thing I want to do the most?

758
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:05,273
I thought about it.

759
01:03:05,273 --> 01:03:07,773
What is that?

760
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:13,473
Seung Jo, you may think it's ridiculous and laugh in my face.

761
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:18,407
No matter how much I think about it, this is the only thing I want.

762
01:03:18,407 --> 01:03:21,873
Helping with Baek Seung Jo's work.

763
01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:26,407
I'm going to become a nurse.

764
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:29,074
Since it has to do with life (the living),

765
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:33,094
you might think it's too much for me.

766
01:03:33,094 --> 01:03:39,064
Even so, I'm seriously thinking about it.

767
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:50,707
I want to become a wife who would suit you.

768
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:53,573
So you've thought a lot about it.

769
01:03:53,573 --> 01:03:58,773
Trying your best to become a nurse.

770
01:03:58,773 --> 01:04:08,373
Seung Jo.

771
01:04:08,373 --> 01:04:13,573
Stop it and come back home now.

772
01:04:13,573 --> 01:04:16,807
Is it fine if I do?

773
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:25,207
The truth is, I missed you so much I thought I would die.

774
01:04:25,207 --> 01:04:37,507
I know, I know it all.

775
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:42,773
You must really be busy with school Seung Jo. Its going to be hard seeing you around.

776
01:04:42,773 --> 01:04:47,107
It seems that I will be out of it until graduation.

777
01:04:47,107 --> 01:04:47,094
I . . .

778
01:04:47,094 --> 01:04:52,973
That's right! The game Seung Jo developed, it's going to an American game show next year!

779
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:55,773
Wow!

780
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:57,014
That's great.

781
01:04:57,014 --> 01:05:00,064
I have something to say everyone.

782
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:04,024
Please empty your schedule for this coming Wednesday

783
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:07,273
Wednesday? I have a golf appointment with Chairman Yoon that day.

784
01:05:07,273 --> 01:05:09,707
The restaurant workers and I are going out

785
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:12,473
I can't either. I'm invited to a birthday party.

786
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:13,024
Me too.

787
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:14,307
Okay.

788
01:05:14,307 --> 01:05:16,207
You all cancel.

789
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:17,107
What's this?

790
01:05:17,107 --> 01:05:18,973
What is happening on that day?

791
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:22,094
Your wedding!

792
01:05:22,094 --> 01:05:33,064
Wedding?!

793
01:05:33,064 --> 99:59:59,999

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is 26th, that's 27th."

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Streets have names; blocks are just the

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
unnamed spaces in between streets."

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you turn to a person next to you and say,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Blocks have names.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All of these blocks have names,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There's Block 17, house number one."

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The second house ever built is house number two.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, I love that sometimes we need to

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
go to the opposite side of the world

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, for example, there are doctors in China

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
(Applause)

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In most music, we think of the "one"

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But in West African music, the "one"

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
is thought of as the end of the phrase,

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
like the period at the end of a sentence.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
two, three, four, one.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And this map is also accurate.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
(Laughter)

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the opposite is also true.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that the opposite may also be true.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Domo arigato gozaimashita.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,000
In this video we're going to
talk about another way of

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,860
visualizing data called the
histogram, which is a very

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,290
fancy word for a not
so fancy thing.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,140
I think it's probably fair to
say that the histogram is the

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,840
most used way of representing
statistical data.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,390
Let me just show you how to
figure out a histogram for

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,800
some data, and I think you're
going to get the

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,520
point pretty easily.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,740
So I have some data
here and I want to

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,530
represent it with a histogram.

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,880
What we're going to see
is how frequent are

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,050
each of these numbers.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,570
And in order to figure that
out, let me just write the

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,700
numbers down, let me just
categorize them in their

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,370
respective buckets.

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,820
So I have a 1 here.

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,440

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,010
I have a 4, so I want to leave
space for the 2, the 3, and

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,430
put a 4 there.

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,820
I have a 2.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,220
I have a 1.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,280
Let me put that 1 on a stack
right above that 1.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,880
I have a 0-- let me put the
0 to the left of the 1.

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,370
I want to put them in order.

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,650
I have a 2, another 2.

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,930
Let me stack that above
my first 2.

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,100
I have another 1.

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,750
Let me stack that above
my other two 1's.

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,930
I have another 0.

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,180
Let me stack it there.

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,430
I have another 1.

33
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,120

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,360
Then I have another 2.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,700
Another 1.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,020
I have two more 0's.

37
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,910
0, 0.

38
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,175
I have two more 2's.

39
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,770

40
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,110
I have a 3.

41
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,360
I have two more 1's.

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,840

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,830
Another 3.

44
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,510
And then I have a 6.

45
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,050
So no 5's, and then
I have a 6.

46
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,480
And that space right there
was unnecessary.

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,670
But right here I've listed--
I've just rewritten those

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,620
numbers and I've essentially
categorized them.

49
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,950
Now what I want to do is
calculate how many of each of

50
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,660
these numbers we have. So
let me go down here.

51
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,539
So I want to look at
the frequency of

52
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,789
each of these numbers.

53
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,780

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,110
So I have one, two,
three, four 0's.

55
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,660
I have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven 1's.

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,250
I have one, two, three,
four, five 2's.

57
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,740
I have one, two 3's.

58
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,370
I have one 4, and one 6.

59
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,520
So we could write it this way.

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,200
We could write the number,
and then we

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,450
can have the frequency.

62
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,230

63
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,060
So I have the numbers 0, 1, 2,
3, 4-- we could even throw 5

64
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,420
in there, although 5 has
a frequency of 0.

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,780
And we have a 6.

66
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,950
So the 0 showed up four times
in this data set.

67
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,570
1 showed up seven times
in this data set.

68
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:08,890
2 showed up five times, 3 showed
up to two times, 4

69
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,560
showed up one time, 5 didn't
show up, and 6

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,820
showed up one time.

71
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,740
All I did is I counted this
data set, and I did this

72
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,760
first. But you could say how
many times do I see a 0?

73
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,600
I see it one, two, three,
four times.

74
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,940
How many times do I see a 1?

75
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,290
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven times.

76
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,690
That's what we mean
by frequency.

77
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,260
Now a histogram is really just
a plot, kind of a bar graph,

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,980
plotting the frequency of
each of these numbers.

79
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,780
It's going to look a lot
like this original

80
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,400
thing that I drew.

81
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,090
So let me draw some axes here.

82
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,040
So the different buckets
here are the numbers.

83
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,930
And that worked out because
we're dealing with very clean

84
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,570
integers that tend to repeat.

85
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,520
If you're dealing with things
that the exact number doesn't

86
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,650
repeat, oftentimes people
will put the numbers

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,450
into buckets or ranges.

88
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,190
But here they fit into
nice little buckets.

89
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:08,540
You have the numbers 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

90
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,870
This is the actual numbers.

91
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,505
And then on the vertical
axis we're

92
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:15,190
going to plot the frequency.

93
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,430
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

94
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,690
So that's 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

95
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,370
So 0 shows up four times.

96
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,860
So we'll draw a little
bar graph here.

97
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,980
0 shows up four times.

98
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,140
Draw it just like that.

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,210
0 shows up four times.

100
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,150
That is that information
right there.

101
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,540
1 shows up seven times.

102
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,680
So I'll do a little bar graph.

103
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,520
1 shows up seven times.

104
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,630
Just like that.

105
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,740
I want to make it a little bit
straighter than that-- 1 shows

106
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,190
up seven times.

107
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,890

108
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,335
2-- I'll do it in a different
color-- 2 shows up five times.

109
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,930

110
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,260
Do a bar graph, go all
the way up to five.

111
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,910
2 shows up five times.

112
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,650
3 shows up two times.

113
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,460

114
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,210
We have one 3, two 3's.

115
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,240
4 shows up one time here.

116
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,100

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,680
5 doesn't show up at all.

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,100
So it doesn't even get
any height there.

119
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:44,140
And then finally, 6
shows up one time.

120
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,140
So I'll do 6 showing
up one time.

121
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,460
What I just plotted here,
this is a histogram.

122
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,850
This right here is
a histogram.

123
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,890
Very fancy word, but I think you
will agree it's a fairly

124
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,100
simple idea.

125
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,940
Figure out the frequency of each
of these numbers and then

126
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,840
plot the frequency of each of
these numbers and you get

127
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,090
yourself a histogram.

128
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,133

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,340
We're asked to multiply 5/6
times 2/3 and then simplify

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,570
our answer.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,450
So let's just multiply
these two numbers.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,090
So we have 5/6 times 2/3.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,030
Now when you're multiplying
fractions, it's actually a

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,470
pretty straightforward
process.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,190
The new numerator, or the
numerator of the product, is

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,880
just the product of the two
numerators, or your new top

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,340
number is a product of the
other two top numbers.

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,240
So the numerator in our product
is just 5 times 2.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,250
So it's equal to 5 times 2 over
6 times 3, which is equal

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,490
to-- 5 times 2 is 10 and
6 times 3 is 18, so

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,710
it's equal to 10/18.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,820
And you could view this as
either 2/3 of 5/6 or 5/6 of

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
2/3, depending on how you
want to think about it.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,750
And this is the right answer.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,220
It is 10/18, but when you look
at these two numbers, you

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,460
immediately or you might
immediately see that they

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,500
share some common factors.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,990
They're both divisible by 2,
so if we want it in lowest

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,020
terms, we want to divide
them both by 2.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,800
So divide 10 by 2, divide 18 by
2, and you get 10 divided

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,510
by 2 is 5, 18 divided
by 2 is 9.

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,920
Now, you could have essentially
done this step

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,630
earlier on.

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,530
You could've done it actually
before we did the

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,220
multiplication.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,450
You could've done
it over here.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,450
You could've said, well, I have
a 2 in the numerator and

31
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,260
I have something divisible by 2
into the denominator, so let

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,710
me divide the numerator by
2, and this becomes a 1.

33
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,090
Let me divide the denominator
by 2, and this becomes a 3.

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,070
And then you have 5 times 1
is 5, and 3 times 3 is 9.

35
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,200
So it's really the same thing
we did right here.

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,370
We just did it before we
actually took the product.

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,220
You could actually
do it right here.

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,890
So if you did it right over
here, you'd say, well, look, 6

39
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,190
times 3 is eventually going
to be the denominator.

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,030
5 times 2 is eventually going
to be the numerator.

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,660
So let's divide the numerator by
2, so this will become a 1.

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,180
Let's divide the denominator
by 2.

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,550
This is divisible by 2,
so that'll become a 3.

44
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,630
And it'll become 5 times 1
is 5 and 3 times 3 is 9.

45
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,210
So either way you do
it, it'll work.

46
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,450
If you do it this way, you get
to see the things factored out

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,910
a little bit more, so it's
usually easier to recognize

48
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,200
what's divisible by what, or you
could do it at the end and

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
put things in lowest terms.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,867

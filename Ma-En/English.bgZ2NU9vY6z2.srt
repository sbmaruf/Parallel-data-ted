1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,421

2
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:02,170
In this video, I want
to talk a little bit

3
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,264
about what it means
to be a prime number.

4
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:07,680
And what you'll
see in this video,

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,650
or you'll hopefully
see in this video,

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,840
is it's a pretty
straightforward concept.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,097
But as you progress through
your mathematical careers,

8
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,680
you'll see that there's actually
fairly sophisticated concepts

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,030
that can be built on top of
the idea of a prime number.

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,277
And that includes the
idea of cryptography.

11
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,610
And maybe some of the encryption
that your computer uses

12
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,879
right now could be
based on prime numbers.

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,545
If you don't know
what encryption means,

14
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,450
you don't have to worry
about it right now.

15
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,410
You just need to know the prime
numbers are pretty important.

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,092
So I'll give you a definition.

17
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,050
And the definition might
be a little confusing,

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,600
but when we see
it with examples,

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,680
it should hopefully be
pretty straightforward.

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,790
So a number is prime if
it is a natural number--

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,740
and a natural number, once
again, just as an example,

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,130
these are like the numbers 1, 2,
3, so essentially the counting

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,020
numbers starting
at 1, or you could

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,450
say the positive integers.

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:11,740
It is a natural number divisible
by exactly two numbers,

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,240
or two other natural numbers.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,698
Actually I shouldn't
say two other,

28
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:17,630
I should say two
natural numbers.

29
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,870
So it's not two other
natural numbers--

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,190
divisible by exactly
two natural numbers.

31
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:31,130
One of those numbers is itself,
and the other one is one.

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,380
Those are the two numbers
that it is divisible by.

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,740
And that's why I didn't
want to say exactly

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,120
two other natural numbers,
because one of the numbers

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,866
is itself.

36
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,490
And if this doesn't
make sense for you,

37
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,030
let's just do some
examples here,

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,640
and let's figure out if some
numbers are prime or not.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200
So let's start with the smallest
natural number-- the number 1.

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,430
So you might say, look,
1 is divisible by 1

41
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,220
and it is divisible by itself.

42
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,860
You might say, hey,
1 is a prime number.

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,550
But remember, part
of our definition--

44
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,620
it needs to be divisible by
exactly two natural numbers.

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,640
1 is divisible by only one
natural number-- only by 1.

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,259
So 1, although it might be
a little counter intuitive

47
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:15,590
is not prime.

48
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,680
Let's move on to 2.

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,490

50
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,890
So 2 is divisible by
1 and by 2 and not

51
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,940
by any other natural numbers.

52
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,150
So it seems to meet
our constraint.

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,950
It's divisible by exactly
two natural numbers-- itself,

54
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,240
that's 2 right there, and 1.

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,685
So 2 is prime.

56
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,610

57
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,580
And I'll circle
the prime numbers.

58
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,289
I'll circle them.

59
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,329
Well actually, let me do
it in a different color,

60
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,320
since I already used
that color for the-- I'll

61
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,220
just circle them.

62
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,500
I'll circle the
numbers that are prime.

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,630
And 2 is interesting
because it is

64
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,180
the only even number
that is prime.

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,060
If you think about it,
any other even number

66
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,480
is also going to be
divisible by 2, above

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,860
and beyond 1 and itself.

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,030
So it won't be prime.

69
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,470
We'll think about that
more in future videos.

70
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,480
Let's try out 3.

71
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,582
Well, 3 is definitely
divisible by 1 and 3.

72
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:12,790
And it's really not divisible
by anything in between.

73
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not divisible by 2, so
3 is also a prime number.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,700
Let's try 4.

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,860
I'll switch to
another color here.

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,080
Let's try 4.

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,960
Well, 4 is definitely
divisible by 1 and 4.

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,030
But it's also divisible by 2.

79
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,200
2 times 2 is 4.

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,490
It's also divisible by 2.

81
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,730
So it's divisible by three
natural numbers-- 1, 2, and 4.

82
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,680
So it does not meet our
constraints for being prime.

83
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Let's try out 5.

84
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,270
So 5 is definitely
divisible by 1.

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,740
It's not divisible by 2.

86
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,900
It's not divisible by 3.

87
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,149
It's not exactly divisible by 4.

88
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,690
You could divide them into it,
but you would get a remainder.

89
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,860
But it is exactly
divisible by 5, obviously.

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,350
So once again, it's divisible
by exactly two natural numbers--

91
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,280
1 and 5.

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,586
So, once again, 5 is prime.

93
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,960
Let's keep going,
just so that we

94
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,340
see if there's any
kind of a pattern here.

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,390
And then maybe I'll
try a really hard one

96
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,130
that tends to trip people up.

97
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,350
So let's try the number.

98
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,300
6.

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,470
It is divisible by 1.

100
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,940
It is divisible by 2.

101
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,270
It is divisible by 3.

102
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,190
Not 4 or 5, but it
is divisible by 6.

103
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,290
So it has four natural
number factors.

104
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,010
I guess you could
say it that way.

105
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,940
And so it does not have
exactly two numbers

106
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,450
that it is divisible by.

107
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,610
It has four, so it is not prime.

108
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's move on to 7.

109
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,330
7 is divisible by 1, not 2,
not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6.

110
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,160
But it's also divisible by 7.

111
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,020
So 7 is prime.

112
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,640
I think you get the
general idea here.

113
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,560
How many natural
numbers-- numbers

114
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,090
like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the numbers
that you learned when you were

115
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,490
two years old, not including 0,
not including negative numbers,

116
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,340
not including fractions and
irrational numbers and decimals

117
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,250
and all the rest, just regular
counting positive numbers.

118
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,270
If you have only two
of them, if you're only

119
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,140
divisible by yourself and
one, then you are prime.

120
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,640
And the way I think
about it-- if we

121
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,540
don't think about the
special case of 1,

122
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,440
prime numbers are kind of these
building blocks of numbers.

123
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,899
You can't break
them down anymore

124
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,190
they're almost like the
atoms-- if you think about what

125
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,606
an atom is, or
what people thought

126
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:36,990
atoms were when
they first-- they

127
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,860
thought it was kind of the
thing that you couldn't divide

128
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,190
anymore.

129
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,850
We now know that you
could divide atoms

130
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,308
and, actually, if
you do, you might

131
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,540
create a nuclear explosion.

132
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,790
But it's the same idea
behind prime numbers.

133
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,750
In theory-- and in prime
numbers, it's not theory,

134
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,380
we know you can't
break them down

135
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,370
into products of
smaller natural numbers.

136
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,320
Things like 6-- you could
say, hey, 6 is 2 times 3.

137
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,280
You can break it down.

138
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,290
And notice we can break it down
as a product of prime numbers.

139
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,740
We've kind of broken
it down into its parts.

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,930
7, you can't break
it down anymore.

141
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,346
All you can say is that
7 is equal to 1 times 7,

142
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:15,720
and in that case, you really
haven't broken it down much.

143
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,690
You just have the 7 there again.

144
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,440
6 you can actually
break it down.

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,302
4 you can actually break
it down as 2 times 2.

146
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:24,760
Now with that out of the way,
let's think about some larger

147
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,910
numbers, and think about whether
those larger numbers are prime.

148
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,870
So let's try 16.

149
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,750
So clearly, any number is
divisible by 1 and itself.

150
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,700
Any number, any natural
number you put up here

151
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,242
is going to be
divisible by 1 and 16.

152
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,866
So you're always
going to start with 2.

153
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,150
So if you can find anything
else that goes into this,

154
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,060
then you know you're not prime.

155
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,620
And 16, you could have 2 times
8, you could have 4 times 4.

156
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
So it's got a ton
of factors here

157
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,720
above and beyond
just the 1 and 16.

158
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,410
So 16 is not prime.

159
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,340
What about 17?

160
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,500
1 and 17 will
definitely go into 17.

161
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,700
2 doesn't go into 17.

162
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,530
3 doesn't go.

163
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,650
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11--
none of those numbers,

164
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,360
nothing between 1
and 17 goes into 17.

165
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,130
So 17 is prime.

166
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,920
And now I'll give
you a hard one.

167
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,350
This one can trick
a lot of people.

168
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,610
What about 51?

169
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,555
Is 51 prime?

170
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:33,022

171
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,480
And if you're
interested, maybe you

172
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,390
could pause the
video here and try

173
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,060
to figure out for yourself
if 51 is a prime number.

174
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,520
If you can find anything
other than 1 or 51

175
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,740
that is divisible into 51.

176
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,130
It seems like, wow, this is
kind of a strange number.

177
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,430
You might be tempted
to think it's prime.

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,720
But I'm now going to give you
the answer-- it is not prime,

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,030
because it is also
divisible by 3 and 17.

180
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,420
3 times 17 is 51.

181
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,045
So hopefully that
gives you a good idea

182
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:05,590
of what prime numbers
are all about.

183
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,260
And hopefully we can
give you some practice

184
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,738
on that in future videos or
maybe some of our exercises.

185
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:12,238

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Please close your eyes,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and open your hands.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now imagine what you could place in your hands:

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
an apple, maybe your wallet.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now open your eyes.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What about a life?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What you see here is a premature baby.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because he can't regulate his own body temperature.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
enough fat on his body to stay warm.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sadly, 20 million babies like this

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
are born every year around the world.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Four million of these babies die annually.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
grow up with severe, long-term health problems.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
its only job is to grow.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
resulting in a range of health problems

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
from diabetes, to heart disease,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to low I.Q.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
if these babies were just kept warm.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That is the primary function of an incubator.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But traditional incubators require electricity

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As a result, parents resort to local solutions

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and the doctor advised her to take Rani

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But that hospital was over four hours away,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so her baby died.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
something that could work without electricity,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
given that the majority of births still take place in the home.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We needed something that was portable,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and something ultra-low-cost,

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
compared to the 20,000 dollars

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that an incubator in the U.S. costs.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, this is what we came up with.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is a phase-change material.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can melt this simply using hot water

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
for four to six hours at a time,

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
after which you simply reheat the pouch.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and it creates a warm micro-environment

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
for the baby.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and the target price point will be 25 dollars,

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
less than 0.1 percent of the cost

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
of a traditional incubator.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
of almost a million babies.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This seems counterintuitive,

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
population sizes also decrease,

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because parents don't need to anticipate

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that their babies are going to die.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and other simple innovations like this

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
represent a new trend for the future of technology:

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
simple, localized, affordable solutions

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that have the potential to make huge social impact.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We really tried to understand the end user,

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
in this case, people like Sevitha.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We tried to understand the root of the problem

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
rather than being biased by what already exists.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to address this problem.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.

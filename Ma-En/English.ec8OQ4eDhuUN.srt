1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,750
We're asked to simplify 8 plus
5 times 4 minus, and then in

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,010
parentheses, 6 plus 10
divided by 2 plus 44.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,120
Whenever you see some type of
crazy expression like this

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,360
where you have parentheses and
addition and subtraction and

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
division, you always want
to keep the order of

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,000
operations in mind.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,970
Let me write them
down over here.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,420
So when you're doing order of
operations, or really when

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,820
you're evaluating any
expression, you should have

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,520
this in the front of your brain
that the top priority

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,770
goes to parentheses.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,060
And those are these little
brackets over here, or however

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,670
you want to call them.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,320
Those are the parentheses
right there.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,030
That gets top priority.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,120
Then after that, you want to
worry about exponents.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,240
There are no exponents in this
expression, but I'll just

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,150
write it down just for future
reference: exponents.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,000
One way I like to think about it
is parentheses always takes

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,730
top priority, but then after
that, we go in descending

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,610
order, or I guess we should
say in-- well, yeah, in

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,400
descending order of how fast
that computation is.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,520
When I say fast, how
fast it grows.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,800
When I take something to an
exponent, when I'm taking

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,270
something to a power, it grows
really fast. Then it grows a

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,730
little bit slower or shrinks
a little bit slower if I

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,760
multiply or divide,
so that comes

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,800
next: multiply or divide.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,910
Multiplication and division
comes next, and then last of

30
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,550
all comes addition
and subtraction.

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,950
So these are kind of the
slowest operations.

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,450
This is a little bit faster.

33
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,610
This is the fastest operation.

34
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,290
And then the parentheses,
just no matter

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,980
what, always take priority.

36
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,180
So let's apply it over here.

37
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,290
Let me rewrite this
whole expression.

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,960
So it's 8 plus 5 times 4 minus,
in parentheses, 6 plus

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,150
10 divided by 2 plus 44.

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,730
So we're going to want to do the
parentheses first. We have

41
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,050
parentheses there and there.

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,170
Now this parentheses is pretty
straightforward.

43
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,120
Well, inside the parentheses
is already evaluated, so we

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,009
could really just view
this as 5 times 4.

45
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,000
So let's just evaluate that
right from the get go.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,935
So this is going to result in
8 plus-- and really, when

47
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,650
you're evaluating the
parentheses, if your evaluate

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,980
this parentheses, you literally
just get 5, and you

49
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,070
evaluate that parentheses, you
literally just get 4, and then

50
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,930
they're next to each other,
so you multiply them.

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,170
So 5 times 4 is 20 minus--
let me stay

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,960
consistent with the colors.

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,290
Now let me write the next
parenthesis right there, and

54
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,050
then inside of it, we'd evaluate
this first. Let me

55
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,080
close the parenthesis
right there.

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
And then we have plus 44.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,250
So what is this thing right here
evaluate to, this thing

58
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,800
inside the parentheses?

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,170
Well, you might be tempted
to say, well, let me

60
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,160
just go left to right.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,770
6 plus 10 is 16 and then
divide by 2 and

62
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,780
you would get 8.

63
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,080
But remember: order
of operations.

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,760
Division takes priority over
addition, so you actually want

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,850
to do the division first, and
we could actually write it

66
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,790
here like this.

67
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,960
You could imagine putting
some more parentheses.

68
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,790
Let me do it in that
same purple.

69
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,200
You could imagine putting some
more parentheses right here to

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,110
really emphasize the fact that
you're going to do the

71
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,760
division first.

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,740
So 10 divided by 2 is 5, so this
will result in 6, plus 10

73
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,560
divided by 2, is 5.

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,730
6 plus 5.

75
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,230
Well, we still have to evaluate
this parentheses, so

76
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,600
this results-- what's
6 plus 5?

77
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,050
Well, that's 11.

78
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,630
So we're left with
the 20-- let me

79
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,630
write it all down again.

80
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,050
We're left with 8 plus
20 minus 6 plus 5,

81
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,000
which is 11, plus 44.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,820
And now that we have everything
at this level of

83
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,580
operations, we can just
go left to right.

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,770
So 8 plus 20 is 28, so you
can view this as 28

85
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,890
minus 11 plus 44.

86
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,030
28 minus 11-- 28 minus 10
would be 18, so this

87
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,386
is going to be 17.

88
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:10,630
It's going to be 17 plus 44.

89
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,209
And then 17 plus 44-- I'll
scroll down a little bit.

90
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,160
7 plus 44 would be 51, so
this is going to be 61.

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,940
So this is going to
be equal to 61.

92
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,460
And we're done!

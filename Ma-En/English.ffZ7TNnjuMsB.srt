1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,699
SAL KHAN: I'm here with
the Dr. Laura Bachrach

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,850
at Stanford Medical School.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,280
And what are we
going to talk about?

4
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:05,846
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
We're going to talk

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,830
about normal and abnormal
growth in children.

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,280
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

7
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,466
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So this
is an important concern.

8
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,900
Parents really worry if their
child is growing normally.

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,940
And physicians worry
about this too,

10
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,570
because the change in height is
an important barometer of how

11
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,980
the child is doing overall,
in terms of health.

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,730
So to begin to assess the
child's growth pattern,

13
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,105
we have to think about what
are the determinants of where

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,900
the child should be
on the growth curve.

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,650
The number one most important
determinant, of course,

16
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,050
is genetics.

17
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,589
Short parents are
more likely to have

18
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,270
short children and vice versa.

19
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,570
SAL KHAN: And that's true
even when a child is young,

20
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:44,282
because sometimes I've
seen the opposite.

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,310
So people who are petite
have large children

22
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,022
and all the rest.

23
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,940
But it is true that,
if someone is large,

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,940
they're more likely to
have large children, even

25
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,820
infants and toddlers.

26
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:55,855
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: You've hit
upon a really important issue

27
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,710
that's shown here in this slide.

28
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,580
The size of a baby at
birth isn't necessarily

29
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,990
going to reflect the genetics.

30
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,370
There are babies that are
born small, because mother

31
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,780
didn't have prenatal care.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,670
Mother was a smoker,
other factors

33
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,340
that compromise the
growth of the child.

34
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,760
And those babies
can be born small

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,680
for their gestational age.

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,790
During the first two
to three years of life,

37
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,000
they have a chance to
catch up on the curve

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,270
and reach what's called
their genetic potential.

39
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,990
SAL KHAN: So let's
just make sure.

40
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:25,817
I want to make sure.

41
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,940
I've seen these
curves before, when

42
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,440
I went to visit a
pediatrician, even

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,190
I remember this when I used to
visit the pediatrician, which

44
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,690
I did maybe a little too long.

45
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,650
So this axis right
over here is age.

46
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,900
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In months.

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,420
SAL KHAN: In months-- so
this is right here birth.

48
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,800
This is birth.

49
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,810
So if a baby is born
at-- I don't know.

50
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,272
This is the weight
right over here.

51
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,080
So if a baby is born at five
pounds-- is this in pounds?

52
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,970
This is kilograms.

53
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,960
OK, so five pounds
is right over.

54
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:55,537
Is that right?

55
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,770
Yeah, five pounds would
be right over here.

56
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,620
So this would be a baby
born at five pounds.

57
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,085
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right.

58
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,130
And I'm talking more here,
during this growth lecture,

59
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,010
about the height or
length of the baby,

60
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,329
throughout babyhood
and childhood.

61
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,500
But let's say, the baby
were born light in weight

62
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,850
and short in length.

63
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,320
SAL KHAN: So maybe
18 inches right here

64
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,330
would be a short length.

65
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,130
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Right, and let's say,

66
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,110
that baby was small
because his mother

67
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,040
had issues during the pregnancy.

68
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:28,915
SAL KHAN: Is it always
the case that the baby

69
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,390
will be small because of issues?

70
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,470
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: No.

71
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,160
The bottom line is
that genetics plays

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,060
less of a part in the
size of the baby at birth

73
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:39,522
than it will later
on in childhood.

74
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,490
SAL KHAN: All right,
it makes sense.

75
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,590
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So to
come back to your point,

76
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,560
you'll meet parents
whose baby seem

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,770
to be larger or
smaller than they are.

78
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,100
But by age three the
child should be--

79
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,312
SAL KHAN: Hold on one second.

80
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,930
Let me just close this.

81
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,430
OK.

82
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,800
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
By age three,

83
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:58,594
the child should be in
his or her genetic groove,

84
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,200
if you will.

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,070
SAL KHAN: I see.

86
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,530
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
So there can be

87
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,178
movement on the growth curve
in the first two to three years

88
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,710
of life.

89
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,160
There can be catch-up growth,
where the child, who was small,

90
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,120
let's say, moves
from below the curve

91
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,140
up to the 50th percentile,
by age 24 months.

92
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:14,564
SAL KHAN: So this
would be a child

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,770
who does something like this.

94
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:18,698
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Exactly, exactly.

95
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,730
And you can have the converse,
where you have a very big baby.

96
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,110
Let's say, mother had
uncontrolled diabetes,

97
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,590
and the baby was
born very large.

98
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,820
That baby can have catch-down
growth, to the 50th percentile.

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,690
By the age of three, certainly
movement across percentiles

100
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,650
is considered to be abnormal
and warrants an investigation.

101
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,460
SAL KHAN: So you really can
predict someone's even adult

102
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,070
height, based on
where they at three?

103
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:48,805
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: A general
rule of thumb is, that by age 2

104
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,450
and 1/2 to 3, the child is
in their genetic groove.

105
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,770
SAL KHAN: Really?

106
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,470
Oh, wow.

107
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,460
I didn't realize that
quickly you can kind of--

108
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,370
so if a child, at
age three or four,

109
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,170
is in the 25th
percentile in height,

110
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,360
it's unlikely that they're
going to be in the NBA?

111
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,222
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In
general, that's true.

112
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,420
There are a few exceptions.

113
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,750
There are late
bloomers, what we call

114
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,990
a constitutional
delay of growth.

115
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,580
But a general rule
would be, what

116
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,710
percentile you are by
the age of two or three

117
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,500
is pretty much where
you're going to track,

118
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,041
if all things are
going normally.

119
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,970
SAL KHAN: Wow, I never
realized that it was that soon.

120
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,470
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And genetics
is an important determinant

121
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,520
as I said.

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
We can actually do a
calculation of where

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,020
we think a child should end
up, the so-called mid-parental

124
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,000
height, which we are
going to talk about later.

125
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,930
So genetics is the
critical factor.

126
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,950
But whether or not you
reach your genetic potential

127
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,750
means that the cards have to
be lined up appropriately.

128
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,860
So the cards that are
important for achieving

129
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,570
your genetic potentials, first
of all, number one-- normal

130
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,430
amounts of hormones that
are important for growing.

131
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,120
And those are thyroid and growth
hormone, to a large extent.

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,910
A second factor, of course,
is adequate nutrition.

133
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,860
And we think
worldwide of children

134
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,820
who are undernourished,
who don't look anywhere

135
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,540
near their age, in
terms of height,

136
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,960
because they're
so undernourished.

137
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,120
It really cramps their style.

138
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:14,305
SAL KHAN: And you see
the reverse of that.

139
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,350
I mean, I don't know
what I am officially.

140
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,024
I was born here.

141
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,610
My parents weren't.

142
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,180
So I'm what, first generation
or second generation.

143
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,865
But you see that in
that, is that you

144
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,790
see a lot of people
in my generation

145
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,670
are much taller
than their parents,

146
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,140
because their
parents were probably

147
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,350
malnourished in some way.

148
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,010
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Certainly, there

149
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,370
can be a secular trend,
where the children get taller

150
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,150
than the parents,
if the children have

151
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,830
a different environment.

152
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,370
The other thing we notice
about nutrition in our country

153
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,640
is the over-nutrition
of our children.

154
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,080
And what happens with obesity is
that children may grow faster,

155
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,160
in terms of both weight
and height for their age.

156
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,220
They don't end up
taller in the long run.

157
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,710
But they move ahead more quickly
through the maturation process.

158
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:55,384
SAL KHAN: I see.

159
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,960
I didn't know.

160
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:56,953
OK, it can accelerate.

161
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,690
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly.

162
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,017
SAL KHAN: I never realized that.

163
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,810
That's fascinating.

164
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,352
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
And then we think

165
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:04,543
about psychosocial factors.

166
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,500
There literally is
a situation where

167
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,690
infants can be deprived of
parental love and support,

168
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,350
and you see something
dwarfing there.

169
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,290
In a teenager, we see problems
with eating disorders,

170
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,290
that's a cross between nutrition
and a psychological problem.

171
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,117
So psychosocial factors
play a role as well.

172
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,550
SAL KHAN: So they've
shown, or it's

173
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,380
been seen that it's
noticeable changes

174
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,770
in physical development,
based on, I guess,

175
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,040
attention and love.

176
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,752
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Yes, there's actually

177
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,840
a syndrome called
psychosocial dwarfism, where

178
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,700
you can actually see
a slow down in growing

179
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,280
without adequate
interpersonal support.

180
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,040
SAL KHAN: Wow,
that's fascinating.

181
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:43,715
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So
the issue is, when do you

182
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,470
need to worry about a
child's growth pattern?

183
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,260
In order to interpret
that, you have

184
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,580
to understand about the
variability in growth.

185
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,730
In the first two to
three years of life,

186
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,240
children grow much more quickly
than they will later on.

187
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,710
By the age of three,
until they hit puberty,

188
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,010
children should grow
two inches a year.

189
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,436
SAL KHAN: Two inches a year,
this is from the ages of--

190
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,104
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
After they're out of

191
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,610
toddlerhood until
they hit puberty.

192
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:12,404
SAL KHAN: So this is
like three to puberty.

193
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:14,845
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Exactly, exactly.

194
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,910
But when kids will hit puberty
is going to be variable.

195
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,940
And so that's an issue.

196
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,360
If children are growing
at a normal rate,

197
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,130
it's not necessary to
memorize the inches per year.

198
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,040
Children will track
along the growth curve.

199
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,010
And if we can turn to the
next slide or next graph,

200
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,950
this is a graph for what
we use for older children,

201
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,700
after the age of 2
up until they're 18.

202
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,680
This is the curve that we use.

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,040
Now, beyond the age
of two, I said to you,

204
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,020
it's not normal for children to
necessarily cross percentiles.

205
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,900
So if, for example,
you have a child

206
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,570
who is tracking along the
fifth percentile every year,

207
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,930
growing their two inches a year.

208
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,507
SAL KHAN: This is
the fifth down here?

209
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,510
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right,
the lower line there.

210
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,780
They're moving along,
steadily, steadily, steadily.

211
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,770
That child has a more reassuring
growth curve than one,

212
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,080
for example, who
as a five-year-old

213
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,790
had been at the
top of the curve.

214
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,156
SAL KHAN: Right,
a five-year-old.

215
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,670
So five-year-old is right there.

216
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,415
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
And then the next year

217
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,505
is on the 75th
moving down a line.

218
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,475
SAL KHAN: I see.

219
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,050
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
And the year after

220
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,623
is on the 50th percentile.

221
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,560
Now, at that point
in time, the child

222
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,450
has theoretically
a normal height

223
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,310
because it's within the curve.

224
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,010
But there's something very
abnormal about that rate

225
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:34,505
of growing.

226
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:38,034
And that's the child that's
more worrisome than the shorter

227
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:38,531
child.

228
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,960
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

229
00:08:39,961 --> 00:08:41,421
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
So bottom line,

230
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,069
when a child would
come in to present

231
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,670
to me because of a
concern about growing,

232
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,290
I'd first of all try to
decide if they're are short

233
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,617
and if they're growing normally.

234
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,260
And those are two
different questions.

235
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,350
The first question
is, are they short?

236
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,930
And are they short
can be defined

237
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,630
by looking at these curves.

238
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,140
These are curves
representing the spectrum

239
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,040
of normal height for a
healthy American youth.

240
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,610
And they go from the 5th
to the 95th percentile.

241
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,952
So you can compare a child
to the population as a whole.

242
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,170
But I also like
to calculate what

243
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,510
we call the mid-parental height.

244
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,560
OK, this is where
we take into account

245
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,500
the heights of the
parents, because that's

246
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,120
the most important determinant.

247
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,580
So how we calculate
that is as follows.

248
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,820
We take the height of mom
and dad and average them.

249
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,370
SAL KHAN: OK, let's do that.

250
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,150
So I'm 5' 9", if I'm
wearing decent shoes.

251
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,112
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

252
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,510
SAL KHAN: So set
that to 69 inches.

253
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,730
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

254
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,710
And how tall is the
mother of your children?

255
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,800
SAL KHAN: She's 5' 6".

256
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,370
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: She's 5' 6".

257
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,100
SAL KHAN: Which is why I don't
let her wear too large heels.

258
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,060
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

259
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,790
And are we trying to calculate
your son or your daughter?

260
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,010
SAL KHAN: Let's do my son,
since he's a little older.

261
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,470
So let's see, it's
plus 66 inches.

262
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,432
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

263
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,370
So we'll take the
midpoint of that.

264
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,540
SAL KHAN: OK, so that's
really an inch and 1/2.

265
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,130
So it's what, 67 and 1/2
inches between me and my wife.

266
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,207
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right.

267
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,920
And we're going to
add 2 and 1/2 inches.

268
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,720
SAL KHAN: OK.

269
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,440
So that gets us what,
to exactly 70 inches.

270
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,945
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right.

271
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,380
And that's the height
prediction for your son.

272
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,381
SAL KHAN: Oh, very good.

273
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,310
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Plus or minus--

274
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,630
SAL KHAN: Oh, plus or minus.

275
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,350
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: 4 inches.

276
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,300
SAL KHAN: Plus or
minus 4 inches,

277
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,420
oh, that's a big difference.

278
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,170
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
It's a big difference.

279
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,780
But that's the nature
of human variability.

280
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,500
SAL KHAN: I see.

281
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,460
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

282
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,538
Now, if this were
your daughter, we

283
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:30,565
would take the 67 and 1/2 inches
and subtract 2 and 1/2 inches.

284
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,800
Let's do that.

285
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:34,395
SAL KHAN: OK, so that
gets us 65, so 5' 5"

286
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:36,564
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly,
plus or minus 4 inches.

287
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,220
SAL KHAN: Plus or
minus 4 inches.

288
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:40,144
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So
that's something we do.

289
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,670
We then calculate-- in
fact, let's plot that,

290
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,570
right on the curve.

291
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,870
This is the boys' curve, so
let's plot the 70 inches.

292
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:53,845
SAL KHAN: 70 inches is
right over here, OK.

293
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,690
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And
then the range of 74.

294
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,710
SAL KHAN: 74 to 66.

295
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:02,037
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right,
exactly-- pretty broad range.

296
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,580
SAL KHAN: Yes.

297
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,540
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

298
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,898
But if we had a child who was
growing well below the curve

299
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,560
and we thought the
midpoint should

300
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,960
be about the 50th
percentile, that child

301
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,450
would be short for the family.

302
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,600
So we always like to take the
family heights into account.

303
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,200
So number one question,
is the child's short?

304
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,440
It will depend on what
the height prediction is.

305
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,130
SAL KHAN: I see.

306
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,170
So if my son was tracking
down here at the 5%.

307
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,039
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: That
would be concerning.

308
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,973
SAL KHAN: Even if he's growing
the two inches every year

309
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,540
and he's tracking that, it
still would be concerning.

310
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,050
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Well, it
would raise some questions

311
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,100
in our minds.

312
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,900
But that's the more
important factor is not just

313
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,860
where they on the
curve at the moment.

314
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,640
But are they growing
at the normal rate?

315
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,280
And the child who is not
growing at the normal rate

316
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,960
raises more red
flags than the child

317
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,220
who's trotting up the curve.

318
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,140
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

319
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:50,306
That's interesting, wow.

320
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,485
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
So that's the issue.

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,700
And that's what we
approach every day.

322
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,440
We want to look into
the various causes,

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
potentially, for
growth slowdown.

324
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,130
We want to address treatment
to the specific etiology.

325
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,680
SAL KHAN: And etiology means--

326
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,335
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Well, for example,

327
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,800
if the child has a deficiency
of thyroid hormone,

328
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,870
we want to give
thyroid hormone back.

329
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,280
SAL KHAN: So etiology
is like the cause.

330
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,530
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: The cause.

331
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,229
If the child isn't growing
because he has a nutritional

332
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,670
problem, like Celiac
Disease, we want

333
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,170
to put him on a special
diet to address that issue.

334
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,240
Some parents think,
well, what we

335
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,050
want to do-- my child is

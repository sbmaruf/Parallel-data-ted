00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:28,075
Hill tribes in the Golden Triangle (of Thailand Laos and Myanmar) were once cultivating opium as a cash crop.

2
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,049
In 1984, with the encouragement of the Thai monarch, King Bhumibol,

3
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:36,033
they switched to Arabica Coffee.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,066
So successful was this initiative that some of the best coffees in the world

5
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,060
are to be found growing in this region.

6
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:48,042
In Doi Chaang or Elephant Mountain in Northern Thailand,

7
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,081
the Akha hill tribes have been a role model for successfully

8
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:55,035
cultivating, processing and marketing of their coffee worldwide.

9
00:00:55,031 --> 00:01:01,031
Here, in the cool highlands, amidst pear, peach and macadamia nut trees,

10
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:06,053
Arabica coffee thrives best, producing coffee cherries that have

11
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:17,014
a more complex and intense flavour, low in caffeine and therefore less bitter.

12
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:21,063
The Akha hill tribes together with other hill tribes have been living along the borders

13
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:25,094
of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar for the past 2000 years.

14
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:29,035
Recently they have settled in  Northern Thailand to avoid

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:36,010
persecution and harassment from other neighbouring Governments.

16
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:40,032
After 20 years of successful cultivation, the Akha villagers

17
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:44,026
have established themselves as independent coffee producers

18
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,011
building their own processing, R &amp; D facilities and marketing outlets,

19
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:54,056
selling their coffee throughout Thailand, Asia and America.

20
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,010
If you are searching for that best cup than you have to look no further

21
00:02:02,006 --> 99:59:58,996
than in the Golden Triangle.

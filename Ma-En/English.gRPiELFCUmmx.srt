[adding new users]

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,270
This is Chrome.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,609
This is your Chrome,

4
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:09,000
and your friend's, Chrome,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,990
and your roommate's, Chrome,

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,820
each with a different set of bookmarks, apps, extensions, and other settings.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,390
If you share a computer with other people,

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,699
you may not want your Chrome stuff getting mixed up with everyone else's.

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,740
Now, you can add new users to Chrome,

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,210
so you can keep everyone's, stuff separate

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,490
on the same computer.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,360
A badge in the corner makes it easy to tell everyone's, Chrome windows apart,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,300
and clicking the badge makes it easy to flip between users.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,390
Each user can also sign in to Chrome to bring their Chrome stuff to all their other devices.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,780
To add a new user to Chrome, go to Options (or Preferences on a Mac),

16
00:00:52,780 --> 99:59:59,999
click Personal Stuff, and select, "Add new user."

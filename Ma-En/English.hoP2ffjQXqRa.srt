1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,730
I now want to solve some
inequalities that also have

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,550
absolute values in them.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,900
And if there's any topic in
algebra that probably confuses

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,260
people the most, it's this.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,890
But if we kind of keep our head
on straight about what

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,620
absolute value really means, I
think you will find that it's

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,650
not that bad.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,810
So let's start with a nice,
fairly simple warm-up problem.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:27,370
Let's start with the absolute
value of x is less than 12.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,740
So remember what I told
you about the

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,420
meaning of absolute value.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,890
It means how far away
you are from 0.

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,390
So one way to say this is, what
are all of the x's that

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,120
are less than 12 away from 0?

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,370
Let's draw a number line.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,120
So if we have 0 here, and we
want all the numbers that are

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,100
less than 12 away from 0, well,
you could go all the way

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,570
to positive 12, and you could go
all the way to negative 12.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,820
Anything that's in between these
two numbers is going to

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,360
have an absolute value
of less than 12.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,550
It's going to be less
than 12 away from 0.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,020
So this, you could say, this
could be all of the numbers

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,310
where x is greater
than negative 12.

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,220
Those are definitely going to
have an absolute value less

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,050
than 12, as long as they're
also-- and, x has to

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,520
be less than 12.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,170
So if an x meets both of these
constraints, its absolute

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,890
value is definitely going
to be less than 12.

29
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,050
You know, you take the absolute
value of negative 6,

30
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,860
that's only 6 away from 0.

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,670
The absolute value of negative
11, only 11 away from 0.

32
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,520
So something that meets both
of these constraints will

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,630
satisfy the equation.

34
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,440
And actually, we've solved it,
because this is only a

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,810
one-step equation there.

36
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,670
But I think it lays a good
foundation for the next few

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,030
problems. And I could actually
write it like this.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,280
In interval notation, it would
be everything between negative

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,880
12 and positive 12, and not
including those numbers.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,690
Or we could write it like this,
x is less than 12, and

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,100
is greater than negative 12.

42
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,180
That's the solution
set right there.

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,420
Now let's do one that's a little
bit more complicated,

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,340
that allows us to think
a little bit harder.

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,480
So let's say we have the
absolute value of 7x is

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,260
greater than or equal to 21.

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,710
So let's not even think about
what's inside of the absolute

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,020
value sign right now.

49
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,180
In order for the absolute
value of anything to be

50
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,260
greater than or equal to
21, what does it mean?

51
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,040
It means that whatever's inside
of this absolute value

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,640
sign, whatever that is inside of
our absolute value sign, it

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,840
must be 21 or more
away from 0.

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,910
Let's draw our number line.

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,010
And you really should visualize
a number line when

56
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,970
you do this, and you'll never
get confused then.

57
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,660
You shouldn't be memorizing
any rules.

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,860
So let's draw 0 here.

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,980
Let's do positive 21, and let's
do a negative 21 here.

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,470
So we want all of the numbers,
so whatever this thing is,

61
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,400
that are greater than
or equal to 21.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,860
They're more than
21 away from 0.

63
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,920
Their absolute value
is more than 21.

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, all of these negative
numbers that are less than

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,090
negative 21, when you take their
absolute value, when you

66
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,750
get rid of the negative sign,
or when you find their

67
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,160
distance from 0, they're all
going to be greater than 21.

68
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,110
If you take the absolute value
of negative 30, it's going to

69
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,900
be greater than 21.

70
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,070
Likewise, up here, anything
greater than positive 21 will

71
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,440
also have an absolute value
greater than 21.

72
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,160
So what we could say is 7x needs
to be equal to one of

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,530
these numbers, or 7x needs to
be equal to one of these

74
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,930
numbers out here.

75
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,230
So we could write 7x needs to
be one of these numbers.

76
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,580
Well, what are these numbers?

77
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,810
These are all of the numbers
that are less than or equal to

78
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:20,070
negative 21, or 7x-- let me do a
different color here-- or 7x

79
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,160
has to be one of
these numbers.

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,290
And that means that 7x has to
be greater than or equal to

81
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,070
positive 21.

82
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,870
I really want you to
kind of internalize

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,460
what's going on here.

84
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,590
If our absolute value is greater
than or equal to 21,

85
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,480
that means that what's inside
the absolute value has to be

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,370
either just straight up greater
than the positive 21,

87
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,070
or less than negative 21.

88
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,170
Because if it's less than
negative 21, when you take its

89
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,110
absolute value, it's going to
be more than 21 away from 0.

90
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,090
Hopefully that make sense.

91
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,120
We'll do several of these
practice problems, so it

92
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,190
really gets ingrained
in your brain.

93
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,650
But once you have this set up,
and this just becomes a

94
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,960
compound inequality, divide both
sides of this equation by

95
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,130
7, you get x is less than
or equal to negative 3.

96
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,590
Or you divide both sides of
this by 7, you get x is

97
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,710
greater than or equal to 3.

98
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,520
So I want to be very clear.

99
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,920
This, what I drew here, was
not the solution set.

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,070
This is what 7x had
to be equal to.

101
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,470
I just wanted you to visualize
what it means to have the

102
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,460
absolute value be greater
than 21, to be more than

103
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,470
21 away from 0.

104
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,950
This is the solution set. x
has to be greater than or

105
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,570
equal to 3, or less than
or equal to negative 3.

106
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,370
So the actual solution set to
this equation-- let me draw a

107
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,870
number line-- let's say that's
0, that's 3, that is negative

108
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,365
3. x has to be either greater
than or equal to 3.

109
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,620
That's the equal sign.

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,000
Or less than or equal
to negative 3.

111
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,960
And we're done.

112
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,500
Let's do a couple
more of these.

113
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,520
Because they are, I think,
confusing, but if you really

114
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,490
start to get the gist of what
absolute value is saying, they

115
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,930
become, I think, intuitive.

116
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,840
So let's say that we have
the absolute value-- let

117
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,570
me get a good one.

118
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:32,310
Let's say the absolute value of
5x plus 3 is less than 7.

119
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,780
So that's telling us that
whatever's inside of our

120
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,030
absolute value sign has to be
less than 7 away from 0.

121
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,360
So the ways that we can be less
than 7 away from 0-- let

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,770
me draw a number line-- so the
ways that you can be less than

123
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,870
7 away from 0, you could be less
than 7, and greater than

124
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,740
negative 7.

125
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:54,910
Right?

126
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,970
You have to be in this range.

127
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,240
So in order to satisfy this
thing in this absolute value

128
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,590
sign, it has to be-- so the
thing in the absolute value

129
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,170
sign, which is 5x plus 3--
it has to be greater than

130
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:16,310
negative 7 and it has to be less
than 7, in order for its

131
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,060
absolute value to
be less than 7.

132
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,680
If this thing, this 5x plus 3,
evaluates anywhere over here,

133
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,810
its absolute value, its
distance from 0, will

134
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,420
be less than 7.

135
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,270
And then we can just
solve these.

136
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,810
You subtract 3 from
both sides.

137
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,160
5x is greater than
negative 10.

138
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,010
Divide both sides by 5. x is
greater than negative 2.

139
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,200
Now over here, subtract
3 from both sides.

140
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,960
5x is less than 4.

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,300
Divide both sides by 5, you
get x is less than 4/5.

142
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,560
And then we can draw
the solution set.

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,270
We have to be greater than
negative 2, not greater than

144
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,120
or equal to, and
less than 4/5.

145
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,230
So this might look like a
coordinate, but this is also

146
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,590
interval notation, if we're
saying all of the x's between

147
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,770
negative 2 and 4/5.

148
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,780
Or you could write it all of the
x's that are greater than

149
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,140
negative 2 and less than 4/5.

150
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,160
These are the x's that satisfy
this equation.

151
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,810
And I really want you
to internalize this

152
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,110
visualization here.

153
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,830
Now, you might already be seeing
a bit of a rule here.

154
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,110
And I don't want you to just
memorize it, but I'll give it

155
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,590
to you just in case
you want it.

156
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,809
If you have something like f of
x, the absolute value of f

157
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,409
of x is less than, let's
say, some number a.

158
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:41,730
Right?

159
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,600
So this was the situation.

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,810
We have some f of
x less than a.

161
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,080
That means that the absolute
value of f of x, or f of x has

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,600
to be less than a away from 0.

163
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,960
So that means that f of x has to
be less than positive a or

164
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,730
greater than negative a.

165
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,090
That translates to that, which
translates to f of x greater

166
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,460
than negative a and f
of x less than a.

167
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,280
But it comes from
the same logic.

168
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,540
This has to evaluate to
something that is less than a

169
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,380
away from 0.

170
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,280
Now, if we go to the other side,
if you have something of

171
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,810
the form f of x is
greater than a.

172
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,660
That means that this thing has
to evaluate to something that

173
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,730
is further than a away from 0.

174
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,330
So that means that f of x is
either just straight up

175
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,720
greater than positive a, or f of
x is less than negative a.

176
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,880
Right?

177
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,380
If it's less than negative a,
maybe it's negative a minus

178
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,980
another 1, or negative
5 plus negative a.

179
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,525
Then, when you take its
absolute value, it'll

180
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,730
become a plus 5.

181
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,490
So its absolute value is going
to be greater than a.

182
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,300
So I just want to-- you could
memorize this if you want, but

183
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,760
I really want you to think about
this is just saying, OK,

184
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,100
this has to evaluate, be less
than a away from 0, this has

185
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,440
to be more than a away from 0.

186
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,310
Let's do one more, because
I know this can be

187
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,780
a little bit confusing.

188
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,040
And I encourage you to watch
this video over and over and

189
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,490
over again, if it helps.

190
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,020
Let's say we have the absolute
value of 2x-- let me do

191
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,040
another one over here.

192
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,810
Let's do a harder one.

193
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,460
Let's say the absolute value
of 2x over 7 plus 9 is

194
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,460
greater than 5/7.

195
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,370
So this thing has to evaluate to
something that's more than

196
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,090
5/7 away from 0.

197
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,610
So this thing, 2x over 7 plus
9, it could just be straight

198
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,740
up greater than 5/7.

199
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,220
Or it could be less than
negative 5/7, because if it's

200
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,180
less than negative 5/7, its
absolute value is going to be

201
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,840
greater than 5/7.

202
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,970
Or 2x over 7 plus 9 will be
less than negative 5/7.

203
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,540
We're doing this case
right here.

204
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,290
And then we just solve both
of these equations.

205
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,750
See if we subtract-- let's just
multiply everything by 7,

206
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,290
just to get these denominators
out of the way.

207
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,730
So if you multiply both sides by
7, you get 2x plus 9 times

208
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,800
7 is 63, is greater than 5.

209
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,750
Let's do it over here, too.

210
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:32,630
You'll get 2x plus 63 is
less than negative 5.

211
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,010
Let's subtract 63 from both
sides of this equation, and

212
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,200
you get 2x-- let's see.

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,470
5 minus 63 is 58, 2x
is greater than 58.

214
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,230
If you subtract 63 from both
sides of this equation, you

215
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:59,040
get 2x is less than
negative 68.

216
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,345
Oh, I just realized I
made a mistake here.

217
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,090
You subtract 63 from both sides
of this, 5 minus 63 is

218
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,350
negative 58.

219
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,970
I don't want to make a careless
mistake there.

220
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,420
And then divide both
sides by 2.

221
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
You get, in this case, x is
greater than-- you don't have

222
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,910
to swap the inequality, because
we're dividing by a

223
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:22,440
positive number-- negative 58
over 2 is negative 29, or,

224
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,110
here, if you divide both sides
by 2, or, x is less than

225
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,520
negative 34.

226
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,180
68 divided by 2 is 34.

227
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,160
And so, on the number line,
the solution set to that

228
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,880
equation will look like this.

229
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,470
That's my number line.

230
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,460
I have negative 29.

231
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,890
I have negative 34.

232
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,380
So the solution is, I can either
be greater than 29, not

233
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,550
greater than or equal to, so
greater than 29, that is that

234
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:06,470
right there, or I could be
less than negative 34.

235
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,410
So any of those are going to
satisfy this absolute value

236
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,660
inequality.

1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,769
Does the Universe Have a Purpose? I'm not
sure.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,730
Anyone who expresses a more definitive response
to the question is claiming access to knowledge

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,550
not based on empirical foundations. This remarkably
persistent way of thinking, common to most

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:21,009
religions and some branches of philosophy,
has failed badly in past efforts to understand,

5
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:25,549
and thereby predict the operations of the
universe and our place within it.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,210
To assert that the universe has a purpose
implies a desired outcome. But who would do

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,070
the desiring? And what would a desired outcome
be? That carbon-based life is inevitable?

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,500
Or that sentient primates are life's neurological
pinnacle? Of course humans were not around

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,160
to ask these questions for 99.9999% of cosmic
history. So if the purpose of the universe

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,010
was to create humans then the cosmos was embarrassingly
inefficient about it.

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,290
And if a further purpose of the universe was
to create a fertile cradle for life, then

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,540
our cosmic environment has got an odd way
of showing it. Life on Earth, during more

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,330
than 3.5 billion years of existence, has been
persistently assaulted by natural sources

14
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:14,340
of mayhem, death, and destruction. Ecological
devastation exacted by volcanoes, climate

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,910
change, earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, and
especially killer asteroids have left extinct

16
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,799
99.9% of all species that have ever lived
here.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,820
How about human life itself? If you are religious,
you might declare that the purpose of life

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,810
is to serve God. But if youâ€™re one of the
100 billion bacteria living and working in

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,880
a single centimeter of your lower intestine,
you might instead say that the purpose of

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,760
human life is to provide you with a dark,
but idyllic, anaerobic habitat of fecal matter.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,920
So in the absence of human hubris, the universe
looks more and more random. Whenever events

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,050
that are purported to occur in our best interest
are as numerous as other events that would

23
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,689
just as soon kill us, then intent is hard,
if not impossible, to assert. So while I cannot

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,130
claim to know for sure whether or not the
universe has a purpose, the case against it

25
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,420
is strong, and visible to anyone who sees
the universe as it is rather than as they

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,340
wish it to be.

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,190
I was asked by The Templeton Foundation to
respond to a question: Does the Universe Have

29
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:19,749
a Purpose?

1
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:23,200
Save heritage, menahankan warisan

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,258
Its Wilayah Day and it is a day that we chose to conduct this city tour

3
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:36,720
this city tour is going to go through Jalan Sultan for us to advocate

4
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,680
a very important message that is to advocate the importance of

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,077
preservation of heritage and culture and history of a city

6
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:56,129
we all know that Kuala Lumpur is like any city in other part of the world,

7
00:00:56,529 --> 00:01:03,960
Kuala Lumpur has its own character, history and cultural background

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,898
we wanted the Malaysians especially and the world to understand

9
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:18,184
how Kuala Lumpur was established and came to today as a developed city

10
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:26,800
it is very important as part of the history of Malaysians to know that

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,679
the establishment and development of Kuala Lumpur is through the effort

12
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:37,961
put together by all the races, all races that stay in this country

13
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:44,440
It is a concerted effort of all races that upbring Kuala Lumpur until today,

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:58,828
Today MRT wishes to construct an underground tunnel, going to cost RM40 billion

15
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:06,121
through Jalan Sultan, to us this is very unwise.

16
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:11,781
It is unwise because the construction even though they use

17
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:19,226
the latest best methods available in the world it is not able to guarantee

18
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:28,598
the stability of the old buildings along Jalan Sultan and along Jalan Petaling.

19
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:36,434
We therefore have a strong desire to keep the development of Kuala Lumpur going on

20
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:45,329
at the same time maintain, keep the character of Kuala Lumpur city as it is.

21
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,178
We wish MRT to consider realignment.

22
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:58,638
Today we have to conduct this city tour because through the last four months

23
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:06,385
we have requested MRT to sit down with us to have a dialogue

24
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,932
to understand the peopleâ€™s voice

25
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:15,634
but four months effort have brought us to nowhere.

DARIA: I always had this dream of going aroundthe world and finding people that I connected

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,260
with both musically and personally. And, that�sbegun to happen.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,559
We discovered a globallive music venue.

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:16,839
RON: I wish everybody

5
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:21,419
could experience what I was experiencing.The further you step back, the more it hits

6
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,869
you that we're all interconnected.When I post a picture, people

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,359
contribute to it and it makes thewhole experience so much richer.FRANK: Domenic is

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,050
seven. He has Crohn�s Colitis disease.Google+ has definitely given me

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,390
a platform that I've never found anywhere else.

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,890
It isn�t just doctors that canmake a difference,

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,180
it�s you and me.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,030
SHINAE: When someone tells me thatsomething I posted

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,760
inspired them to cook something thatthey've never cooked before,

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,660
that makes me feel that whatI�m doing has purpose.

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,640
RICHARD BRANSON: I suspect it�s just -you�re just on the verge of this

16
00:00:54,640 --> 99:59:59,999
revolution of people to be able to have this voice,and communicate that voice.

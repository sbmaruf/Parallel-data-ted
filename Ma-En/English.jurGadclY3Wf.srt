Hey, welcome to Twitter

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,618
Let's quickly go over some basics

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:06,817
at the heart of Twitter there are

4
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,050
small bursts of information called Tweets

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,567
quick updates like a text message

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,467
but a Tweet can be more than just text

7
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:15,700
it can include a photo uploaded to Twitter

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,750
a video you can watch inside the Tweet

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,935
or a link to great content on the web

10
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:22,002
the stream of of Tweets is your Twitter

11
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,484
and you create it by following accounts

12
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:25,200
that are interesting to you

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,367
when you first join, your Twitter is empty

14
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:29,551
but during the signup we'll help you find great accounts

15
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,101
that match your interests.

16
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,218
Just pick categories you like such as

17
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:37,034
entertainment, news, sports, or enter your favorite hobby

18
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,950
and then we will show you some recommended accounts in those areas

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,352
when you click on the Follow button you'll start seeing

20
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,651
Tweets from that account on your Twitter

21
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,134
clicking on someone's name or picture

22
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:47,700
will tell you more about the account

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,116
It will also give you the option to follow or unfollow them

24
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,801
Following is not permanent, you can always

25
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,951
unfollow accounts that you're not that into

26
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:56,584
or search for accounts that you may have missed

27
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:58,451
after you're done signing up

28
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,450
It's important to know that you don't need to Tweet

29
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,818
to enjoy Twitter

30
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,701
many use it just to listen, rather than share

31
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,284
Once you finish your Twitter profile

32
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,735
by uploading a picture and completing your bio

33
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,204
consider downloading the app

34
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,352
to take Twitter with you on your smartphone

35
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,551
It's a great way to stay up to date with

36
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,967
everything you care about while you're on the go

37
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,051

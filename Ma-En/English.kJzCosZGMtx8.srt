1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,410
Let's review the Calvin
cycle a little bit.

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,410
Maybe I'm going to go into a
little bit more detail than

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,470
the last video.

5
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,110
And by doing that, we'll be
able to appreciate an

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,480
inefficiency, or what we think
is an inefficiency that occurs

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,640
in many photosynthetic plants.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,350
So just to review the Calvin
cycle, you start

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,500
off with some CO2.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,950
In the last video, I had six
molecules of CO2 and six

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,150
molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate.

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,590
But in this one, just to show
you that I could have

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,430
literally just divided that last
cycle by two, I'm going

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,210
to start with three and three.

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,640
Three molecules of
carbon dioxide.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,150
Three molecules of ribulose
bisphosphate.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,020
If you don't remember what
ribulose bisphosphate was, it

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,410
was just a 5-carbon molecule.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,090
It had two phosphates on it.

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,800
I can draw the phosphates.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,510
So you have a phosphate there.

22
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,070
And you have a phosphate
there.

23
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,680
And we saw on the last video--
and here I'm going to do a

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,420
little bit more detail.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,740
Of course carbon dioxide,
there's only one carbon.

26
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,319
I can just draw a carbon
like that.

27
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,300
I mean, I don't want to draw
the oxygens right now.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,520
I just want to focus on just
the carbons and maybe the

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,450
phosphates.

30
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,210
But in the last video we saw
that these two merged.

31
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,070
Or these two reacted.

32
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,950
They reacted in the presence
of ribulose bisphosphate

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,180
carbocylase, which
is this enzyme.

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,230
It was that big protein that I
showed you in the last video.

35
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,420
And it's called RuBisCo
for short.

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,390
So I'm going to write RuBisCo
in the middle

37
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,360
of this whole cycle.

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,690
Because all of this is going
on with the RuBisCo enzyme.

39
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,735
These molecules are joining on
to the RuBisCo enzyme and then

40
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,860
the ATP and the NADHs are
reacting on different parts.

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,810
And that's essentially what's
driving the whole reaction.

42
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,640
So you have all of this is
happening with that big

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,370
RuBisCo protein, or enzyme, or
whatever you want to call it.

44
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,380
And this just stands for
ribulose bisphosphate

45
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,740
carboxylate.

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,220
So it essentially telling you
that it merges a carbon onto

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,200
ribulose bisphosphate.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,450
And the last video, I just did
a very hand-wavey, I didn't

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,460
show you all of the
intermediates.

50
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,880
But I showed you, look, if in
this situation you end up

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,570
using six ATPs and six NADHs,
you'll end up with

52
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,580
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

53
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,440
Or G3P.

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,030
Or that's also called
phosphoglyceraldehyde so you

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,330
can also write it as PGAL.

56
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,790
But a very easy way to visualize
it as just a

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,930
3-carbon chain with
a phosphate.

58
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,930
With a phosphate group.

59
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,630
And the last video when I
started with six carbon

60
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,600
dioxides and six ribulose
bisphosphates.

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,070
And I ended up with
12 of these.

62
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,770
Now I have three and three.

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,320
Now I'm going to end up
with six of these.

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,810
So I'm going to end
up with six G3Ps.

65
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,110
And the math works out, right?

66
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,720
I have three carbons plus three
times five carbons.

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,100
That's a total of 18 carbons.

68
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,250
And here I have six times
three carbons.

69
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,700
Or 18 carbons.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,115
And that's what I showed you in
the last video, but there

71
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:08,120
are actually some intermediary
steps.

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,720
So the very first thing that's
actually formed is

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,970
3-phosphoglycerate.

74
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:20,630

75
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,190
And the whole reason why I'm
showing you this detail, and

76
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,380
maybe you're taking a biology
class where they actually go

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,400
into this level of details, is
I want to show that this

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,270
compound also gets produced in
that inefficient cycle that

79
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,970
we're going to explore
in this video.

80
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,210
So you get 3-phosphoglycerate,
which is

81
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,390
also a 3-carbon chain.

82
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,640
But it's a different
one than this.

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,530
And this isn't ready to produce
glucose just yet.

84
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,790
But you could also imagine that
as a 3-carbon chain with

85
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,360
a phosphate group.

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,260
And then, and course you're
going to produce six of these.

87
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,900
Just to make sure all the carbon
gets accounted for.

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,205
You have 18 carbons here, you
have 18 carbons here.

89
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,830
So you're going to
have six of these

90
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,580
3-phosphoglycerates get produced.

91
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,600
And then each of those gets
a phosphate from ATP.

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,990
So you're going to have
six ATPs come in.

93
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,460
Remember these ATPs got
produced in the light

94
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,470
dependent reactions that occur
in the membrane of our

95
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,130
thylakoids.

96
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,180
Anyway, we have these ATPs.

97
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,000
You have six ATPs.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,820
And then they become six ADPs.

99
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,780
So essentially they have given
away their phosphate groups.

100
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,040
So they're going to give one
phosphate group to each of

101
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,100
these six 3-phosphoglycerates.

102
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,870
And then you're going to end
up with this, right here.

103
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm running out of space.

104
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Maybe I didn't do it as neatly
as I should have.

105
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,240
But you're going to end up with
this three chain carbon,

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,580
or 3-carbon compound.

107
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,790
It's going to have two
phosphates then.

108
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,920
And this, you could
know the name.

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,170
This is 1 3-bisphosphoglycerate.

110
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,870

111
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,890
This was just
3-phosphoglycerate, which

112
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,220
means that the phosphate
is on the third carbon.

113
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,190
Now we have 1
3-bisphophoglycerate.

114
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,160
We have a phosphate on the
1-carbon and the 3-carbon.

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,020
We have two of them.

116
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,270
So it's bisphosphoglycerate.

117
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,080

118
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,050
So that's to get
us right there.

119
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,020
And then to get from the 1
3-biposphoglycerate, and of

120
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,110
course we have six
of these as well.

121
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,830
Six of these turn into
six of these.

122
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,430
And to turn these six 1
3-phosphoglycerate into our

123
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,690
three glyceraldehyde
3 phosphates, or

124
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,430
phosphoglyceraldehyde the
names are very daunting.

125
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,920
This is where we're actually
going to oxidize our NADPH.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,030
Remember oxidizing is losing
electrons or losing hydrogens

127
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,280
with their electrons,
either way.

128
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,170
So here, on this step right
here, two things are going to

129
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,560
happen, actually.

130
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:57,760
You're going to have six NADPHs
become six NAD pluses.

131
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,220
So they're losing that hydrogen
and the electrons.

132
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,450
And also one phosphate is going
to be lost from each of

133
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,930
these molecules.

134
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,290
And then you're going to
also have plus six of

135
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,140
the phosphate groups.

136
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,440
The phosphate groups don't
get lost here.

137
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,190
They get added onto these
molecules right there.

138
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,360
And then we end up with our
sixth glyceraldehyde

139
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,310
3-phosphates, which we learned
in the last video, we can then

140
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,720
use to produce fuel or
glucose or other

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,370
carbohydrates in the cell.

142
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,740
But we also learned that this
is called the Calvin cycle.

143
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,380
So all of it doesn't get used
to produce actual glucose or

144
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,850
other carbohydrates.

145
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:43,310
Most of it, out of the six, five
of them are going to be

146
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,190
used to produce our three
ribulose bisphosphates.

147
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,870
So let me do it like this.

148
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,440
So you're going to have five
G3Ps go in that direction.

149
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,030
So for every six G3Ps you
produce, five go back into the

150
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,670
cycle and then one
exits the cycle.

151
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,580
We saw this in the last video.

152
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,822
In the last video I had 12
here, so 10 went in this

153
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:06,420
direction and two in
this direction.

154
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm just dividing everything
by two in this video.

155
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,970
And the whole reason why I
multiplied by two in the last

156
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,360
video is so that we end up
with two going into this

157
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,170
direction because two
is enough to produce

158
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,310
at least one glucose.

159
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,270
But we don't have to have two.

160
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,260
We could just say we do this
whole cycle twice to get two.

161
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,760
But anyway, I have one
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

162
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,250
coming out of this end.

163
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,550
And then these five
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates

164
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,410
that stay in the cycle.

165
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,950
Remember those are
just 3-carbons

166
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,890
with a phosphate group.

167
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,560
I drew it over here already.

168
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,430
They will then use another
three ATP.

169
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:51,600

170
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,630
So we end up with three ADPs.

171
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,490
And the phosphate groups
actually end up on the

172
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,130
ribulose bisphosphate and they
get essentially recycled into

173
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,600
ribulose bisphosphate for the
whole cycle to happen again.

174
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
Remember when all this is
happening you can kind of

175
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,150
imagine in or on the surface
of this big enzyme.

176
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,400
This ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase.

177
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,980

178
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,940
And actually, just so you know
a piece of terminology, this

179
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,020
type of photosynthesis is called
C3 photosynthesis.

180
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:26,650

181
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,250
And the whole reason why it's
called C3 photosynthesis is

182
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,409
because the very first product
that you get when you react

183
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,840
with carbon dioxide, when the
first time you fix your carbon

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,850
dioxide-- remember carbon
dioxide fixation is when you

185
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,450
take it in its gaseous
form and you actually

186
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,600
put it into a molecule.

187
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,470
The very first carbon molecule
you get once the carbon

188
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,330
dioxide gets fixed is
a 3-carbon molecule.

189
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,020
It's phosphoglycerate.

190
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,170
That's why I showed
it to you there.

191
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,810
Because that's where
the three in the C3

192
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,920
photosynthesis comes from.

193
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,840
Now, everything I've just done
is a review of what we did in

194
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,740
the last video.

195
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,250
Maybe with a little
bit more detail.

196
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,470
And I showed you that you
don't have to start

197
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,250
with six and six.

198
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,960
You could start with three and
three and just have five go

199
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,630
down here and one go down
here instead of doubling

200
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,065
everything.

201
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:17,230
But what I want to show you now
is an inefficiency that

202
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,560
goes on in plants.

203
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,780
This RuBisCo doesn't
necessarily

204
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,640
just fix carbon dioxide.

205
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,300
It can also react with oxygen.

206
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,140
And actually, its name is
ribulose bisphosphate

207
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,570
carboxylase oxygenase, which
means it can react

208
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,030
with carbon or oxygen.

209
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,825
And this mechanism-- so let's
say you have your ribulose

210
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,740
bisphosphate hanging around.

211
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:50,380
You know we're in the stroma
of our chloroplast.

212
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,610
So let's say we have our five
ribulose bisphosphates.

213
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:03,070

214
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,810
And instead of reacting with
carbon it can actually react

215
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,350
with oxygen.

216
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,820
So instead of having carbon
dioxide here, I can have O2

217
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,180
coming in here.

218
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,940
We have oxygen coming in here.

219
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,560
And all of this, once again, is
occurring on the surface or

220
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,510
with the assistance
of the RuBisCo.

221
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,290
The exact same, the
RuBisCo enzyme.

222
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,540
Ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase.

223
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,710

224
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,210
That's why.

225
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,530
Because it can also
fix oxygen.

226
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,800
And when these two things react,
you don't get useful

227
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,810
things that can be used for
fuel and all of that.

228
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,930
You end up with-- and my drawing
is a little messy--

229
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,240
you end up with-- well when
these two guys react-- you'll

230
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,330
end up with five molecules
of this guy right here.

231
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,975
Five molecules of this

232
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:07,310
3-phosphoglycerate right there.

233
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,800
Remember here we ended
up with six of them.

234
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,380
But now we're only going
to end up with five

235
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,630
phosphoglycerates.

236
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:17,770

237
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,070
I know the names are
all very confusing.

238
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,550
But the basic idea is to
remember that what's happening

239
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,950
here is if carbon dioxide isn't
getting fixed, oxygen

240
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,630
can get fixed.

241
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,880
And you end up with five
phosphoglycerates.

242
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,380
And you actually also end up
with five-- this is called

243
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,630
phosphoglycolate.

244
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,400
I know these are very
daunting names.

245
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,300
Phosphoglycolate, which is
a 2-carbon molecule.

246
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,380
Which makes sense because we
only have five carbons to

247
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,350
start with.

248
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,650
This thing right here is
a 3-carbon molecule.

249
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,080
That's a 3-carbon molecule
and this right here

250
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,760
is a 2-carbon molecule.

251
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,010
So this right here is going to
be a 2-carbon molecule and it

252
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,880
has a phosphate group.

253
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,760
So as you can imagine, in this
situation we're not going to

254
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,710
be able to keep going forward
and produce our glyceraldehyde

255
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,100
3-phosphate, which we can then
use to make up carbohydrates.

256
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,950
We're stuck.

257
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,925
We just have these five
phosphoglycerates.

258
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:16,960

259
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,420
These can go on and some
percentage of them, but the

260
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,750
ratios are all getting
messed up.

261
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,690
But everything doesn't
necessarily happen this

262
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,760
cleanly in the cell.

263
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,600
These things can go on, but we
have one less being produced.

264
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,850
And this thing right here, it's
actually using up some of

265
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,750
our carbon from our ribulose
bisphosphate.

266
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,785
And if this thing kept going
up, all of our ribulose

267
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,910
bisphosphate is going
to get eaten up.

268
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,400
We're not going to be able to
continue on into this cycle

269
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,450
over and over again.

270
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,800
And actually this is kind
of a waste product.

271
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,700
Right here this is
a waste product.

272
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,410
Or we think it's a
waste product.

273
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,770
And this actually has to exit
your chloroplast and actually

274
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,770
get processed by other
organelles in the plant cells.

275
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,060
And these are called, these
waste processing organelles in

276
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,350
your cells, these are
peroxisomes I know there's a

277
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,060
lot of complicated
terminology here.

278
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,690
But the important thing to
remember, when RuBisCo fixes

279
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,200
oxygen, this is actually called
photorespiration.

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,220
That's an important
word to know.

281
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,470
Photorespiration.

282
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,860

283
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,670
All of a sudden, instead of
being able to carry forward

284
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,040
with your Calvin cycle and
produce a lot of sugar,

285
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,300
instead you are depleting
your RuBisCo.

286
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,060
So this is a very bad process.

287
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,000
This is going to get in the
way of your Calvin cycle.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,220
And remember how important
each of these G3Ps are.

289
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,500
Because for every turn of the
Calvin cycle, or at least the

290
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,640
way I did it, we only produce
one G3P that actually gets

291
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,220
used for something useful.

292
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,530
The other five G3Ps have to go
back to produce ribulose

293
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,480
bisphosphate.

294
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
RuBisCo of course
is the enzyme.

295
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,610
So in this situation we only
have five phosphoglycerates to

296
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,230
begin with.

297
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,650
Maybe if we have our ATP or an
NADH, we can convert these

298
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,770
five-- and it doesn't have to
go in this direction-- but

299
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,870
maybe we can convert these five
phosphoglycerates into

300
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,610
five glyceraldehyde
3-phosphates.

301
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,930
G3Ps.

302
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,300
Then all of these are going to
be used back to produce our

303
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,160
ribulose bisphosphate.

304
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,690
So to go from here to here,
we actually had to

305
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,160
use up ATP and NADH.

306
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,090
And then to go from here to
here, we have to use more ATP.

307
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,350
But we went through this whole
cycle and we didn't produce

308
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,820
anything, in terms of useful
things that can be used to--

309
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,050
essentially sugars or
carbohydrates that can be used

310
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,940
to fuel or provide structure
for the plant in any way.

311
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,490
So this is a completely--
or we think-- this

312
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,765
is a wasteful process.

313
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,990

314
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,040
So people wonder, when you
look a lot of biological

315
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,560
systems you don't see wasteful
processes all the time.

316
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,240
You would say, well wouldn't
natural selection have

317
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,480
selected against this?

318
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,490
And some people believe that
this is just a remnant from

319
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,510
our evolutionary past, or our
plants' evolutionary past,

320
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,860
where there wasn't a lot of
oxygen in the atmosphere.

321
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,040
And if there wasn't a lot of
oxygen in the atmosphere, this

322
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,030
was not that likely
of an occurrence.

323
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,630
But there's some people who
actually believe that no, this

324
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,770
might actually have
been selected

325
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,100
for in natural selection.

326
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,830
Because if there is a lot of
oxygen hanging around in the

327
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,710
cell, more than you need, that
oxygen might actually react

328
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,190
with your ATP and create other
harmful compounds in the cell.

329
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,030
And this might be a way of
sopping up the harmful oxygen

330
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,110
that's actually hanging
around the cell.

331
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,050
So who knows?

332
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,390
But it's interesting idea.

333
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,235
That you have this one enzyme
that can react with ribulose

334
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:56,210
bisphosphate and
carbon dioxide.

335
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,320
And if that happens, we just get
our regular Calvin cycle.

336
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,250
Or it can react with ribulose
bisphosphate and oxygen and

337
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,310
actually fix oxygen into
these two molecules.

338
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,610
Especially the phosphoglycolate
which we

339
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,130
think is a waste compound.

340
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,320
And if you just went on and on
in the Calvin cycle in this

341
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,460
way, you will not produce
any useful sugars.

342
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,960
So in the next video, what I
want to do is study some

343
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,310
plants that have been
able to get by this

344
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,850
photorespiration problem.

345
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,850
And you could imagine,
photorespiration could be a

346
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,200
really big deal or it could be
very harmful in situations

347
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,040
where, one, it's very important
for a plant to be

348
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,730
very productive of sugars.

349
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,890
And it can also, we'll see,
it can be a problem-- it's

350
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,550
definitely a problem if there's
a huge amount of

351
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,440
oxygen content.

352
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,890
But in the next video I'm going
to show you plants that

353
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,600
have gotten around this
problem by, instead of

354
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,030
performing C-3 photosynthesis,
which is the classic Calvin

355
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,320
cycle that I just showed
you, they perform C-4

356
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,130
photosynthesis.

357
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,840
And I'll show you what that
means in the next video.

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,554

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320


2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,970
We are told that the formula for
finding the perimeter of a

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,180
rectangle is P is equal to 2l
plus 2w, where P is the

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,520
perimeter, l is the length,
and w is the width.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,840
And just to visualize what
they're saying, and you might

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,080
already be familiar with this,
let me draw a rectangle.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
That looks like a rectangle.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,780
And if this side's length is l,
then this side's length is

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,230
also going to be l.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,140
And if this width is w, then
this width up here is w.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,690
And the perimeter is just how,
what is the distance if you

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,460
were to go around
this rectangle?

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,310
And so, that distance is going
to be this w plus this l, plus

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,350
this w-- or that width--
plus this length.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,070
And if you have 1 w and you add
it to another w, that's

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,320
going to give you 2 w's.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,940
So that's 2 w's.

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,700
And then if you have 1 l, and
then you have another l,

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,260
that's going to give you, if you
add them together, that's

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,970
going to give you 2 l's.

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,150
So the perimeter is going
to be 2 l's plus 2 w's.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,720
They just wrote it in a
different order than

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,300
the way I wrote it.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,650
But the same thing, so hopefully
that makes sense.

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,040
Now, their question is, rewrite
the formula so that it

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,630
solves for width.

27
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,050
So the formula, the way it's
written now, it says P is

28
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,120
equal to something.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,770
They want us to write it so
it's, this w, right here, they

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,410
want it to be w is equal to a
bunch of stuff with l's and

31
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,210
P's in it, and maybe
some numbers there.

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,240
So let's think about
how we can do this.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,260
So they tell us that P is
equal to 2 times l,

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,380
plus 2 times w.

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,300
We want to solve for w.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,750
Well, a good starting point
might be to get rid of the l

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,630
on this side of the equation.

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,790
And to get rid of it on that
side of the equation, we could

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,050
subtract the 2l from both
sides of the equation.

40
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,040
So let's do it this way.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,259
So you subtract 2l over here.

42
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,870
Minus 2l.

43
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,070
You're also going to have to do
that on the left-hand side.

44
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,400
So you're going to
have minus 2l.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,060
We're doing it on both sides
of the equation.

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,180
And remember, an equation says
P is equal to that, so if you

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,570
do anything to that, you
have to do it to P.

48
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,780
So if you subtract 2l from this,
you're going to have to

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,950
subtract 2l from P in order
for the equality

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,260
to keep being true.

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,450
So the left-hand side is going
to be P minus 2l, and then

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,250
that is going to be equal to--
well, 2l minus 2l, the whole

53
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,150
reason why we subtracted 2l is
because these are going to

54
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,280
cancel out.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,350
So these cancel out,
and you're just

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,870
left with a 2w here.

57
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,170
You're just left with a 2w.

58
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,260
We're almost there.

59
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,250
We've almost solved for w.

60
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,990
To finish it up, we just have
to divide both sides of this

61
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,350
equation by 2.

62
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,510
And the whole reason why I'm
dividing both sides of this

63
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,400
equation by 2 is to get rid of
this 2 coefficient, this 2

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,830
that's multiplying w.

65
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,770
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by 2, once

66
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,780
again, if you do something to
one side of the equation, you

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,260
do it to the other side.

68
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,330
The whole reason why I divided
the right-hand side by 2 is 2

69
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,120
times anything divided by 2
is just going to be that

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,240
anything, so this is
going to be a w.

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
And then we have our
left-hand side.

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,300
So we're done.

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:38,240
If we flip these two sides, we
have our w will be equal to

74
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,830
this thing over here-- equals
P minus 2l, all

75
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,700
of that over 2.

76
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,830
Now, this is the
correct answer.

77
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,990
There's other ways to
write it, though.

78
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,610
You might want to rewrite this,
so let me square this

79
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,840
off, because this is completely
the correct answer.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,590
This is the correct answer, but
there's other ways that

81
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,650
you might have been able to
get this answer, other

82
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,360
expressions for this answer.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,630
You might have also, you know,
another completely legitimate

84
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,720
way to do this problem-- let me
write it this way-- so our

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,779
original problem is P is equal
to 2l plus 2w-- is on this

86
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,960
right-hand side, what if
we factor out a 2?

87
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,010
So let me make this clear.

88
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,280
You have a 2 here, and
you have a 2 here.

89
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,090
So you could imagine
undistributing the 2.

90
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:41,650
So we would get P is equal
to 2 times l plus w.

91
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,680
This is an equally legitimate
way to do this problem.

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,780
Now, we can divide both sides of
this equation by 2, so that

93
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,710
we get rid of this 2 on
the right-hand side.

94
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,170
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by 2, these 2's

95
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,760
are going to cancel out-- 2
times anything divided by 2 is

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,220
just going to be the
anything-- is

97
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,440
equal to P over 2.

98
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,280
So let me just rewrite
this over here.

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,350
Let me just rewrite this.

100
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:18,310
So we will get P over 2 is going
to be equal to l plus w.

101
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,460
And then if we want to solve for
w, we just subtract l from

102
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,500
both sides.

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,320
And sometimes, you know, you
could write it in a separate

104
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,030
line like this.

105
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,840
Sometimes you could just
write it like this.

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,560
You could say, I'm going to
subtract an l on that side.

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,790
If I do it on that side,
I have to do it

108
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,830
on this side, too.

109
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,470
That's the same thing as
adding a negative l.

110
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,160
And so the right-hand side,
you're just left with a w.

111
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,570


112
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,230
And then the left-hand side,
you're going to have, it could

113
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,080
be a negative l plus P over 2,
or you could just change the

114
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:58,190
order, and you can write this
as P over 2 minus l.

115
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,650
And this is also an equally
legitimate answer.

116
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,750
And you're probably saying,
hey Sal, wait.

117
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,410
These things look different.

118
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,850
P minus 2l over 2, that
looks different than P

119
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,530
over 2 minus l.

120
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,880
And they're not.

121
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,580
Think about this.

122
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,780
We could rewrite this as P-- let
me do this with the same

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:26,690
colors-- this over here is the
same thing as P over 2

124
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,570
minus 2l over 2.

125
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,825
Right?

126
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,450
If I have a minus b and they're
both being divided by

127
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,360
2, I can just separate-- you can
imagine I'm distributing

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,850
the division by 2
right over here.

129
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,640
And over here, 2 times
l divided by 2,

130
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,040
that's just an l.

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:53,710
So this is going to be equal to
P over 2 minus l, which is

132
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,440
the exact same thing as
this right there.

133
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,666

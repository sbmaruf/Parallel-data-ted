1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,370

2
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,830
What I want to do
in this video is

3
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,030
give an overview
of quadrilaterals.

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,531
And you can imagine,
from this prefix,

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,780
or, I guess you could say,
the beginning of this word,

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,560
quad-- this involves
four of something.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,244
And quadrilaterals, as you
can imagine, are shapes.

8
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:17,660
And we're going to be talking
about two-dimensional shapes

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,260
that have four sides and four
vertices and four angles.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,701
So, for example--
one, two, three, four.

11
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,700
That is a quadrilateral,
although that last side

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,040
didn't look too straight.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,509
One, two, three, four.

14
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,950
That is a quadrilateral.

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,492
One, two, three, four.

16
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:36,700
These are all quadrilaterals.

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,400
They all have four
sides, four vertices,

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,820
and, clearly, four angles.

19
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,836
One angle, two angles, three
angles, and four angles.

20
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,960
Actually, let me draw this
one a little bit bigger,

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,370
because it's interesting.

22
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,440
So in this one
right over here, you

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,900
have one angle, two angles,
three angles, and then

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,440
you have this really big
angle right over there.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,800
If you look at the interior
angles of this quadrilateral.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Now, quadrilaterals,
as you can imagine,

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,680
can be subdivided
into other groups

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,970
based on the properties
of the quadrilaterals.

29
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,120
And the main subdivision
of quadrilaterals

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,540
is between concave and
convex quadrilaterals.

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,870
So you have concave,
and you have convex.

32
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,490
And the way I remember
concave quadrilaterals,

33
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,860
or really concave polygons
of any number of shapes,

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,490
is that it looks like
something has caved in.

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,900
So, for example, this is
a concave quadrilateral.

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,820
It looks like this
side has been caved in.

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,270
And one way to define
concave quadrilaterals--

38
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,410
so let me draw it a little bit
bigger, so this right over here

39
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,550
is a concave
quadrilateral-- is that it

40
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,400
has an interior angle that
is larger than 180 degrees.

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,230
So for example, this interior
angle right over here

42
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,070
is larger than 180 degrees.

43
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,480
And it's an interesting proof.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,396
Maybe I'll do a video.

45
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:01,450
It's actually a pretty
simple proof to show that,

46
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,170
if you have a concave
quadrilateral, if at least one

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,390
of the interior angles has
a measure larger than 180

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,510
degrees, that none of the sides
can be parallel to each other.

49
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,900
The other type of
quadrilateral, you can imagine,

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,690
is when all of the
interior angles

51
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,013
are less than 180 degrees.

52
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,263
And you might say, wait--
what happens at 180 degrees?

53
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:20,939
Well, if this angle
was 180 degrees,

54
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,730
then these wouldn't be
two different sides,

55
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,740
it would just be one side.

56
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,290
And that would look
like a triangle.

57
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,800
But if all of the
interior angles

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,670
are less than 180
degrees, then you're

59
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,820
dealing with a
convex quadrilateral.

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,890
So this convex
quadrilateral would

61
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,780
involve that one and
that one over there.

62
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,840
So this right over here is
what a convex quadrilateral

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,600
could look like-- four points,
four sides, four angles.

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,090
Now, within convex
quadrilaterals,

65
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,330
there are some other
interesting categorizations.

66
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,230
So now we're just going to
focus on convex quadrilaterals,

67
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,510
so that's going to be all
of this space over here.

68
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,200
So one type of convex
quadrilateral is a trapezoid.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
And a trapezoid is a
convex quadrilateral,

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,740
and sometimes the
definition here

71
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,400
is a little bit--
different people will

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,770
use different definitions.

73
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,480
So some people will
say a trapezoid

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,580
is a quadrilateral that
has exactly two sides that

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,850
are parallel to each other.

76
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,540
So, for example, they would
say that this right over here

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,350
is a trapezoid, where this
side is parallel to that side.

78
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,600
If I give it some letters here,
if I call this trapezoid ABCD,

79
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,750
we could say that segment AB
is parallel to segment DC,

80
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,349
and because of that we know
that this is a trapezoid.

81
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,390
Now I said that the
definition is a little fuzzy,

82
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,820
because some people say
you can have exactly one

83
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,070
pair of parallel
sides, but some people

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,590
say at least one pair
of parallel sides.

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,222
So if you use the
original definition--

86
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,680
and that's the kind of thing
that most people are referring

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,820
to when they say a
trapezoid, exactly

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,560
one pair of parallel sides-- It
might be something like this.

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,550
But if you use the broader
definition of at least one pair

90
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,380
of parallel sides,
then maybe this

91
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,320
could also be
considered a trapezoid

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,600
so you have one pair of
parallel sides like that

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,630
and then you have another pair
of parallel sides like that.

94
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,840
So this is a question mark
where it comes to a trapezoid.

95
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,740
A trapezoid is definitely
this thing here,

96
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,160
where you have exactly one
pair of parallel sides.

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,130
Depending on
people's definition,

98
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,916
this may or may
not be a trapezoid.

99
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,040
If you say it's exactly
one pair of parallel sides,

100
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,810
this is not a trapezoid,
because it has two pairs.

101
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,770
If you say at least one
pair of parallel sides,

102
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,930
then this is a trapezoid.

103
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,270
So I'll put that in a
little question mark there.

104
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,260
But there is a name
for this, regardless

105
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,560
of your definition of
what a trapezoid is.

106
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,990
If you have a quadrilateral with
two pairs of parallel sides,

107
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,300
you are then dealing
with a parallelogram.

108
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,430
So the one thing that you
definitely can call this

109
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,523
is a parallelogram.

110
00:04:56,523 --> 00:05:06,001

111
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,750
And I'll just draw it
a little bit bigger.

112
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,390
So it's a quadrilateral, and
if I have a quadrilateral,

113
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,850
and if I have two pairs
of parallel sides.

114
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,280
So the opposite
sides are parallel.

115
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,620
So that side is
parallel to that side,

116
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,930
and then this side is
parallel to that side

117
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,070
there-- you're dealing
with a parallelogram.

118
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,890
And then parallelograms can
be subdivided even further.

119
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,240

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,870
If the four angles
in a parallelogram

121
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,900
are all right angles, you're
dealing with a rectangle.

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,490
So let me draw one like that.

123
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,660

124
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,276
This is all in the
parallelogram universe,

125
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,650
what I'm drawing
right over here.

126
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,686
This is all the
parallelogram universe.

127
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:50,310
So it's a parallelogram,
which tells me

128
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,520
that opposite
sides are parallel.

129
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,640
And then if we know that all
four angles are 90 degrees.

130
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,180
And we've proven
in previous videos

131
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,180
how to figure out the sum of the
interior angles of any polygon.

132
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,679
And using that same
method you could

133
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:07,390
say that the sum of the interior
angles of any quadrilateral

134
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,130
is actually 360 degrees.

135
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,230
And you see that in this
special case as well.

136
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,240
But maybe we'll prove
it in a separate video.

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,810
But this right over here
we would call a rectangle.

138
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,920
Parallelogram--
opposite sides parallel

139
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,780
and we have four right angles.

140
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,520
Now, if we have a parallelogram
where we don't necessarily

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,070
have four right
angles, but where

142
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,800
we do have the length of
the sides being equal,

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,160
then we're dealing
with a rhombus.

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,100
So let me draw it like that.

145
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,990
So it's a parallelogram.

146
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,020
This is a parallelogram, so that
side is parallel to that side,

147
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,620
this side is parallel
to that side.

148
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,630
And we also know that all
four sides have equal length.

149
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,249
So this side's length is equal
to that side's length, which

150
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,790
is equal to that
side's length, which

151
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,650
is equal to that side's length.

152
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,390
Then we are dealing
with a rhombus.

153
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,190
So one way to view it-- all
rhombi are parallelograms.

154
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,260
All rectangles are
parallelograms.

155
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,220
All parallelograms you cannot
assume to be rectangles.

156
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,720
All parallelograms you
cannot assume to be rhombi.

157
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,350
Now, something can be both
a rectangle and a rhombus.

158
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,340
So let's say that this is
the universe of rectangles.

159
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,260
So the universe of
rectangles-- I'll

160
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,160
draw a little bit of
a Venn diagram here--

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,070
is that set of shapes and
the universe of rhombi

162
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,640
is this set of shapes
right over here.

163
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,050
So what would it look like?

164
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,880
Well, you would have
four right angles

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,330
and they would all
have the same length.

166
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,532
So it would look like this.

167
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,115
So it'd definitely
be a parallelogram.

168
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,750

169
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,710
Four right angles
and all the sides

170
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,860
would have the same length.

171
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,443
And this is probably the first
of the shapes that you learned,

172
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,670
or one of the first shapes.

173
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,450
This is clearly a square.

174
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,904
So all squares could also
be considered a rhombus,

175
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:55,820
and they could also be
considered a rectangle,

176
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,120
and they could also be
considered a parallelogram.

177
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,240
But clearly, not all
rectangles are squares,

178
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,530
and not all rhombi are squares.

179
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,900
And definitely not all
parallelograms are squares.

180
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,650
This one, clearly,
right over here,

181
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,000
is neither a rectangle nor
a rhombi, nor a square.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,940
So that's an overview.

183
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,882
Just gives you a little bit
of taxonomy of quadrilaterals.

184
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:17,340
And then in the
next few videos, we

185
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,300
can start to explore
them and find

186
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,270
their interesting
properties or just do

187
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,250
interesting problems
involving them.

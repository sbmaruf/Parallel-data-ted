1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,310
Tae Ik's phone is turned off..

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:10,221
Stylist Jang isn't picking up her phone..

3
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:12,257
Ah, seriously!

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:14,498
There are no traces of them entering the resort.

5
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:17,053
He even exchanged fists with the advertiser and then disappeared.

6
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:19,386
Then, where exactly did they go?

7
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,098
Please wait outside.

8
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:23,652
Yes.

9
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:27,622
If there is a rescue team at the resort, I would like to make a request.

10
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:30,406
What is the situation now? &lt;br&gt;Is the guest hurt?

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:34,066
Well.. someone is missing..

12
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:35,169
Oh, someone is missing?

13
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,339
Tae Ik!

14
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:39,748
Tae Ik!

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,720
Spread out and look for him. Spread out.

16
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:47,656
Hey! Spread out! Spread out!

17
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:51,734
I said spread out!

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,040
Tae Ik!

19
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,241
Go over there.

20
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,488
Tae Ik!

21
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:02,635
Tae Ik!

22
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,785
Tae Ik! Tae Ik!

23
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:14,936
Lee Tae Ik!

24
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,106
Lee Tae Ik!

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,430
Tae Ik!

26
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,236
Lee Tae Ik!

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,980
Tae Ik!

28
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:33,072
Hey, open the door.

29
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,303
Tae Ik!&lt;br&gt;Tae Ik!

30
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:46,994
Lee Tae Ik!&lt;br&gt;Tae Ik!

31
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,697
I told you it's locked..

32
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,043
Then where is he?

33
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:04,622
Ah! Shocks!

34
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,729
By the way, why am I here?

35
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,643
I definitely slept outside.

36
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:17,682
Hey! What did you do to the sleeping bag?

37
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:21,431
Do you sleep walk by any chance?

38
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:23,347
What? Sleep walk?

39
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:26,566
Yes. Did you do something while I was sleeping?

40
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,634
No.

41
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:31,241
Yesterday, I was definitely outside with the cat.

42
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:36,886
Huh? Cat!!

43
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,771
Don't open it!

44
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,831
What are you doing here, Stylist Jang?

45
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:50,638
That is..

46
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,767
I got shocked.

47
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,755
Tae Ik!&lt;br&gt;You..

48
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,481
That's not it.

49
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:10,432
I will take the others to the other side, &lt;br /&gt;so take care of things and come out.

50
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:12,651
Separately! All right?

51
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:15,137
So that people don’t catch on.

52
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,799
What are you doing?

53
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,928
Clean this.

54
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,864
By myself?

55
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,827
You have to help me fold this.

56
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:43,013
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Episode 5 &lt;br&gt;~Part 1~&lt;/b&gt;

57
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:49,558
&lt;i&gt;Subtitles brought to you by &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Maid of House 2 Team&lt;/b&gt; @Viki

58
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,910
&lt;i&gt;Something is weird... I'm sure I slept outside..

59
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:56,553
&lt;i&gt;Then.. that guy... by chance...

60
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,707
&lt;i&gt; He would never do that.

61
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:03,089
&lt;i&gt;Do I really sleep walk?

62
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:13,522
&lt;i&gt;Was she perhaps... pretending to sleep?

63
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:17,604
&lt;i&gt;Otherwise how could she be outside the sleeping bag?

64
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,342
&lt;i&gt; What is this dirty feeling?

65
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:42,515
&lt;i&gt; It's not.. right? It wouldn't be.

66
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:45,143
&lt;i&gt;Ehhy!

67
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:01,527
This one without a zipper hasn’t come in yet?

68
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,907
I asked for a call once it arrived.

69
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,599
Sir, someone else reserved it, so . . .

70
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:10,037
I did that.

71
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:13,832
Oh my!&lt;br&gt;Please, come this way.

72
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,069
Wow, what is this?

73
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:26,737
These are all my style! &lt;br&gt;This, too. This, too.

74
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:30,895
Buy all this? I can't... &lt;br&gt;Don't tempt me.

75
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,860
It's already been paid for.

76
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:35,112
By whom?

77
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:38,138
Here. &lt;br&gt;If you look here, you will know.

78
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,983
&lt;i&gt;JY Hotel&lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Suite 813&lt;i&gt;

79
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,559
-Hello?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Where are you?

80
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,859
Oh?&lt;br&gt;I'm outside.

81
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,836
&lt;i&gt;Are you going shopping again?

82
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:55,575
Am I addicted to shopping? &lt;br /&gt;I'm not always shopping!

83
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,328
Then hurry back.

84
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:00,815
Why? President told me to rest today!

85
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,306
Something came up.

86
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:05,559
I'll be back in Seoul in 1 hour. Come back by then.

87
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:09,774
I came to meet an important person. &lt;br /&gt;I may even sleep over.

88
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:12,635
The company atmosphere is really chilly today.

89
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:24,159
Hyung-nim! Why are you not talking to me?&lt;br&gt; Who are you going to meet?

90
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:26,781
Don’t try to pry into other’s personal live.

91
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:29,956
You don't even know who it is, so hang up!

92
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,808
It's me.

93
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,373
Relax, relax… after we go in.

94
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,689
Jackpot !

95
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,106
Why aren't you eating? You said you were hungry.

96
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,919
Just seeing my son makes me full.

97
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,056
Stop looking, my face will wear out.

98
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,929
You're not sick, right?

99
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,741
Of course, I am the completely healthy type.

100
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:31,882
What about your eye? Has it gone bad?

101
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:33,427
Let me look at it.

102
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,545
I'm really okay.

103
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,142
Mom, give me some coffee.

104
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,619
Come back with me..

105
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,728
and let's get an examination, huh?

106
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:46,864
I had it checked already. &lt;br /&gt;Everything is alright.

107
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,779
Really?

108
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:55,175
Son.. Can you stop your music career &lt;br /&gt;and come back with me?

109
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:58,959
I am really lonely without my son.

110
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:04,383
You are always with Chairman Won.&lt;br /&gt;How can you be lonely?

111
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,010
Do you think I like being next to a sick Chairman?

112
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,352
This is all for.. you..

113
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,650
Mom, stop.. Let's not talk about that..

114
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:17,968
How can I not? There really isn’t much time left for the Chairman now.

115
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:20,042
Ju Ming is trying to take your place.

116
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:21,797
I have to go now..

117
00:08:21,797 --> 00:08:23,717
I forgot I had practice today..

118
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:28,474
If you continue to act like this, I don’t know what I will do.

119
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,809
They are not just empty words.

120
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:37,508
For all the precious time I've spent caring for your old father,&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely stake your place.

121
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,220
Mom... you really...

122
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,120
make me sad. Coming after such a long time…

123
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,413
Kang Hwi, Mom…

124
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,207
I'm going . . .

125
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,295
Son..

126
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:06,997
Don't follow me... &lt;br /&gt;You know I don't like things like that, don't you?

127
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,369
I'll be going.

128
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:14,126
I'm not going to give up!

129
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,000
I think I caught something big.

130
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,377
Let’s go.

131
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,178
Why here?

132
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,585
Let’s go in first.

133
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:10,588
The President is waiting.

134
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,184
Stylist Jang,

135
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,638
what on earth happened yesterday?

136
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:25,418
Nothing happened.

137
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,671
We just lost our way.

138
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,492
No, not that.

139
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,159
At the shoot yesterday.

140
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,454
Ah!

141
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:34,072
That is… I got a little fired up.

142
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:36,091
No matter how much you got fired up,

143
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:40,285
I don’t understand why hyung hit the advertiser.

144
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:41,207
What?

145
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,459
Who hit who?

146
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:43,976
Tae Ik hyung.

147
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:48,472
Though he has a temper, he isn’t one to do something like that.

148
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,419
Ah! Seriously...

149
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,559
I heard that our Tae Ik behaved rudely to you, Department Director.

150
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,830
Really… that is… I am really sorry.

151
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:14,208
I came out of consideration for you.

152
00:11:14,203 --> 00:11:16,063
But what is this?

153
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,567
The individual isn’t even here.

154
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:27,166
Ah! Tae Ik, sit down

155
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:34,655
He does music, so there is a sensitive side to him.

156
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,849
Please accept a drink from me and magnanimously get over your anger.

157
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:40,382
That's all right. &lt;br /&gt;I will hear the apology directly from the person.

158
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,205
Ah! Of course, you should.

159
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:48,831
What are you doing? &lt;br&gt;Hurry and apologize.

160
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,588
Pour me a drink.

161
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,782
Let me receive a drink from a Hallyu star.

162
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:17,364
What is this?

163
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:30,774
Are you in your right mind?

164
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:35,212
There is a limit to how much you can sass.

165
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,748
You seem to still think you are still the son of a chaebol.

166
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:44,548
Don’t fool yourself!

167
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,279
You are but a singer and a commercial model.

168
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,821
And he is the advertiser who employed you.

169
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,780
Did the two of you plot together?

170
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:59,092
You both say the same thing.

171
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:00,875
What?

172
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,245
Is there only one commercial?

173
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:06,534
Will something happen to the company,&lt;br /&gt; if I don’t shoot that commercial?

174
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:11,922
Whether we shoot that commercial or not will be decided by me and not you.

175
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,425
You are merely my puppet! &lt;br&gt;Do you get it?

176
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:25,678
Then...

177
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,911
my master can take care of it.

178
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,410
And the puppet can leave.

179
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,950
Tae Ik. Tae Ik. Tae Ik!

180
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:48,127
Hey, Tae Ik. Why are you like this?

181
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,638
Let’s go in. Let’s go in and…

182
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:50,557
Move.

183
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,432
I said, move!

184
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:56,948
Because I can’t see straight right now.

185
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,050
Hey, alright! Alright! &lt;br&gt;Wait, I will get the car.

186
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,911
&lt;i&gt;This place, you see, was actually Tae Ik hyung’s house.

187
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:19,391
&lt;i&gt;All the way over to that hill completely belonged to Tae Ik’s family.&lt;/i&gt;

188
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:24,452
You were extremely rich, Lee Tae Ik.

189
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:31,032
&lt;i&gt; Hey! They were among the top builders.

190
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:34,637
&lt;i&gt;But… how did this happen?

191
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:42,383
&lt;i&gt; I also don’t know that well either. &lt;br&gt;Everyone keeps it quiet.

192
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,556
&lt;i&gt;Then, is only that house Tae Ik’s?

193
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,602
&lt;i&gt;All the money he earned so far was spent in buying that.

194
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:53,818
&lt;i&gt;Hyung wants to somehow retrieve this place completely.

195
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:57,435
&lt;i&gt;The piece of land is extremely large and also expensive…

196
00:14:57,437 --> 00:15:03,247
&lt;i&gt;The President bought it for investment, so he will not give it up easily.

197
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:33,277
Excuse me!

198
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,506
Excuse me!

199
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,572
I called you, but you won’t even answer.

200
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,161
Move.

201
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,760
Ah, seriously!

202
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,691
I didn’t even go home and waited all this time.

203
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,028
Here!

204
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:52,531
What is this?

205
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:54,351
It is an oriental medicine pain relief patch.

206
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:56,188
Stick it on your back where you got hurt yesterday.

207
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,311
I bought this specially, expensive one.

208
00:15:58,313 --> 00:16:00,433
It is hypoallergenic, so they said you can stick it anywhere.

209
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,530
Take it.

210
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,287
Only then can I also go home.

211
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:18,209
I’ll be going.

212
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,600
Wait!

213
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,613
Breathe.

214
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:53,946
I said let’s eat something at home... &lt;br /&gt;Do we have to go at this hour?

215
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,237
Is it still far?

216
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,890
We are going there?

217
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,117
Yes.

218
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,306
This place looks really expensive.

219
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:23,685
It is.

220
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:26,092
Hey. Let’s just go somewhere else. Huh?

221
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:29,493
Why? You said that you want to eat something delicious.

222
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,079
Everything is delicious for me…

223
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:34,168
Ah! There was a soft tofu store in front over there, let’s go there.

224
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,539
Unless it is organic tofu, I don’t eat it.

225
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
But... it is expensive, places like this.

226
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:45,727
If you don’t want to eat, go home alone.

227
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,541
Ah, seriously!

228
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,800
Please enjoy your food.

229
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,305
Is there anything else that you need?

230
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,400
No.

231
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,961
I don’t think we will be able to finish all of this either.

232
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,941
Do you have pine mushroom?

233
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:10,436
Ah, is the season over?

234
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,179
We have some that was brought in yesterday from Bonghwa.

235
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:14,512
An order for two is possible.

236
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,260
No! Just give us one serving. &lt;br /&gt;I don’t like mushrooms much.

237
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,842
Give 2 servings.

238
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:20,805
Yes.

239
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:23,444
Also please prepare pheasant Shabu-Shabu.

240
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:24,732
Yes.

241
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,553
How will we eat all of this that you keep ordering?

242
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,247
I will eat it, I will.

243
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,265
Aren’t you eating?

244
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,599
I will, I will eat, but still this is…

245
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:45,203
Natural abalone, Yeongdeok snow crab, tile fish from Jeju, rib patties made of Korean beef!

246
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:49,068
These are precious foods that you will never see set on the same table in your whole life.

247
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,196
What? Is there something lacking?

248
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:54,285
Ah! That’s not it.

249
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:59,163
Eat! Eat everything completely from here to there without leaving anything.

250
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,586
Ah, alright.

251
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,164
I will eat it and then die.

252
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,714
Kang Hwi

253
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,343
&lt;i&gt;Hi, Man Ok, it’s me.

254
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:15,406
Kang Hwi, wait a moment.

255
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,543
Man Ok, can you come to me now?

256
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:26,864
I want to see you.

257
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:28,452
I am eating now…

258
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,357
Just come, huh?

259
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,215
I will buy you something delicious, huh?

260
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:34,856
I was about to eat… I will go after I eat.

261
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:38,442
Ah! I don’t want to be alone.

262
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,725
Where are you now?

263
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,864
Near the company… The playground.

264
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:47,214
It is close to here… &lt;br /&gt;I will go there immediately after I eat.

265
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,691
Yes, alright.

266
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:51,072
I won’t budge and wait here.

267
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,033
You must come quickly, Man Ok!

268
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:53,611
Yes.

269
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:34,251
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi, Who do you like most in the world?

270
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:36,205
&lt;i&gt;Mom!

271
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,714
&lt;i&gt;Mom, likes you best too!

272
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:43,795
&lt;i&gt;If I have only you, there isn’t a thing that I am envious of in this whole world.

273
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,485
&lt;i&gt; Kang Hwi, what is it? What's the matter?

274
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,501
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi.

275
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:58,236
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi.&lt;br&gt;What should I do?

276
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:02,038
&lt;i&gt;What should I do? What should I do, Kang Hwi?

277
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,872
&lt;i&gt;- What to do? &lt;br&gt; - Mom!

278
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:10,152
&lt;i&gt; - Mom! &lt;br&gt; - Let go!

279
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:17,707
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi! Kang Hwi! Kang Hwi!

280
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:21,534
&lt;i&gt;Let go of me!&lt;br&gt; Let go of me!

281
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:24,014
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi!

282
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:26,208
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi!!

283
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:38,236
&lt;i&gt;What are you doing? During a meal! &lt;br&gt; Take him away!

284
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:20,651
I will never go back! Never again!

285
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,661
Please stop eating.

286
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:34,257
Your stomach will burst!

287
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:41,353
Ah, seriously! &lt;br&gt;Kang Hwi will be waiting…

288
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:44,555
I told you. We can’t go till we finish eating all of this!

289
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,298
Why are you being cranky for no reason?

290
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,463
Do you even know how much this is?

291
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:54,019
If you know how much this costs, you won’t be able to say that you will go, leaving food behind.

292
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:57,044
Ah! How much is it? &lt;br&gt;I will pay for it!

293
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,339
570,000 won?

294
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,153
Will you pay?

295
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:04,721
Uh-uh.

296
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:06,946
Then eat it, all of it.

297
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:23,041
&lt;i&gt; Why aren’t you coming?

298
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,423
&lt;i&gt;I have a problem.

299
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:33,791
&lt;i&gt;It's going to take a little time.&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry.

300
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,250
Hello, Sunbaenm.

301
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:04,159
What is it? Why are you here?

302
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:08,052
I came for a drink and I heard that you were here,

303
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:10,122
I came to say hello.

304
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,199
Why are you saying hello to me?

305
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,893
I will pour you a drink.

306
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:19,239
There isn't any.

307
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,086
Just a moment.

308
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,534
I will bring mine.

309
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:37,154
We don’t have to go this far.

310
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:41,046
We even have the video.

311
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,219
The more certain, the better.

312
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,410
Prepare it well.

313
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,347
You have to pay me well.

314
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:52,365
If I get the commercial.

315
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,909
Sunbae, you should have a drink.

316
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:28,797
I brought drinks.

317
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,685
I will pour you a drink.

318
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,938
Drink it up!

319
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:40,925
You have to poke it.

320
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,431
I won’t.

321
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:45,171
You definitely have indigestion.

322
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:48,401
If you poke it, it won’t even hurt and the food will go down, really!

323
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,768
I can't be sick from eating those expensive foods.

324
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:53,894
It’s just… my condition isn’t good.

325
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:57,135
You ate that much... it would be weird if you didn't have indigestion.

326
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:59,545
How can a man be so afraid?

327
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:01,404
Hurry and give me your arm!

328
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:04,954
Hey! Let go of me!&lt;br&gt;Are you really crazy?

329
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,773
Let go immediately!

330
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:09,961
See what happens if you poke! &lt;br&gt;I will not leave you alone if you really poke me!

331
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,218
Don't poke! &lt;br&gt;Ouch!

332
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:14,853
You have indigestion!

333
00:27:14,854 --> 00:27:17,344
Look Look! How dark it is!

334
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:21,971
Blood...

335
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,855
It will be better soon.

336
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:27,793
If it still doesn’t go down, we can poke your toes.

337
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:33,383
So scared..

338
00:27:33,378 --> 00:27:37,118
I'll bring some water. So, also take some medicine.

339
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,114
Here..

340
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:04,766
He fell asleep already?

341
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:10,841
Bye!

342
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:26,358
Don't tell me... &lt;br&gt; That he's still waiting there until now.

343
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:39,797
What did he say?

344
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:40,732
He's not answering.

345
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:42,464
No, Jong Chul!

346
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,169
This business is not such an easy venue.

347
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:46,663
Were you with a girl I don't know?

348
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,689
That's not it!

349
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:48,571
Yes, grandfather.

350
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,207
At one, shout!&lt;br&gt; At two, action!

351
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,893
Ay! &lt;br&gt; Two!

352
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,590
Oi!

353
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:58,086
The place that made me tjhe Jin Se Ryeong of today, &lt;br&gt;shouldn't that be my destination?

354
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,138
&lt;i&gt;shouldn't that be my next destination?

355
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,310
You refused to listen to me!

356
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:05,819
What are all these??

357
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:07,814
That's why I told you to be careful!

358
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:10,132
I told you there are always eyes everywhere.

359
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,843
Proceed immediately as planned.

00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,059
But it's not.

11
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,993
Should I tell you again?

12
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:38,997
You've had a tough life,and you will.

13
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:42,901
And you don't standa chance with this man.

14
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:46,172
I wish otherwise,but it's the truth.

Don't tell meit's written on my face.

It is.

17

But you never know.

18
00:01:53,978 --> 00:02:00,652
Then why try to find out?

19
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,288
I'll write you an amulet.

20
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:09,227
Look at your hair.When'd you wash it?

21
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:11,023
Have him carry this.

I can't guarantee anything.

00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:31,869
Don't you ever dance.

89
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:35,606
You almost blew it.

90
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:42,313
I dance along with youto make it seem real.

91
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,682
Are you performing?

92
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:48,886
Wear a sweat shirt.

93
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:54,425
There isn't any that fits me.

94
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:58,562
Sang-jun?

95
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,664
Why'd the stage collapse?

96
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:04,335
Sang-jun?

97
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:08,706

You okay?

100
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:15,446
They built the stage poorly.

101
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:21,118
I was worried sick.

102
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:29,827
Okay.

103
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:34,398
I need to assess the situation.

104
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:39,057
So he's interested in you?

105
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:45,409
It's the feeling.He's very nice to me.

106
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:46,979
Save it.

107
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:52,216
There are 3 types of womenfor men.

108

Don't eat the fat.

112
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:11,804
Listen.I have a woman's intuition.

113
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,072
It's your illusion.

114
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:17,142
Intuition is from experience.

115
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:22,513
Have you ever been in love?

116
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:24,782
- Tell me.- Have I been in love?

117
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:31,422
Yes, I have. My first love.

00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:35,793
Sweetie?

119
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:40,297
Did I ask you to buydiet pills from me?

120
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:43,767
What am I?

121
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:48,034
A guy who sells you diet pillscosting 3 grand?

122
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:50,241
Don't say that.

123
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:55,614
Your business is slow.I just wanted to help.

124
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,085
It is.And you're not helping.

125
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:05,389
You made me feelso miserable.

126
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,992
I'm sorry.

127
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:12,129
I'm warning you.Don't do it again.

128
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,998
Give pills to Jung-min.

129
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,268
You're as pretty as you are.

130
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:21,805
Try to lose weight,and we're through. Okay?

131
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:23,842
These are checks.

132
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:27,077
- Okay.- Endorse them.

133
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:30,881
Just do the first one.

134
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:35,185
If you do this again,we're done.

135
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,455
It was the last of him I saw.

136
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:42,394
I'm sorry. I don't deservea girl like you.

137
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:51,068
I'll pray for you to meetsomeone better than me. Amen.

138
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:55,606
That day,I decided not to eat.

139
00:12:55,606 --> 00:13:07,551
And to lose some weight.

140
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:08,953
Move.

141
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:12,556
This requires a skill.Grab that end.

142
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,692
Lift her at the count of 3.

143
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:21,865
One, two, three.

144
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:26,337
Lift her.

145
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,739
I said at the count of 3.

146
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,576
You lifted at 2. Hey!

147
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,042
Yes?

148
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,644
Lift at 3, okay?

149
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:35,547
We need to work together.

150
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:39,917
Grab it.At 3, okay?

151
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:45,489
One, two, three!

152
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,491
Bring that bed.

153
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,093
Put them together.

154
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:50,761
We'll roll her over.

155
00:13:50,761 --> 00:14:04,074
I'll do it.

156
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:08,479
Excuse me?

157
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:17,488
I'll roll over.

158
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,049
Why didn't you wake her?

159
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,592
I learned that night.

160
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:40,711
I'm not cut outfor love and diet.

161

Oh!

165
00:14:49,221 --> 00:15:20,284
Nicely done.

166
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,032
Are you hung over?

167
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:24,088
Give it some feelings.

168
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:27,791
God!

169
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,028
It's a vital part.

170
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:32,763
Try to feel the rhythm.

171
00:15:32,763 --> 00:16:12,736
It's taking forever.

172
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,272
She's trying hard?

173
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:17,142
Is trying hard enough?

174
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,031
Everyone does that.

175
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:22,846
Doing well is what counts.

176
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:29,119
Like you.

177
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,789
Keep up the good work.

178
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,892
- Chances are slim.- I believe in you.

179
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:42,499
Why does my hope get higher?

180
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,968
Thanks for the ride.

181
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,504
You're welcome.

182
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:50,507
Who are you visiting?

183
00:16:50,507 --> 00:17:02,052
Someone that I love.

184
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,288
Who's he?

185
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:18,168
Check me out.

186
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:19,703
Sorry! Bye.

187
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:26,076
Wait. I'm having abirthday party tomorrow.

188
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:38,222
Don't miss it.

189
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:43,694
I'm dancing with my dad.But he's dancing with my mom.

190
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:46,263
What do I mean?

191
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:51,501
Darling, how's Hanna?

192
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:56,373
I told you.She's become a singer.

193
00:17:56,373 --> 00:18:07,017
And she's in love.

194
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:15,492
Darling? Why do youget heavier by the day?

195
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:59,303
Let's keep on dancing.

196
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:02,205
A delivery for you.

197
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:10,547
"Hanna, I'm so gratefulfor your hard work."

198
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:15,218
"Wear this dressto my birthday party."

199
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,688
"HAN Sang-jun" HAN Sang-jun?

200
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:23,036
It's a dress?

201
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:35,105
What's this?A strap on the bus?

202
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:51,855
I'm not so sure.

203
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:52,991
Hi!

204
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,892
Hi.

205
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,795
Hanna, sit here.

206
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,998
Come on.Pass around drinks.

207
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:05,502
Excuse me.Excuse me. Sorry.

208
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:12,509
You could've come around.

209
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:13,977
Thanks.

210
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:19,016
Just come!

211
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:27,224
Thanks.

212
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:30,026
I got you something.

213
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:34,531
You shouldn't have.

214
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,667
Oh, I love this.

215
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,071
Thanks.

216
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:45,842
Take off your coat.It's so heavy.

217
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:50,515
Aren't you hot?Make yourself comfortable.

218
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,882
Yes.

219
00:20:51,882 --> 00:21:22,779
Go ahead.

220
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:29,219
You sent it.So I'm wearing it.

221
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,188
Yeah?

222
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,009
Yeah, Hanna.

223
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,592
Wear a dress likethat more often.

224
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:39,696
I'm totally fine with that.

225
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:48,305
Right?I love the design.

226
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,806
She's here.

227
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:53,977
Is she the Queen?You don't need to announce her.

228
00:21:53,977 --> 00:22:33,116
Let her in.

229
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:34,286
Where are you going?

230
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:40,157
I feel like dancing.

231
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:47,531
Let her through.

232
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,267
- Hold on.- What?

233
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,269
They're cleaning.Use the other restroom.

234
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:55,172
You're so funny.

235
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:57,274
How stupid can you get?

236
00:22:57,274 --> 00:23:00,744
I'd never know.

237
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:05,882
I wanna live with style.

238
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:09,753
But you're not helping.

239
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:13,049
That's a problem for me.

240
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,527
Miss backup dancer days?

241
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:24,801
The bitch gets on my nerves.

242
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:28,104
If so, you sing.

243
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:32,209
You think I like her?

244
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,045
You don't have to remind her

245
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,148
what a turnoff she is.

246
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:39,082
Leave her be.

247
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:42,452
Be grateful she's come to us.

248
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:47,857
I'll teach her a lesson.

249
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:51,828
Give me back the keysto the house and the car.

250
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:58,368
Then teach her a lesson.

251
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:04,341
Why are you crying?Why?

252
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,944
Hanna is the one to be crying.

253
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:11,615
She's talented,but ugly and fat.

254
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:14,452
You're untalented,but gorgeous and sexy.

255
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,653
You got it all going.

256
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:19,356
She exists for you.

257
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:24,194
Listen.We're just using her.

258
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:27,931
Understood?Be nice to her.

259
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:49,753
If she walks, it's over.

260
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:58,762
I couldn't be happierdreaming about you.

261
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:09,706
Even if it didn't last long...Thanks for making me happy.

262
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:19,749
Thank you so much.

263
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:23,053
My wife is showering again.

264
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:26,489
Why can't I die with style?

265
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:31,294
I'll make love to her,but it's gonna be hard.

266
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:33,498
I wanna hear your voice.

267
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,165
Aren't you there?

268
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:39,169
Pick up the phone.

269
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:47,031
What a story!Don't tell me you made it up.

270
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:50,058
Can you make it happen?

271
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:52,782
Your willpower can.

272
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:54,853
All I do is to remove a scar

273
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,587
from your hurt soul.

274
00:25:57,587 --> 00:26:02,926
How much will it cost?

275
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:06,093
I'm a doctor,not a businessman.

276
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:09,399
Is it expensive?

277
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:15,034
All the things you want donewith 30% discount...

278
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:19,743
I'll pay you every pennywith interest.

279
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:22,746
Can I do it on credit?

280
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:24,649
- Ms. KIM?- Yes?

281
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:29,152
Will you show this lady out?

282
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:33,089
Don't validate parking.

283
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,894
Jesus protects meHow blessed I am

284
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:41,765
Don't you recognize my voice?

285
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:46,669
Shall we goto the injection room?

286
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:49,773
And tear up stockings?

287
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:51,541
Right.

288
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:57,018
Did you make love last nightafter she showered?

289
00:26:57,018 --> 00:26:59,015
Who did the eye jobon that patient yesterday?

290
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:02,287
It was horrible.

291
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,923
And what's up with mealsfor patients?

292
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,091
They complained to me.

293
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:14,764
Get out! Leave!

294
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:18,101
Who are you?

295
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:22,739
I know you're a good person.

296
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:26,376
You've given your wifea full body makeover.

297
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:30,048
Now you dreadlaying your hands on her.

298
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,917
You must know how I feel.

299
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:38,221
I've done crazy thingsduring phone sex.

300
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,458
You say they don't respectplastic surgeons.

301
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,096
That's because they don'tdeal with lives.

302
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:46,529
I'm doing thisso I can live a life.

303
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:51,067
Not to satisfy my vanity.

304
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:56,673
It's the right causeyou've been looking for. Right?

305
00:27:56,673 --> 00:28:00,109
Did you memorize all that?

306
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:06,716
You could die from all these.

307
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:24,834
I died yesterday.

308
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,903
Go ahead.

309
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:37,046
I knew you'd do thatso I made a copy.

310
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,616
You'll put it on the net?

311
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:48,625
You can't blackmail me!

312
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:52,095
My life is in your hands.

313
00:28:52,095 --> 00:29:02,939
You can end it.Or save it.

314
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:13,116
- Yes?- Get me my operation schedule.

315
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:14,817
These eyes.

316
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,819
What about a nose?

317
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:19,155
Okay, this.Without a mole.

318
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:21,225
Pick the face shape

319
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:24,127
from these actresses.Which one?

320
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:30,008
Kate Moss!

321
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:34,072
Meet a skinny, pretty master

322
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,441
and live happily. Okay?

323
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:53,756
Love... I love you!

324
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:59,395
Here we go.Count backwards from ten.

325
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:03,735
Ten, eleven, twelve...

326
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,535
Backwards!

327
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:18,481
Nine, eight, seven...

328
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:23,419
Ammy's 2nd album postponed

329
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:49,145
You call yourself an agent?Don't take it out on me!

330
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,149
How can you do this to me?

331
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:59,656
Call me now,or I'll report you missing.

332
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:02,325
Years of suffering is over.

333
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:07,033
Make peace with yourselfand enjoy freedom.

334
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:16,339
What was once you...It's gone forever.

335
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:18,141
We'll redo the nose.

336
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:24,013
You bought me thissaying that I'd be as pretty.

337
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:27,784
Remember?

338
00:31:27,784 --> 00:32:30,078
I'll be pretty soon.

339
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:35,251
That...

340
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:38,054
That's me?

341
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:42,258
Sir, it's flawless.

342
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:57,044
That's the only flaw.It's too natural.

343
00:32:57,044 --> 00:33:06,282
I even cry prettily.

344
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:41,083
Hey! Take it easy.Your jawbone will drop.

345
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:50,927
- Hi.- Hi.

346
00:33:50,927 --> 00:34:49,318

352
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:33,396
Line up, please.

353
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:36,999
What a surprise to see youat a signing event.

354
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:41,027
I love your sitcom.Rating is 5%?

355
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:42,673
That's hard to achieve.

356
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,174
5%!

357
00:35:45,174 --> 00:35:49,578
Give me those songsyou're not using.

358
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:53,416
For Pink.

359
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:59,188
Bye. Smile, dude.

360
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:00,069
Miss?

361
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:14,057
That's for your eyes.

362
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:16,572
I don't wanna do the sitcom.

363
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:20,176
It cost me a fortuneto get you in it.

364
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:30,152
Get in the car.

365
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:46,869
Sure.

366
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,004
Sir?

367
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,541
Are you okay?

368
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:57,046
God, it must hurt.

369
00:36:57,046 --> 00:37:00,483
What a waste!

370
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,619
Were you delivering? Or...

371
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,039
You got a cut here.

372
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,093
What am I doing?I'm sorry.

373
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:15,164
Dude, are you okay?

374
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:55,304
- Are you okay?- Yes.

375
00:37:55,304 --> 00:38:00,743
An automatic transmissionwith full options.

376
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:03,579
You're into speed?

377
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:07,065
What?

378
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:10,254
How much is this?

379
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,455
I wouldn't recommend it.

380
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:17,093
It has a lot of miles on it,

381
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:20,162
and the brakes are bad.

382
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:22,865
No air conditioning?

383
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,935
What do you expectfor 5 grand?

384
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:32,108
It's pretty bad.Who would buy this?

385
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:34,011
- I'm sorry.- It's okay.

386
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,813
It's okay. It's okay.

387
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:41,752
This can bea good practice car...

388
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:46,522
...for novice drivers.

389
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:49,093
Check out something else.

390
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,066
I'd be happyto get rid of this junk.

391
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:55,998
But my consciencewon't allow me.

392
00:38:55,998 --> 00:38:59,235
Bye.

393
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:01,037
Come on.

394
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:08,021
You know what?You're gorgeous.

395
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:12,548
Don't mind me saying this.

396
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:23,759
You're beautiful.

397
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,895
I made the right decision.

398
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:30,633
I needed a car.

399
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:38,107
The seatbelt?

400
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:44,947
It's only 5 grand.No problem.

401
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:48,184
"You're gorgeous."

402
00:39:48,184 --> 00:40:00,129
"You're beautiful."

403
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,132
It's a bad business day.

404
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:05,134
And you've added insultto injury.

405
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:07,536
Get out of the car.

406
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,538
Get out!

407
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:12,741
I'll bill youfor a year's treatment.

408
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:16,513
I can't believethis is happening.

409
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:17,982
See what she's done?

410
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,682
Damn!

411
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:21,852
What'd you honk for?

412
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,287
Get the hell up, asshole.

413
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,121
What?

414
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,055
Fucking lunatic.

415
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,224
No name calling, asshole!

416
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:32,361
Bring it on, fuckface!

417
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:34,296
Yeah, run!

418
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:39,668
What a moron!

419
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:42,806
Can you believe this?

420
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:46,008
She has no conscience.

421
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:47,276
Damn!

422
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,213
Sir...

423
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:53,015
If you can't drive, don't!

424
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:56,092
The road is so wide.Why crash into me?

425
00:40:56,092 --> 00:41:01,223
I live from hand to mouth,and you ruined...

426
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:03,158
- You okay?- What?

427
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:07,896
You look familiar.Ever been in my taxi?

428
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:15,838
You're blocking the traffic!

429
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,021
Direct the traffic.Move it.

430
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:22,211
We have an accident here.

431
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,315
You okay?

432
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,249
Yes.

433
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,183
Not hurt?

434
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:30,653
No, I'm totally fine.

435
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:31,555
God!

436
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,657
Hey, you're bleeding.

437
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,066
Are you okay?

438
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:38,046
Absolutely.

439
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:39,363
But...

440
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:44,133
It doesn't hurt.This is embarrassing.

441
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,636
I'm really okay.

442
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,071
The damage to your car is bad.

443
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,873
Know any garage?I know a good one.

444
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,608
What's your cell number?

445
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:55,377
What?

446
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:57,413
I saw the whole thing.

447
00:41:57,413 --> 00:41:58,982
You cut in front of her.

448
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:03,319
Didn't I?What was I thinking?

449
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:04,987
Check her license.

450
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:06,523
She might not have one.

451
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,624
Are you a cop?

452
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:11,427
Check her license!

453
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:13,929
Can I see it?

454
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:28,644
Here.

455
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:30,646
There's nothing to worry.

456
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:35,317
If your friend confirms your ID,we'll let you go.

457
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:37,619
I knew she didn't havea license.

458
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,057
How convenient.Plastic surgery?

459
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:46,023
Which hospital is it?I should get it done, too.

460
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:50,699
Ma'am?Her friend is coming.

461
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,136
We don't need her, do we?

462
00:42:52,136 --> 00:43:16,125
Right.

463
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:20,896
Hanna?

464
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:22,631
Hanna?

465
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,767
Pork.

466
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:31,206
I want some... Pork.

467
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:33,031
Why didn't you feed her?

468
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:35,412
We sure did!

469
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:40,749
You should've fed her3 portions at a meal.

470
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:45,032
Let's get out of hereand eat some pork.

471
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:51,427
God, you've lostso much weight.

472
00:43:51,427 --> 00:44:00,969
When'd you get a perm?

473
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:05,541
Jung-min?

474
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:16,852
Do I know you?

475
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:23,025
Hanna?

476
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:28,073
You...

477
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:30,165
It's really you!

478
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:32,201
What?

479
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:37,239
The silicon might slipout of place.

480
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,576
Look at you!

481
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:42,644
What? Go where?

482
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:43,847
I shouldn't?

483
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,281
They'll recognize you.

484
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:50,385
You disappeared a year ago.

485
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:54,289
They've been lookingall over for you.

486
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:57,259
You ruined Ammy's 2nd album.

487
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:00,429
They're looking hardfor your replacement.

488
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:02,931
I can be the replacement.

489
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:07,135
They'll like mesince I have the same voice.

490
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:08,105
No?

491
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,007
If they find out, you're done.

492
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:14,051
You didn't recognize meuntil I told you.

493
00:45:14,051 --> 00:45:16,378
No way!

494
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:25,954
I hate myselfI know I'm fool

495
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:38,001
But, I can't stop loving youIt hurts me

496
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:42,704
You're hurting my ears.See you later.

497
00:45:42,704 --> 00:45:45,607
I'm just so nervous.

498
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:47,578
Give me another shot.

499
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,677
Get out!

500
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:52,214
Okay.

501
00:45:52,214 --> 00:46:00,455
Excuse me? Here.

502
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:02,324
A Korean-American?

503
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:06,528
Yes.

504
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:15,007
Send her in.

505
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:20,676
Jenny?

506
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:24,379
It says hereyou're fluent in Korean.

507
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:25,814
A little bit.

508
00:46:25,814 --> 00:46:34,056
Lose those shades.

509
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:47,269
Face us, will you?

510
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:59,314
Hit it.

511
00:46:59,314 --> 00:47:05,053
# The wind knocks on the window

512
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:12,127
# Over the room as small as me

513
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:22,537
# Twinkling stars so beautifulFilling the room with love

514
00:47:22,537 --> 00:47:26,677
# Don't be hurt

515
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:34,217
# Caressing my wound gently

516
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:42,691
# Embracing me to sleep

517
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:50,899
# Too hurt for my legs to walk

518
00:47:50,899 --> 00:47:56,471
# Eyes so blurry with tears

519
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:05,916
# Before loveNever meant for me

520
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,251
# I will keep on smiling

521
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,887
She's a slugger.

522
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:21,329
Look at her, man.She's far from a slut.

523
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:28,136
# Like those starsembroidered in my eyes

524
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:46,621
# I will love you forever

525
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:51,927
I think it's over.

526
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:53,196
Wait outside, please.

527
00:48:53,196 --> 00:49:02,771
Okay.

528
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:06,308
We're good now!

529
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:10,078
We're good!

530
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:13,749
Sang-jun, congratulations.

531
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:16,785
Putting out my album now?

532
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:19,002
Leave us alone.

533
00:49:19,002 --> 00:49:20,455
Leave.

534
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:27,229
Ammy, let's go.

535
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:32,367
Look.

536
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:34,004
Can't you see who she is?

537
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:45,814
Huh?

538
00:49:45,814 --> 00:49:50,485
You know me, don't you?

539
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:57,959
I think I know you.

540
00:49:57,959 --> 00:50:01,463
You can tell?

541
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:03,066
You can, can't you?

542
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,134
Of course I can.

543
00:50:06,134 --> 00:50:09,404
Why can't you be honest?

544
00:50:09,404 --> 00:50:12,741
Thought you could fool me?

545
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:16,179
I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

546
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,615
Listen. I just...

547
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:23,185
You're no different.Why lie to me?

548
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:26,059
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

549
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:31,096
The department store,the used car market...

550
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:35,564
You followed me?

551
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:38,433
Thought I wouldn't know?

552
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,735
You told her I'm the bestproducer in the business?

553
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:42,604
Yes, I am.

554
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:45,242
Why couldn't you face me...

555
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:50,912
...and tell meyou wanna be a singer?

556
00:50:50,912 --> 00:50:56,551
Yes, I do.I want to be a singer.

557
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:57,454
Right?

558
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:02,791
Yes, she'll be awesome.A top singer.

559
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:06,628
Let's go!

560
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,631
What's wrong with you?

561
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:12,968
Bye.

562
00:51:12,968 --> 00:51:18,707
She's a dog.

563
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:22,477
Why the tears?

564
00:51:22,477 --> 00:51:26,948
Look what you did.You made her cry.

565
00:51:26,948 --> 00:51:33,021
By the way...Let's get your face fixed up.

566
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:36,693
Slit your eyes biggerand get your nosed raised.

567
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,795
No! No way.

568
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:43,131
You know what?

569
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:46,801
I'm too scared to gounder a knife.

570
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:53,174
Plastic surgery?I would never do it.

571
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:59,014
It's for those who lackconfidence in themselves.

572
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:00,025
What?

573
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:04,586
Wait.

574
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:09,659
Are you telling meI'm not pretty enough?

575
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,429
No, I'm not.

576
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,997
A natural beauty?I love it!

577
00:52:15,997 --> 00:52:19,536
Good for building your image.

578
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,303
Right, Sang-jun?

579
00:52:21,303 --> 00:52:27,842
So you're all natural?

580
00:52:27,842 --> 00:52:35,317
I surely am.

581
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:36,718
Let's sign a contract.

582
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:39,022
Take a good look at her.

583
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,523
Think about it, Dad.

584
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:44,227
Jenny has a qualitythat you can't find...

585
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,897
...in any other girls today.

586
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:50,165
What's so special about her?

587
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:52,534
She looks a bit awkward.

588
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:55,017
Personally, I prefer Ammy.

589
00:52:55,017 --> 00:52:59,024
An image of innocence.A natural beauty.

590
00:52:59,024 --> 00:53:02,677
It's what money can't buy.

591
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:05,513
Right. That's what it is.

592
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:08,045
You're sleeping her,aren't you?

593
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:11,686
She's not a tramp.

594
00:53:11,686 --> 00:53:16,726
She has a special qualitythat money can't buy.

595
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:20,128
Can't you see that?

596
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:22,013
You're a hound dog.

597
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:29,004
Look who's talking.

598
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:34,642
Dad?

599
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:35,545
Come on!

600
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,914
We don't need his help.Let's just do it.

601
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:42,385
Don't disappoint me.

602
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,419
It'll speed up things.

603
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:47,057
I can't kiss his ass anymore.

604
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,191
Come on!

605
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,724
What?

606
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:52,862
This isn't so like you.

607
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,996
What's your good quality?

608
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:56,232
Perseverance!

609
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,099
Why trashing it now?

610
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:04,739
I'm counting on you. Big brother.You trust me, don't you?

611
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:09,377
Don't call me that.I'm only 13 months older.

612
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:13,615
Let's do this, okay?

613
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:15,183
God damn it!

614
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:19,287
You're bad!

615
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:27,062
Dad, please... Dad!

616
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:28,043
Okay, that's it.

617
00:54:28,043 --> 00:54:32,235
Just like that.That's good.

618
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:49,057
Good! Okay!

619
00:54:49,057 --> 00:54:52,239
Ammy!

620
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,744
Drag it out at the end.

621
00:54:56,744 --> 00:55:14,128
They'll go crazy.

622
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:16,043
Pee...

623
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:22,104
Pee... Pee is coming.

624
00:55:22,104 --> 00:55:26,673
Excuse me? Nurse!

625
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:28,575
What's new isn't always good.

626
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:33,015
That's not it.

627
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:36,318
You're making me sickof what I had before.

628
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:38,487
You want me to walk?

629
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:40,089
You'll be sorry.

630
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:41,824
I never look for a dogthat's run.

631
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:44,358
I always find my dog,no matter what.

632
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:46,036
Watch me. I'll find Hanna.

633
00:55:46,036 --> 00:55:51,498
Don't bring Hanna up!

634
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:57,771
Stop talking about her.

635
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,173
More coming.

636
00:55:59,173 --> 00:56:02,044
If she was worriedabout her father...

637
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:05,145
...she would've showed uplong ago.

638
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:07,516
You're wasting your time.

639
00:56:07,516 --> 00:56:10,884
Focus on the sitcom.Memorize your lines.

640
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:12,154
I'm a singer.

641
00:56:12,154 --> 00:56:16,323
You realized that now?

642
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:19,827
Hello?

643
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:23,053
I'm a singer. A singer!

644
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:24,967
I want to be a singer!

645
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:27,668
A singer!

646
00:56:27,668 --> 00:56:33,034
God is the only onewho can do everything.

647
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:45,886
We humans dowhat we're capable of.

648
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:47,556
Jung-min, look at him.

649
00:56:47,556 --> 00:56:53,026
He's been waving at me.

650
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:54,296
What took you so long?

651
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:58,732
I've been admiring you.

652
00:56:58,732 --> 00:57:00,467
What are we doing today?

653
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:04,004
We're making you happy.

654
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:11,812
How does that sound?

655
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:19,853
That's right.I'm THE Jenny.

656
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:24,057
Put suntan oil on me.

657
00:57:24,057 --> 00:57:30,631
Why should I?

658
00:57:30,631 --> 00:57:33,167
You have nice boobs.

659
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:36,077
Of course.You know how much...

660
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:40,707
I love them so much.

661
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,071
They're natural, right?

662
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:46,446
You're a natural beauty,aren't you?

663
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:53,453
Of course!It's done so naturally.

664
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:56,156
I'm natural.

665
00:57:56,156 --> 00:58:05,899
Turn around.Come on. Good.

666
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:11,672
Hey, you're so fair-skinned.You're from California, right?

667
00:58:11,672 --> 00:58:13,307
Yes.

668
00:58:13,307 --> 00:58:17,611
Did you live in the basement?

669
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:20,414
You look like a bean curd.

670
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:30,457
So tacky. Never got a tanning?Never been to a tanning saloon?

671
00:58:30,457 --> 00:58:37,764
So? You covered your breastsfor 3 hours?

672
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:44,738
You thought they'd popinside the tanning machine?

673
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:48,008
That's a load of bullshit.

674
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:50,512
She got a boob job, too.

675
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:52,779
You're talking about oneon that sitcom, right?

676
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,917
She has bags of saline solutionfor boobs.

677
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:59,721
They hurt when touched.

678
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:02,224
And they don't feel goodto touch.

679
00:59:02,224 --> 00:59:07,062
That's whyI put silicone bags in you.

680
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:11,733
Right?Not because they're cheaper.

681
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:16,536
Right? Please, tell me.

682
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:21,108
I'm sad. So sad.

683
00:59:21,108 --> 00:59:25,746
Do you know what it is?

684
00:59:25,746 --> 00:59:30,118
It's lack of confidence.Didn't I tell you?

685
00:59:30,118 --> 00:59:31,486
Unless you act confidently,

686
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,288
you can't win his heart.

687
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:41,795
Beauty is attitude, okay?

688
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:46,033
This is an engine.

689
00:59:46,033 --> 01:00:02,716
No way I'm doing that.

690
01:00:02,716 --> 01:00:06,053
# Here we go again

691
01:00:06,053 --> 01:00:08,989
# Make it hot, Baby

692
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:14,828
# Oh. Don't be afraid

693
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:17,597
# High in the sky

694
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:20,967
# The sun shines the way

695
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:28,108
# Oh. Don't you stop, Baby

696
01:00:28,108 --> 01:00:32,245
# Maria...

697
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:38,485
Let's call it a day.

698
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:40,187
What do you say?

699
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:46,426
The video quality is good.

700
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:48,628
What cam did you use?

701
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:57,037
Not that.What do you feel from her song?

702
01:00:57,037 --> 01:01:00,741
Her song carries her heart...

703
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:07,315
...for someone that she loves.I think. No?

704
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:09,783
Can't you sing like her?

705
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:15,856
You care too muchabout how you look.

706
01:01:15,856 --> 01:01:21,862
Come on, she's ugly.

707
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:25,005
You must've been embarrassedseen with her.

708
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:30,203
Stop it!

709
01:01:30,203 --> 01:01:34,241
She was special to me.

710
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:43,817
You're here, thanks to her.

711
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:44,092
Still...

712
01:01:44,092 --> 01:01:49,289
You're no half of her.

713
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:54,694
Why are you crying?

714
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:58,799
Are you nuts?

715
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,302
So you'll confess to him?

716
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:05,272
After all this?

717
01:02:05,272 --> 01:02:07,843
You've committed a fraud.

718
01:02:07,843 --> 01:02:11,077
So I should do itbefore it's too late.

719
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:14,481
He'll understand.

720
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:19,052
Remember 3 types of womenI told you about?

721
01:02:19,052 --> 01:02:21,069
I'm a pretty one now.

722
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:25,525
No, it doesn't apply.

723
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:27,394
You know why?

724
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:36,336
Those with plastic surgeryaren't women. But monsters.

725
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:50,045
Jung-min...

726
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:53,987
What are you,an expert in relationships?

727
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:58,291
You sound like you havetons of experience.

728
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:02,731
More than you.At least, my love isn't one-way.

729
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:08,735
Oh, you're in a crazy love?

730
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:12,138
With whom? This guy?

731
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:15,075
Is he in love with you, too?

732
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:17,344
Or trying to sell you stuff?

733
01:03:17,344 --> 01:03:18,098
You ransacked my bag?

734
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:27,854
You didn't empty the pocketsafter wearing my clothes.

735
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:33,096
Whatever it is...Don't buy anything from him.

736
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:35,564
I'm not like you.

737
01:03:35,564 --> 01:03:42,302
I know. Like I did.No, like the old Hanna.

738
01:03:42,302 --> 01:03:47,342
Don't do everything his waylike a fool.

739
01:03:47,342 --> 01:03:51,545
At the end of the day, you getthe same thing. "We're too different."

740
01:03:51,545 --> 01:03:59,152
He'll never sayyou're ugly and fat.

741
01:03:59,152 --> 01:04:04,491
Like the old saying,nothing beats experience.

742
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:12,699
Confess to him.

743
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:14,334
What are you doing here?

744
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:23,043
That video...Should we study it more?

745
01:04:23,043 --> 01:04:31,551
Come in.

746
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:36,923
Mr. CHOI once told me.

747
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:41,294
Do many Korean girlsdo plastic surgery?

748
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,497
I'm just asking.

749
01:04:44,497 --> 01:05:04,005
What do you think about it?

750
01:05:04,005 --> 01:05:07,921
Didn't you tell meyou didn't understand?

751
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:11,024
What are you doing?

752
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:14,396
You said it was for thosewho lack confidence.

753
01:05:14,396 --> 01:05:17,864
I think the same.Stop it.

754
01:05:17,864 --> 01:05:19,666
Come here.

755
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:33,747
Sorry. Let's go.

756
01:05:33,747 --> 01:05:35,749
We're doing the concert.

757
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:41,521
It's been a while.

758
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:45,825
Love!

759
01:05:45,825 --> 01:05:50,098
How'd you end up here?What happened?

760
01:05:50,098 --> 01:05:58,972
I'm sorry.It's my bad. Love!

761
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:02,509
You feed her raw fish?

762
01:06:02,509 --> 01:06:10,417
Why am I yawning?She loves raw fish.

763
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:17,557
Anyway, we're on the same pageabout plastic surgery.

764
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:23,083
Go away.Then again...

765
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:27,767
Desire to become prettyisn't a bad thing.

766
01:06:27,767 --> 01:06:32,238
Men who are only afterpretty women are bad.

767
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:40,647
And these days...Okay, okay. And these days...

768
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:44,284
Hey. Bang!

769
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:50,069
And it's like cosmetics today.

770
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:55,962
Why do they hide it then?They hate revealing it.

771
01:06:55,962 --> 01:07:00,333
It's a lame self-justification.

772
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,901
Can't you see?

773
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:07,073
That's why you stand outin this business.

774
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:16,916
This is fresh.Eat some.

775
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:20,086
About plastic surgery...

776
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:24,491
I've thought about it.

777
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:32,732
I think I can understand.

778
01:07:32,732 --> 01:07:38,071
Only if it's not my girl.

779
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:43,943
I absolutely hate it.

780
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:51,985
But I understand.

781
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,082
Let's go.

782
01:07:53,082 --> 01:07:57,019
Go, Natural beauty!

783
01:07:57,019 --> 01:08:04,043
Goodnight.

784
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:08,268
Jenny!

785
01:08:08,268 --> 01:08:11,137
Out of the way!

786
01:08:11,137 --> 01:08:13,239
Hi.

787
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:20,058
What's wrong?

788
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:25,084
You shot a film here.

789
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:31,191
How long has it been?

790
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:34,016
Who put you up to this?

791
01:08:34,016 --> 01:08:39,199
Put it out.

792
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:43,336
Nobody did.I just like her so much.

793
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:47,375
Aren't you that delivery man?

794
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:54,214
That's right.You remember me.

795
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:58,184
I understand, but...

796
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:59,187
Why laughing?

797
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:03,189
It tickles.

798
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:06,094
If this gets out,it's the violation of publicity.

799
01:09:06,094 --> 01:09:09,429
I like her so much, and...

800
01:09:09,429 --> 01:09:11,499
You like her so much...

801
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:15,134
...but didn't carehow she feels being watched?

802
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:18,339
Documenting her private lifeis a crime.

803
01:09:18,339 --> 01:09:24,577
No, it was for myself.

804
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,088
Stop laughing.

805
01:09:26,088 --> 01:09:30,383
This is what stalkers do.

806
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:36,356
Aren't you ashamedof yourself?

807
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:38,725
Wait.Don't be too harsh.

808
01:09:38,725 --> 01:09:43,429
Give him a break.He did it out of liking me.

809
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,733
What's the big deal?

810
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:50,238
What's a person to dowhen all they can do is...

811
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,338
...watch from afar?

812
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:55,608
Do you have any ideawhat it feels like...

813
01:09:55,608 --> 01:10:00,481
...not being able to confessone's love?

814
01:10:00,481 --> 01:10:02,649
Excuse me.

815
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:08,988
How do you know so wellhow I feel?

816
01:10:08,988 --> 01:10:30,071
This is whatyou had to say, right?

817
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:33,813
Daddy...

818
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:34,615
Ammy!

819
01:10:34,615 --> 01:10:46,359
Let go of me. Let go.

820
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:48,528
Becoming someone new?

821
01:10:48,528 --> 01:10:51,965
You have to forget yourself.

822
01:10:51,965 --> 01:11:21,728
Your past, memories...Erase them all.

823
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:27,009
I even sweat pretty.

824
01:11:27,009 --> 01:11:32,872
Maria.

825
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:41,814
Ave maria, a~ maria~ mari

826
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:45,818
Practicing at the saunawill help.

827
01:11:45,818 --> 01:11:51,924
Tell me.Do you have to sing?

828
01:11:51,924 --> 01:11:57,023
Of course! Singers sing.You kidding me?

829
01:11:57,023 --> 01:12:00,004
No. All I'm saying is...

830
01:12:00,004 --> 01:12:02,835
Do what you can.

831
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:09,042
You'd be God if you dideverything you want.

832
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:11,344
What?

833
01:12:11,344 --> 01:12:13,913
It's what my dad says.

834
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:19,085
God is the only onewho can do everything.

835
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:36,235
We humans dowhat we're capable of.

836
01:12:36,235 --> 01:12:43,091
You're a phony

837
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:54,554
Is this van a phony?

838
01:12:54,554 --> 01:13:01,694
Jenny, it's your phone.

839
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:06,099
Hello? What?Jung-min did?

840
01:13:06,099 --> 01:13:08,002
To a hospital? Why?

841
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:10,503
Jung-min tried to kill herself.

842
01:13:10,503 --> 01:13:13,873
It's your first TV show.You can't screw it up.

843
01:13:13,873 --> 01:13:19,745
My friend is more important!

844
01:13:19,745 --> 01:13:23,349
We were quiet worried.

845
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:25,718
But we found nothingin her stomach.

846
01:13:25,718 --> 01:13:28,287
It'd been digested.

847
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:33,259
30 sleeping pills can belethal for others.

848
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:37,096
So she's in a coma?

849
01:13:37,096 --> 01:13:39,532
She's just sleeping.

850
01:13:39,532 --> 01:13:42,301
Like a bear hibernating.

851
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:47,673
It can't be explained medically.She was lucky.

852
01:13:47,673 --> 01:14:02,155
30 sleeping pills couldkill an elephant.

853
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:03,856
What's this?

854
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:08,494
She bought this?

855
01:14:08,494 --> 01:14:12,965
A home sauna?

856
01:14:12,965 --> 01:14:14,267
Jenny?

857
01:14:14,267 --> 01:14:15,736
I've been calling you, Babe.

858
01:14:15,736 --> 01:14:18,037
What's going on?

859
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:22,241
Think of what you wantfor lunch.

860
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:27,613
Hey, Su-jin.How are you?

861
01:14:27,613 --> 01:14:30,716
Su-jung! I meant Su-jung.

862
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,053
Wanna go swimming?

863
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,423
Excuse me.

864
01:14:37,423 --> 01:14:47,567
I'll call you back.

865
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:54,073
Did you dump herbecause you loved her?

866
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:57,545
Why so fast?

867
01:14:57,545 --> 01:15:01,148
You should've waited to seewhat a home sauna can do.

868
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:05,151
Did you tell hernot to go on a diet?

869
01:15:05,151 --> 01:15:11,039
"I'll be upset if you lose weight."You told her so?

870
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:18,013
Why didn't you be a manand tell her the truth?

871
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:22,435
That you hate her being fat.And you were desperate...

872
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:28,207
...to sell your products.

873
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:32,211
If you loved her...

874
01:15:32,211 --> 01:15:39,819
Why'd you have to dump her?

875
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:41,355
You bastard!

876
01:15:41,355 --> 01:15:44,025
Wait! What's wrong?

877
01:15:44,025 --> 01:15:49,163
You don't know?Is it a crime to be ugly?

878
01:15:49,163 --> 01:15:53,567
We're not charity cases.I have so much to say, but...

879
01:15:53,567 --> 01:15:55,403
Wait! Who are you?

880
01:15:55,403 --> 01:16:06,545
Damn!

881
01:16:06,545 --> 01:16:07,915
What's going on?

882
01:16:07,915 --> 01:16:08,983
Who's this?

883
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:09,884
Who are you?

884
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:13,986
Oh, you're in this together.

885
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,323
Calm down!

886
01:16:15,323 --> 01:16:19,493
Hey! You two are dead.

887
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,095
Stay right here.

888
01:16:21,095 --> 01:16:23,729
I'll call the cops.

889
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:26,065
You okay?

890
01:16:26,065 --> 01:16:45,718
My nose...

891
01:16:45,718 --> 01:16:54,493
Call the cops.Or take this and shut up.

892
01:16:54,493 --> 01:16:56,397
What'd I tell you?

893
01:16:56,397 --> 01:16:57,732
That miniskirt isan invitation to a rapist.

894
01:16:57,732 --> 01:17:01,002
Look what happened.

895
01:17:01,002 --> 01:17:14,088
Sorry. What if I was late?Let's go.

896
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,215
Get her dress!

897
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:19,418
She's here.1 minute to go. Standby.

898
01:17:19,418 --> 01:17:20,755
What happened?

899
01:17:20,755 --> 01:17:41,841
How much time?

900
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:45,413
Look who's here.Isn't this Sang-jun?

901
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:48,816
What's that?Is that her concept?

902
01:17:48,816 --> 01:17:52,062
Sang-jun, this conceptdoesn't appeal to me.

903
01:17:52,062 --> 01:18:06,265
Hurry!

904
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:14,106
Don't worry.They'll love your voice.

905
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:18,811
This is it.

906
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:23,416
Show them what you got.

907
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:26,352
We can't lose to them.

908
01:18:26,352 --> 01:18:29,955
Right.

909
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,525
Can you do it?

910
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:39,665
Okay. I believe in you.No matter what...

911
01:18:39,665 --> 01:18:43,536
Get a room!Get out there!

912
01:18:43,536 --> 01:18:50,943
Okay, Jenny.

913
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:58,451
They're not a couple.Trust me.

914
01:18:58,451 --> 01:19:00,986
Here is Jenny!

915
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:19,672
"Maria"

916
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:22,942
# Here we go again

917
01:19:22,942 --> 01:19:25,811
# Make it hot, Baby

918
01:19:25,811 --> 01:19:31,684
# Oh, don't be afraid

919
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:37,079
# High in the skyThe sun shines the way

920
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:45,097
# Oh, don't you stop, Baby

921
01:19:45,097 --> 01:19:51,036
# Maria Ave maria

922
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:56,976
# Fly and catch those clouds

923
01:19:56,976 --> 01:20:02,982
# Maria Ave maria

924
01:20:02,982 --> 01:20:07,887
# Strong against violent waves

925
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,188
She's pretty good.

926
01:20:09,188 --> 01:20:13,826
# Maria Ave maria

927
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:15,362
She's good.

928
01:20:15,362 --> 01:20:21,033
# Fly and catch those clouds

929
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:27,139
# Maria Ave maria

930
01:20:27,139 --> 01:20:30,844
# Strong against violent waves

931
01:20:30,844 --> 01:20:34,446
What's her concept?

932
01:20:34,446 --> 01:20:39,385
It's singing.

933
01:20:39,385 --> 01:20:43,188
What's yours?

934
01:20:43,188 --> 01:20:48,127
Strawberry milk?

935
01:20:48,127 --> 01:20:54,199
# Maria Ave maria

936
01:20:54,199 --> 01:21:00,105
# Flay and catch those clouds

937
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:06,178
# Maria Ave maria

938
01:21:06,178 --> 01:21:12,117
# Strong against the violent waves

939
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:23,262
# Maria~

940
01:21:23,262 --> 01:21:34,139
This sauna thing is okay.

941
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:37,543
You're a phony

942
01:21:37,543 --> 01:21:44,618
Thanks to a new model,the sales have...

943
01:21:44,618 --> 01:21:49,588
Skyrocketed! Dad?

944
01:21:49,588 --> 01:22:04,837
Spit out the gum.

945
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,405
"Jenny"

946
01:22:06,405 --> 01:22:50,983
"New star comes up!"

947
01:22:50,983 --> 01:23:26,952
I'm drunk.God, this is awkward.

948
01:23:26,952 --> 01:23:34,593
He'll know they're fakeif he touches them.

949
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:49,108
Not there.

950
01:23:49,108 --> 01:24:32,918
Not there, either.

951
01:24:32,918 --> 01:24:36,421
Should I sing for you?

952
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:58,051
You wanna work now?

953
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,379
This way.

954
01:24:59,379 --> 01:25:00,147
What?

955
01:25:00,147 --> 01:25:01,068
Come on.

956
01:25:01,068 --> 01:25:06,518
Jenny?

957
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:12,124
Answer it.Answer it, will you?

958
01:25:12,124 --> 01:25:14,194
I know it all.

959
01:25:14,194 --> 01:25:19,464
You even watch porn.

960
01:25:19,464 --> 01:25:21,101
What are we doing?

961
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:23,135
What type do you want?

962
01:25:23,135 --> 01:25:26,171
A nurse, a high school girl,a secretary?

963
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:29,341
What? A nurse?

964
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:35,581
Okay, it's a favorite pick.A nurse it is.

965
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:44,823
Jenny, open the door.This isn't it.

966
01:25:44,823 --> 01:25:48,462
Just try to relax.It'll help.

967
01:25:48,462 --> 01:25:53,632
What should I do with it?

968
01:25:53,632 --> 01:25:54,867
Should I rip it?

969
01:25:54,867 --> 01:26:18,257
See? There you go.You can wear it over your head.

970
01:26:18,257 --> 01:28:02,828
Hakuna Matata. The African symbolhas granted me my wish.

971
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:06,698
Do many Korean girlsdo plastic surgery?

972
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:22,514
Do you know how it feelshiding your love?

973
01:28:22,514 --> 01:28:25,152
You wrote this song?

974
01:28:25,152 --> 01:28:27,486
Yes.

975
01:28:27,486 --> 01:28:33,492
When you were writing it...What came across your mind?

976
01:28:33,492 --> 01:28:43,402
I just wrote itlooking at the stars.

977
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:47,305
What are you doing?

978
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:57,215
Watching porn again?

979
01:28:57,215 --> 01:29:05,724
About last night...It never happened, okay?

980
01:29:05,724 --> 01:29:06,827
Last night...

981
01:29:06,827 --> 01:29:23,408
Leave, will you?Let me finish watching porn.

982
01:29:23,408 --> 01:29:52,938
Jenny's Album Launching Party

983
01:29:52,938 --> 01:30:03,415
Pull that up. If Sang-jun sees it,he'll be upset. Hello?

984
01:30:03,415 --> 01:30:11,123
Damn, she's almost naked.I'll be back.

985
01:30:11,123 --> 01:30:17,896
Hey. Hey! Congrats!Your fan is here.

986
01:30:17,896 --> 01:30:21,666
Someone dying to see you.

987
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:32,711
I can't hear you.What?

988
01:30:32,711 --> 01:30:37,315
I brought this for you.

989
01:30:37,315 --> 01:30:45,069
- Here.- What are you doing?

990
01:30:45,069 --> 01:30:53,665
What are you doing?

991
01:30:53,665 --> 01:31:15,032
Take it.

992
01:31:15,032 --> 01:31:19,057
You know him?

993
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:32,704
Just... A fan of mine, I hear.

994
01:31:32,704 --> 01:31:36,374
Who brought him?

995
01:31:36,374 --> 01:31:41,079
Did you?

996
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:52,791
Take him back home.

997
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:57,764
He's your fan.Why didn't you take the doll?

998
01:31:57,764 --> 01:31:58,531
Jung-min...

999
01:31:58,531 --> 01:32:18,025
Let's go.

1000
01:32:18,025 --> 01:32:21,987
Still here?

1001
01:32:21,987 --> 01:32:28,046
Go to bed earlyfor the concert tomorrow.

1002
01:32:28,046 --> 01:32:34,566
I know that old man.

1003
01:32:34,566 --> 01:32:39,804
I know.He's your fan.

1004
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:45,543
No. I mean he is...

1005
01:32:45,543 --> 01:32:54,152
Stop it. KANG Hanna.

1006
01:32:54,152 --> 01:33:00,258
What'd you just call me?

1007
01:33:00,258 --> 01:33:05,096
Don't worry.Nobody else knows.

1008
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:11,002
I didn't, either.

1009
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:18,091
When'd you find out?

1010
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:21,098
Is that important?

1011
01:33:21,098 --> 01:33:25,417
You're Jenny now.

1012
01:33:25,417 --> 01:33:29,688
And it's Jenny'sfirst concert tomorrow.

1013
01:33:29,688 --> 01:33:40,065
How... You knewhe was my dad?

1014
01:33:40,065 --> 01:33:50,675
I gave both Hannaand Jenny a chance.

1015
01:33:50,675 --> 01:33:57,349
It's scary.So I'm only a product.

1016
01:33:57,349 --> 01:33:59,951
Hanna is worthless,

1017
01:33:59,951 --> 01:34:04,522
but Jenny is worth a fortune.Is that it?

1018
01:34:04,522 --> 01:34:07,225
Because of you...

1019
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:16,301
That I've been deceiving you...It's been so hard.

1020
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:21,473
Now I see I was a big fool.

1021
01:34:21,473 --> 01:34:26,044
Why'd you take my dog?

1022
01:34:26,044 --> 01:34:27,814
As a hostage?

1023
01:34:27,814 --> 01:34:29,781
That's enough.

1024
01:34:29,781 --> 01:34:34,486
You find me repulsivewith plastic surgery?

1025
01:34:34,486 --> 01:34:38,156
I said enough! Stop it.

1026
01:34:38,156 --> 01:34:41,459
So you avoided me.

1027
01:34:41,459 --> 01:34:51,136
Watch your voice.

1028
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:59,944
I'll do the concert.I'll do it well. But...

1029
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:05,025
Get rid of these.

1030
01:35:05,025 --> 01:35:24,936
They're repulsive and scary.

1031
01:35:24,936 --> 01:35:28,606
I'm fine.It doesn't hurt.

1032
01:35:28,606 --> 01:35:32,051
It's nothing, compared towhat I went through.

1033
01:35:32,051 --> 01:35:37,182
I cut off my bone and skin.

1034
01:35:37,182 --> 01:35:44,757
Laying on the table...

1035
01:35:44,757 --> 01:35:52,864
You know whom I thought of?

1036
01:35:52,864 --> 01:35:57,268
I never knew...

1037
01:35:57,268 --> 01:36:00,238
I thought that was painful.

1038
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:16,421
But this is worse.

1039
01:36:16,421 --> 01:36:35,607
You broke my heart.Tissue won't fix it.

1040
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:38,051
Now you cut yourself?

1041
01:36:38,051 --> 01:36:43,948
You should be able to fixsomething simple like this.

1042
01:36:43,948 --> 01:36:46,951
Give it a shot, okay?

1043
01:36:46,951 --> 01:36:59,063
Thanks, Doc.

1044
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:05,703
That ticket is expensive.Please, come.

1045
01:37:05,703 --> 01:37:13,545
I want money,not a concert ticket.

1046
01:37:13,545 --> 01:37:22,186
God damn it!It's complimentary!

1047
01:37:22,186 --> 01:37:30,261
What's wrong?Aren't you going to the concert?

1048
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:37,468
Someone sent this.

1049
01:37:37,468 --> 01:37:41,539
I'm sorry.I'll take the responsibility.

1050
01:37:41,539 --> 01:37:43,841
You will?

1051
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:51,683
Okay then.Cancel the concert.

1052
01:37:51,683 --> 01:37:55,486
I can't do that.

1053
01:37:55,486 --> 01:37:59,357
Dad, that's unnecessary.

1054
01:37:59,357 --> 01:38:03,194
I will quit.

1055
01:38:03,194 --> 01:38:08,766
Stay out. If we don't,this will go to the press.

1056
01:38:08,766 --> 01:38:12,804
That she was a singerfor Ammy.

1057
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:16,207
It isn't just about the label.

1058
01:38:16,207 --> 01:38:24,082
What about cosmetics?You'll eat them all?

1059
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:27,986
You know the contractinside and out.

1060
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:32,019
Unless you'll pay penalty,do as I say.

1061
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:35,293
Put out her nude album.

1062
01:38:35,293 --> 01:38:37,043
Do it before it's too late.

1063
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:40,465
We'll squeeze out of herwhatever we can.

1064
01:38:40,465 --> 01:38:43,601
Dad!

1065
01:38:43,601 --> 01:38:47,674
You're grown old.And scared.

1066
01:38:47,674 --> 01:39:24,609
Son of a bitch,I made you who you are!

1067
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:27,645
Company's stock price...

1068
01:39:27,645 --> 01:39:31,482
You forgotwho helped it rise?

1069
01:39:31,482 --> 01:39:35,553
I know who's behind this.I'll handle it.

1070
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:38,923
We're doing the concert.

1071
01:39:38,923 --> 01:39:48,099
And it'll be a success.

1072
01:39:48,099 --> 01:39:53,471
Let's go.We have a concert to do.

1073
01:39:53,471 --> 01:40:05,016
Get up.

1074
01:40:05,016 --> 01:40:09,687
Damn, he messed it up.

1075
01:40:09,687 --> 01:40:17,228
I made it worse.

1076
01:40:17,228 --> 01:40:23,134
You said it didn't hurt.But it does.

1077
01:40:23,134 --> 01:40:51,829
Don't worry about it.I'll handle Ammy.

1078
01:40:51,829 --> 01:40:57,201
Jung-min, last night...I'm sorry.

1079
01:40:57,201 --> 01:41:01,105
About what?

1080
01:41:01,105 --> 01:41:06,031
You brought my dad?

1081
01:41:06,031 --> 01:41:08,913
Your dad?

1082
01:41:08,913 --> 01:41:15,119
Oh, that old man?He slept at my place.

1083
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:23,227
Cause he was lockedout of the hospital.

1084
01:41:23,227 --> 01:41:29,066
And, doesn't he have tosee your concert?

1085
01:41:29,066 --> 01:41:32,017
If you got a problem,tell me.

1086
01:41:32,017 --> 01:41:39,944
Then again,he means nothing to you.

1087
01:41:39,944 --> 01:42:05,036
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!

1088
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:11,843
Why can't you do it?

1089
01:42:11,843 --> 01:42:52,383
I said it was okay.

1090
01:42:52,383 --> 01:42:55,586
Don't you get it?

1091
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,099
This isn't for menor Ammy.

1092
01:42:58,099 --> 01:43:03,261
It's your show.Do it for yourself.

1093
01:43:03,261 --> 01:44:45,563
For nobody else,but yourself.

1094
01:44:45,563 --> 01:44:55,373
Stop!

1095
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:59,677
I can't do this.

1096
01:44:59,677 --> 01:45:03,914
I really can't.

1097
01:45:03,914 --> 01:45:13,491
I'm sorry.I'm really sorry.

1098
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:17,495
I'm not Jenny.

1099
01:45:17,495 --> 01:45:28,572
I'm Hanna. KANG Hanna.

1100
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:36,714
I was an ugly, fat girl.

1101
01:45:36,714 --> 01:45:48,893
So... I sang for someone elsehiding in the back.

1102
01:45:48,893 --> 01:45:53,013
Then I got plastic surgery.

1103
01:45:53,013 --> 01:46:04,575
From head to toe...Everything.

1104
01:46:04,575 --> 01:46:08,079
Now that I'm pretty...

1105
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:13,117
I can sing.

1106
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:18,923
I've been in love.

1107
01:46:18,923 --> 01:46:26,664
I was so happybeing Jenny.

1108
01:46:26,664 --> 01:46:31,268
But I'm sorry.

1109
01:46:31,268 --> 01:46:39,071
I ruined it.

1110
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:44,181
I've deserted my friend.

1111
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:48,419
My dad.

1112
01:46:48,419 --> 01:46:52,923
And myself.

1113
01:46:52,923 --> 01:47:00,998
I don't know whoI am anymore.

1114
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:04,735
I can't remember

1115
01:47:04,735 --> 01:47:10,241
what I looked like.I can't.

1116
01:47:10,241 --> 01:47:35,299
I miss you, Hanna.

1117
01:47:35,299 --> 01:47:38,335
Hanna...

1118
01:47:38,335 --> 01:47:43,034
That's me.

1119
01:47:43,034 --> 01:47:55,019
KANG Hanna.

1120
01:47:55,019 --> 01:47:58,255
It's okay.

1121
01:47:58,255 --> 01:48:23,214
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1122
01:48:23,214 --> 01:48:25,583
Dad!

1123
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:29,119
Jenny isn't here.

1124
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:34,792
But if you wanna hear...

1125
01:48:34,792 --> 01:48:39,797
...that fat, ugly girl sing...

1126
01:48:39,797 --> 01:48:47,571
Please, listen to me singonce for all.

1127
01:48:47,571 --> 01:48:53,277
# Crawling to me like a dream

1128
01:48:53,277 --> 01:49:00,551
# My little star up highDazzling my eyes

1129
01:49:00,551 --> 01:49:06,557
# Shining brightly

1130
01:49:06,557 --> 01:49:10,728
# Falling on my shoulders

1131
01:49:10,728 --> 01:49:14,965
# Don't be sad anymore

1132
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:22,606
# Holding my hands tightlyCaressing my wound

1133
01:49:22,606 --> 01:49:30,914
# It embraces me warmly

1134
01:49:30,914 --> 01:49:39,029
# Too hurt for my legs to walk

1135
01:49:39,029 --> 01:49:44,928
# Eyes so blurry with tears

1136
01:49:44,928 --> 01:49:50,102
# Before loveNever meant for me

1137
01:49:50,102 --> 01:49:54,371
# I will keep on smiling

1138
01:49:54,371 --> 01:49:57,071
# Dear moments with you

1139
01:49:57,071 --> 01:50:08,352
# Buried deep in my heart

1140
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:15,793
# Like those starsembroidered in my eyes

1141
01:50:15,793 --> 01:50:18,629
Look at you.

1142
01:50:18,629 --> 01:50:31,241
Your undershirt shows.

1143
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:33,011
Can you tell?

1144
01:50:33,011 --> 01:50:34,445
No.

1145
01:50:34,445 --> 01:50:38,649
No, you can't.

1146
01:50:38,649 --> 01:50:46,039
Dad, I really didn't know.

1147
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:54,598
Sang-jun, I love this.

1148
01:50:54,598 --> 01:51:00,137
# Like those starsembroidered in my eyes

1149
01:51:00,137 --> 01:51:13,951
# I will love you forever

1150
01:51:13,951 --> 01:51:16,488
"A Shocking ConfessionJenny was a fake!"

1151
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:24,395
Jenny went down like that.Completely.

1152
01:51:24,395 --> 01:51:29,006
But Hanna made it.

1153
01:51:29,006 --> 01:51:32,736
How? Beats me.

1154
01:51:32,736 --> 01:51:36,341
Lower it a bit.Make it lower.

1155
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:37,476
That's nice.

1156
01:51:37,476 --> 01:51:40,446
It's cool, isn't it?

1157
01:51:40,446 --> 01:51:42,546
Leave!

1158
01:51:42,546 --> 01:51:44,148
It's cool.

1159
01:51:44,148 --> 01:51:50,187
She's got more fans now.More anti-fans, too.

1160
01:51:50,187 --> 01:51:52,489
Hey!

1161
01:51:52,489 --> 01:51:55,726
"A pig"? I'll kill you!

1162
01:51:55,726 --> 01:51:57,261
Stay away from me!

1163
01:51:57,261 --> 01:52:00,799
I don't thinkshe likes me anymore.

1164
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:02,001
I'm doing my best.

1165
01:52:02,001 --> 01:52:08,205
Your best isn't enough.Doing well is what counts.

1166
01:52:08,205 --> 01:52:10,707
I don't wanna admit it...

1167
01:52:10,707 --> 01:52:13,712
...but people sayI like her more now.

1168
01:52:13,712 --> 01:52:17,714
What do you like about her?

1169
01:52:17,714 --> 01:52:22,486
I don't know.

1170
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:26,069
Because she's pretty?

1171
01:52:26,069 --> 01:52:32,596
Assholes like youwould say so.

1172
01:52:32,596 --> 01:52:35,032
Because she's innocent?

1173
01:52:35,032 --> 01:53:55,212
Assholes like mewould say so.

1174
01:53:55,212 --> 01:53:57,481
I'm the famous Dr. Lee,

1175
01:53:57,481 --> 01:54:00,784
known as Hand of God.

1176
01:54:00,784 --> 01:54:09,793
I might win the nextNobel Prize.

1177
01:54:09,793 --> 01:54:14,164
What do you want fixed?

1178
01:54:14,164 --> 01:54:19,087
My whole body.

1179
01:54:19,087 --> 99:59:59,999
Your whole body?

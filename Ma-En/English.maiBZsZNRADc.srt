1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Every time I close my eyes I see you in front of me

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I still can hear your voice calling out my name

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I remember all the stories you told me

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I miss the time you were around

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I'm so grateful for every moment I spent with you

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
'Cause I know life won't last forever

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You went so soon, so soon

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You left so soon, so soon

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have to move on 'cause I know it's been too long

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've got to stop the tears, keep my faith and be strong

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll try to take it all, even though it’s so hard

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I see you in my dreams but when I wake up you are gone

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Gone so soon

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Night and day, I still feel you are close to me

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I remember you in every prayer that I make

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Every single day may you be shaded by His mercy

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But life is not the same, and it will never be the same

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But I'm so thankful for every memory I shared with you

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
'Cause I know this life is not forever

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You went so soon, so soon

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You left so soon, so soon

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have to move on 'cause I know it's been too long

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've got to stop the tears, keep my faith and be strong

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll try to take it all, even though it’s so hard

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I see you in my dreams but when I wake up you are gone

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, there were days when I had no strength to go on

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I felt so weak and I just couldn't help asking: "Why?"

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, but I got through all the pain when I truly accepted

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That to God we all belong, and to Him we'll return, oh

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You went so soon, so soon

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You left so soon, so soon

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have to move on 'cause I know it's been too long

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've got to stop the tears, keep my faith and be strong

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll try to take it all, even though it’s so hard

35
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I see you in my dreams but when I wake up you are gone

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gone so soon

37
00:05:10,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So soon

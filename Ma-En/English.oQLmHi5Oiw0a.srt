1
00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:05,747
Is the proportion true or false
that 3/12 or 3:12 is

2
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:09,964
equal to 5/35 or 5:35?

3
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:12,314
Now to figure this out, we
just have to figure out

4
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,547
whether these are equivalent
fractions, and the easiest way

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,830
to do that, is to put both of
them in simplified form, and

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,499
see if we get the same answer.

7
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:24,646
So let's try with 3/12 first.
So if we have 3/12, both the

8
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:28,113
numerator and the denominator
are divisible by 3.

9
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,531
So let's divide by 3.

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,896
So divide the numerator by
3, and let's divide the

11
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,844
denominator by 3.

12
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:37,030
We get 3 divided by 3 is 1.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,063
12 divided by 3 is 4.

14
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:41,763
So 3/12 is the same
thing is 1/4.

15
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:45,433
Now let's try do the same
thing for 5/35.

16
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:51,995
5 over 35-- I'm leaving some
space so we can divide-- well,

17
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:54,596
these are both divisible by 5,
so let's divide the numerator

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,430
and the denominator by 5.

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,564
So if we divide the numerator by
5 and the denominator by 5,

20
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:06,498
the numerator, 5 divided
by 5 is 1, and then 35

21
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:08,497
divided by 5 is 7.

22
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:14,181
So this thing is equivalent to
saying that 1/4 is equal to

23
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:19,063
1/7, which is clearly
not true.

24
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:23,649
This is clearly not true, so
the proportion is false.

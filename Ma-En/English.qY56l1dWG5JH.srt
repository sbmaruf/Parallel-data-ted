1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,950
Use the associative law of
multiplication to write-- and

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,910
here they have 12 times 3 in
parentheses, and then they

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,360
want us to multiply that times
10-- in a different way.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,730
Simplify both expressions
to show they

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,090
have identical results.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,160
So the way that they wrote it
is-- let me just rewrite it.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,160
So they have 12 times 3 in
parentheses, and then they

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,410
multiply that times 10.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,820
Now whenever something is in
parentheses, that means do

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,390
that first. So this literally
says let's do the 12 times 3

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,920
first. Now, what
is 12 times 3?

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,670
It's 36.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,950
So this evaluates to 36, and
then we still have that times

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,040
10 over there.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,870
And we know the trick.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,960
Whenever we multiply something
times a power of ten, we just

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,930
add the number of zeroes that we
have at the back of it, so

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,440
this is going to be 360.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,390
This is going to be
equal to 360.

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,160
Now, the associative law of
multiplication, once again, it

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,950
sounds like a very
fancy thing.

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,630
All that means is it doesn't
matter how we associate the

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,370
multiplication or it doesn't
matter how we put the

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,310
parentheses, we're going to get
the same answer, so let me

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,840
write it down again.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,020
If we were to do 12 times 3
times 10, if we just wrote it

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,180
like this without parentheses,
if we just went left to right,

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,000
that would essentially be
exactly what we just did here

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,860
on the left.

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,890
But the associative law
of multiplication

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,910
says, you know what?

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,560
We can multiply the 3 times 10
first and then multiply the

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,260
12, and we're going to get the
exact same answer as if we

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,710
multiplied the 12 times
the 3 and then the 10.

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,620
So let's just verify
it for ourselves.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,580
So 3 times 10 is 30, and we
still want to multiply the 12

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,490
times that.

38
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,150
Now, what's 12 times 30?

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,230
And we've seen this several
times before.

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,390
You can view it as a 12 times
3, which is 36, but we still

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,970
have this 0 here.

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,340
So that is also equal to 360.

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,720
So it didn't matter how we
associated the multiplication.

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,570
You can do the 12 times 3 first
or you can do the 3

45
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,340
times 10 first. Either way, they
both evaluated to 360.

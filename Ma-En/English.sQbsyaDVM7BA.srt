1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,310
There's a classic
story out there

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,500
and it has to do with
a character named Jack.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,290
And you may have
heard this story,

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,780
but I'm sure that there
is parts of that story

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,890
that you have not heard.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,740
And so I'm actually going to
just try to fill in those parts

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,630
that you get a complete
idea of what happened.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,510
Now Jack came across, a long
time ago, a famous, now famous

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,780
beanstalk.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,650
So this beanstalk was
growing and growing

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,160
and had these huge leaves.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,120
And actually Jack
used these leaves

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,610
to make his way
up this beanstalk.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,260
And so, this is how this
beanstalk became very famous.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,510
Because it basically allowed
Jack to use it like a ladder.

16
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:46,049
Now the part that
we don't hear about

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,600
is what was going on between
Jack and the beanstalk.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,910
He was exercising, right?

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,350
So he was actually making
a lot of carbon dioxide.

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,690
He was making a lot of this
gas, this carbon dioxide gas,

21
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,130
as kind of a waste
product as he was running,

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,910
scampering up the beanstalk.

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,020
And the beanstalk was helping
him physically, but also

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,260
was actually providing him
with very precious oxygen.

25
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,360
In fact, if the
beanstalk didn't do that,

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,950
he may not have even made it.

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,960
And we also, we
don't know for sure,

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,890
but we think that perhaps
some of this story

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,660
may have taken place
during the day.

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,560
And in fact, we
know that sunlight

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,770
is quite important
for this process.

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,670
And we think that this process,
the name that we give it

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,910
for the beanstalk anyway,
is photosynthesis.

34
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,910
And so what is really
happening-- we're actually

35
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,480
going to kind of write it
out here-- between Jack

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,750
and the beanstalk, and really
between all plants and animals?

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,320
What is this process
between them?

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,870
We know that on
the one hand, you

39
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,360
have beanstalks
doing photosynthesis,

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,540
and on the other hand,
you have folks like Jack

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,190
doing cellular respiration.

42
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,600
And there's this really kind
of interesting symbiosis.

43
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:03,274
And by that I just
mean that the two are

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,020
kind of relying on each
other to really work.

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,560
So you kind of need both
of them to work well.

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,880
And so let's actually
take a moment

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,770
to write out these
processes that

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,590
are happening between
Jack and the beanstalk.

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,860
So let's start with the
process of photosynthesis,

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,530
the beanstalk.

51
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,050
So on the one hand,
you've got what?

52
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,830
You've got water
because, of course,

53
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,030
the beanstalk needs water,
and you've got carbon dioxide.

54
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,110
And I'm going to do
carbon oxide in orange.

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,760
So it's taking in water
and carbon dioxide.

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,080
And it's going to
put out, it's going

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,120
to actually take
these ingredients

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,210
if you want to think of
it as kind of cooking,

59
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,711
it's going to take
these ingredients

60
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,280
and it's going to put out.

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,630
It's going to put out what?

62
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,040
Oxygen and glucose.

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,280
So I'll put glucose up
top and oxygen down below.

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,540
So these are the inputs and
outputs of photosynthesis.

65
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,390
And on the other side, you've
got something very similar.

66
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,300
You've got inputs.

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,680
You've got glucose
and oxygen going in.

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
You're going to start seeing
some serious similarities here.

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,240
You've got glucose
and oxygen going in.

70
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,880
So Jack is taking
in those two things.

71
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,360
And he is again, of
course, processing them.

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,900
And he's putting out
water and carbon dioxide.

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,800
So this looks really,
really nice, right?

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,860
Looks perfect actually.

75
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,130
Because everything
is nice and balanced.

76
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,050
And you can see how it
makes perfect sense that,

77
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,640
not only did Jack
need the beanstalk,

78
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
but actually it sounds like
the beanstalk needed Jack,

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,750
based on how I've drawn it.

80
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,289
Now remember, none
of this would even

81
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,710
happen if there was no sunlight.

82
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,550
So we actually
need light energy.

83
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,589
In fact, that's the whole
purpose of this, right?

84
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,100
Getting energy.

85
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,270
So you have to have
some light energy.

86
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,320
I'm going to put
a big plus sign,

87
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,790
and I might even circle it
because it's so important.

88
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,490
I don't want you to
lose track of it.

89
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,865
And on the other
side, of course,

90
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,110
Jack is getting
something as well.

91
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,470
He's getting chemical energy.

92
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,110
In fact, he's using
the chemical energy

93
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,590
to help him climb the beanstalk.

94
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,589
And so the chemical
energy comes in the form

95
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:24,759
of what we call ATP, which is
just a molecule of high energy.

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,710
And so Jack and the
beanstalk are basically

97
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,100
going from light energy to
chemical energy using these two

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,990
equations.

99
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:36,317
Now here's the part that
people don't always appreciate.

100
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,860
And I'm actually going to
take just a moment to show you

101
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,450
that this isn't the full story.

102
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,620
There's actually something
else going on as well.

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,030
And that is that
there's actually

104
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,360
some cellular respiration
happening on the plant's side.

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,570
So remember, not only does
the human, or the Jack,

106
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,810
need energy, but
so does the plant.

107
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,270
The plant needs energy as well.

108
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,210
And in fact, if it takes
in light energy right here,

109
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,890
it needs to find
a way to actually,

110
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,510
eventually get some
chemical energy itself,

111
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,200
so that it can do all the
things it needs to do.

112
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,580
It doesn't need to run
because plants don't

113
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,770
move in that sense, but it
might need to make new roots,

114
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,490
and may need to make a
flower, and all these things

115
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,020
take energy.

116
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,410
So actually, photosynthesis
is happening during the day,

117
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,780
but at all times plants
are also capable of doing

118
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,580
cellular respiration,
just like humans are.

119
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,740
So humans and plants
have actually more

120
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,140
in common than you might think.

121
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,610
So, this brings up
an obvious question.

122
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:48,470
Why in the world would a plant
send its glucose and oxygen

123
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,970
this way, when it
needs it itself?

124
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,660
You know, why would it
actually get rid of it?

125
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,030
Well, the truth is, that the
glucose ends up oftentimes

126
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,780
in fruits and
vegetables that we eat.

127
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,670
But as far as the oxygen goes,
it makes an excess of oxygen.

128
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,710
So there is actually
enough oxygen

129
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,250
to go both to us, or to Jack
and to be used by itself.

130
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,160
So it actually has an excess
of oxygen that it's making.

131
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,730
So this is actually kind of
interesting and good to know.

132
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,690
Now if you think
about it, if I was to,

133
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,480
let's say sketch out a planet.

134
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,150
Let's draw a little planet over
here, and ask you the question.

135
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,570
If this was your planet
Earth, and you've

136
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,650
got thousands, instead of
just one Jack, let's say now

137
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,180
you have thousands of Jacks
and thousands of beanstalks,

138
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,690
in fact, not even thousands.

139
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,150
Let's say billions, because
really, that's what we have.

140
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,830
We have a planet full of humans,
and full of other animals,

141
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,390
and full of plants.

142
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,210
What would the
atmosphere look like?

143
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,560
This is the atmosphere.

144
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,740
What would the
atmosphere look like?

145
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,510
Well you'd guess that
the atmosphere is gas.

146
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,550
And so what would
those gases be?

147
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,120
Well, the way I've
drawn things again,

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,240
it looks like I've got
lots of oxygen and lots

149
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,540
of carbon dioxide.

150
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,300
So I would say well, I guess
there must be, I don't know,

151
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,350
maybe 50-50 carbon
dioxide and oxygen

152
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,190
based on what we know so far.

153
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,450
And the truth is, that's
actually not true.

154
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,280
That if you actually look at
air, if you actually break down

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,520
the atmosphere or air-- I'm
just going to write "air" here--

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,450
if you actually break
it down, turns out

157
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,130
that the ratios are
actually a little different.

158
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,480
So for example, oxygen makes
up about 21% of our air.

159
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,380
This is our air breakdown.

160
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,260
And carbon dioxide makes
up about less than 1%.

161
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,280
So, that leaves you wondering,
what the heck is making up

162
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
all that other parts of air?

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,810
What is it made of?

164
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,560
And in truth, it's
about 78% nitrogen.

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,980
Now you know, you've got
nitrogen in your proteins,

166
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,480
we've got nitrogen in our DNA.

167
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,170
So nitrogen is part of us and
is part of many, many living

168
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,160
things.

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,520
But nitrogen gas,
specifically, is actually N2.

170
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,400
And N2, this nitrogen gas,
really is not too reactive.

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,260
It kind of just
hangs out by itself,

172
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,760
does not like to
react with things.

173
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,460
So, looking at our
little atmosphere graph,

174
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,930
if you want to now
think about it,

175
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,840
knowing that we've got very
little carbon dioxide and about

176
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,230
21% oxygen-- you could
think of oxygen being,

177
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,790
let's say, something like
that-- well then relative

178
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,399
to that nitrogen
would be much more.

179
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,120
You have much more
nitrogen hanging out.

180
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,730
And so this is really what
our atmosphere looks like.

181
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,230
It looks more filled with
nitrogen than anything else.

182
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,670
And in terms of
carbon dioxide, it's

183
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,459
just got a little smidge
of carbon dioxide.

184
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,470
Maybe right there.

185
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,180
That could be carbon dioxide,
maybe even less than that.

186
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,260
So this is really what
our atmosphere looks like,

187
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,100
visually.

188
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,520
And the nitrogen again,
it's making up the majority.

189
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,260
And if you actually wonder where
all that nitrogen is coming

190
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,050
from, because I didn't mention
it in any of the equations,

191
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,600
most of that nitrogen
has been around,

192
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
scientists think,
since the beginning

193
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,230
of when earth even
had an atmosphere.

194
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:21,654
And that nitrogen,
we're just kind

195
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,160
of carrying with
us at all times.

196
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,130
And that's why it just
remains around 78%,

197
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,530
and will probably remain there
for many, many years to come.

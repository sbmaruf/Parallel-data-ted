00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, checkers is an interesting game.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here's the typical board of the game of checkers.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Your pieces might look like this,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and your opponent's pieces might look like this.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And apart from some very cryptic rules in checkers,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which I won't really discuss here, the board basically tells you

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
everything there is to know about checkers, so it's clearly fully observable.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It is deterministic because your move and your opponent's move

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
very clearly affect the state of the board in ways that have

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
absolutely no stochasticity.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is also discrete because there's finitely many action choices

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and finitely many board positions,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and obviously, it is adversarial, since your opponent is out to get you.

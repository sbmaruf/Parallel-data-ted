1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is a magic that uses technology

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to create illusions.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So I would like to show you something I've been working on.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's an application

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that I think will be useful for artists --

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
multimedia artists in particular.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It synchronizes videos

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
across multiple screens of mobile devices.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I borrowed these three iPods

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
from people here in the audience

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to show you what I mean.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I'm going to use them to tell you

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a little bit about my favorite subject:

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
deception.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
(Music)

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One of my favorite magicians

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is Karl Germain.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He had this wonderful trick

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
where a rosebush would bloom

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
right in front of your eyes.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But it was his production of a butterfly

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that was the most beautiful.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
(Recording) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the creation of life.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
(Applause)

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
(Music)

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Marco Tempest: When asked about deception,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
he said this:

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Announcer: Magic is the only honest profession.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A magician promises to deceive you --

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and he does.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
MT: I like to think of myself as an honest magician.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I use a lot of tricks,

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which means

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that sometimes I have to lie to you.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now I feel bad about that.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But people lie every day.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(Ringing) Hold on.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Girl in Phone: Hey, where are you?

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You've all done it.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
(Laughter)

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Lady: I'll be ready in just a minute, darling.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Man: It's just what I've always wanted.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Woman: You were great.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
MT: Deception,

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
it's a fundamental part of life.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now polls show

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that men tell twice as many lies

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
as women --

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
assuming the women they ask told the truth.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
(Laughing)

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We deceive to gain advantage

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and to hide our weaknesses.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Chinese general Sun Tzu

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
said that all war

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
was based on deception.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oscar Wilde

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
said the same thing of romance.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Some people

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
deceive for money.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's play a game.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Three cards, three chances.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Announcer: One five will get you 10, 10 will get you 20.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now where's the lady?

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where is the queen?

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
MT: This one?

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sorry. You lose.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, I didn't deceive you.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You deceived yourself.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Self-deception.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's when we convince ourselves

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that a lie is the truth.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Compulsive gamblers

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
are experts at self-deception.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
(Slot machine noise)

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They believe they can win.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They forget the times they lose.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The brain is very good at forgetting.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Bad experiences

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
quickly disappear.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos,

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we are so wonderfully optimistic.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Our self-deception

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
becomes a positive illusion --

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
why movies

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures;

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
why we believe Romeo

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
when he says he loves Juliet;

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and why single notes of music,

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
when played together,

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
become a sonata and conjure up meaning.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's "Clair de Lune."

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Its composer called Debussy

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
said that art

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
was the greatest deception of all.

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Art is a deception

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that creates real emotions --

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
a lie that creates a truth.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And when you give yourself over to that deception,

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
it becomes magic.

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,000
(Applause)

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
(Applause)

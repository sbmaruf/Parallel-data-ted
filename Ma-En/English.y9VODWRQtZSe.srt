1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,840
A ticket agent sells 42
tickets to a play.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
The tickets cost $29 each.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,600
Use rounding to estimate the
total dollars taken in from

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,320
the sale of the tickets.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,950
Now if we wanted the exact
number, we could say 42 times

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,710
29, and we could work out the
multiplication, but they

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,430
essentially want us to be able
to do it in our head.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,310
We want to round the numbers
first and then multiply.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,160
So if we want to round, and
really we just have two places

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,670
here, so if we're going to round
anything, it's going to

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,130
be to the nearest ten because
that's the largest place we

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,670
have. So if we round 42 to the
nearest ten-- we've done this

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,680
drill many times-- 2 in the ones
place is the less than 5,

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,030
so we're going to round down.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,540
The nearest ten is 40.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,050
We're going to round
down to 40.

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,940
29, if we round to the nearest
ten, 9 in the ones place is

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,670
greater than or equal to
5, so we round up.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,100
The nearest ten is 30.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,240
And another way to
think about it.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,990
Just say, well, you know, 42,
that's pretty close to 40.

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,870
29 is pretty close to 30.

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,450
Those are literally the nearest
multiples of ten that

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,520
I can figure out, so
now I can multiply.

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,900
And here, once again, we can
use-- you could call it a

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,540
trick, but hopefully, you
understand why it works.

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,830
But 30 times 40, instead of
you saying, well, this is

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,050
going to be the same thing as 3
times 4, but we're going to

29
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,290
put two zeroes at
the end of it.

30
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,180
30 times 40 is the same thing as
3 times 4 with two zeroes,

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,860
so let's do that.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,650
So you have 3 times 4 is 12,
which we know, and then we

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,340
have two zeroes.

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,820
We got that zero, so let's stick
that zero there, and

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,760
then we got that blue
zero there, so let's

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,080
put that over there.

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,080
So they're going to have roughly
$1,200 taken it from

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,400
sales of the tickets.

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,510
That is our estimate.

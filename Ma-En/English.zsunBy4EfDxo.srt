1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,470
We need to find the vertex
and the axis of

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,390
symmetry of this graph.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,950
The whole point of doing this
problem is so that you

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,240
understand what the vertex
and axis of symmetry is.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,690
And just as a bit of a
refresher, if a parabola looks

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,280
like this, the vertex is the
lowest point here, so this

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,260
minimum point here, for an
upward opening problem.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,610
If the parabola opens downward
like this, the vertex is the

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,710
topmost point right like that.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,970
It's the maximum point.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,110
And the axis of symmetry is
the line that you could

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,900
reflect the parabola around,
and it's symmetric.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,610
So that's the axis
of symmetry.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,065
That is a reflection of the
left-hand side along that axis

15
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:37,710
of symmetry.

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,330
Same thing if it's a
downward-opening parabola.

17
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,370
And the general way of telling
the difference between an

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,960
upward-opening and a
downward-opening parabola is

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,420
that this will have a positive
coefficient on the x squared

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,260
term, and this will have
a negative coefficient.

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,910
And we'll see that in a little
bit more detail.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,460
So let's just work on this.

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,450
Now, in order to figure out the
vertex, there's a quick

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,600
and dirty formula, but I'm not
going to do the formula here

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,000
because the formula really tells
you nothing about how

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,540
you got it.

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,740
But I'll show you how to apply
the formula at the end of this

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,245
video, if you see this on a math
test and just want to do

29
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,110
it really quickly.

30
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,660
But we're going to do it the
slow, intuitive way first.

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,940
So let's think about how we can
find either the maximum or

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,710
the minimum point of
this parabola.

33
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,800
So the best way I can think
of doing it is to

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,900
complete the square.

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,400
And it might seem like a very
foreign concept right now, but

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,490
let's just do it one
step at a time.

37
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,340
So I can rewrite this as y is
equal to-- well, I can factor

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,330
out a negative 2.

39
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:39,320
It's equal to negative 2 times
x squared minus 4x minus 4.

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,065
And I'm going to put the
minus 4 out here.

41
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,990
And this is where I'm going
to complete the square.

42
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,810
Now, what I want to do is
express the stuff in the

43
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,430
parentheses as a sum of a
perfect square and then some

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,610
number over here.

45
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,400
And I have x squared minus 4x.

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,970
If I wanted this to be a perfect
square, it would be a

47
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,550
perfect square if I had a
positive 4 over here.

48
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,870
If I had a positive 4 over
there, then this would be a

49
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,870
perfect square.

50
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,070
It would be x minus 2 squared.

51
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,780
And I got the 4, because I said,
well, I want whatever

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,110
half of this number is,
so half of negative

53
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,530
4 is negative 2.

54
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,500
Let me square it.

55
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,470
That'll give me a positive
4 right there.

56
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,470
But I can't just add
a 4 willy-nilly to

57
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,680
one side of an equation.

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,550
I either have to add it to the
other side or I would have to

59
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,900
then just subtract it.

60
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,850
So here I haven't changed
equation.

61
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,890
I added 4 and then
I subtracted 4.

62
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,050
I just added zero to this little
expression here, so it

63
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,880
didn't change it.

64
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,270
But what it does allow me to do
is express this part right

65
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:42,170
here as a perfect square. x
squared minus 4x plus 4 is x

66
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,470
minus 2 squared.

67
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,380
It is x minus 2 squared.

68
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,340
And then you have this
negative 2 out front

69
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,420
multiplying everything, and
then you have a negative 4

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,090
minus negative 4, minus
8, just like that.

71
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,490
So you have y is equal to
negative 2 times this entire

72
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,200
thing, and now we can multiply
out the negative 2 again.

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,810
So we can distribute it.

74
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,050
Y is equal to negative 2 times
x minus 2 squared.

75
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,420
And then negative 2 times
negative 8 is plus 16.

76
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,270
Now, all I did is algebraically

77
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,110
arrange this equation.

78
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,970
But what this allows us to do
is think about what the

79
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,370
maximum or minimum point
of this equation is.

80
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,250
So let's just explore
this a little bit.

81
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,300
This quantity right here, x
minus 2 squared, if you're

82
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,360
squaring anything, this
is always going to

83
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,380
be a positive quantity.

84
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,220
That right there is
always positive.

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,300
But it's being multiplied
by a negative number.

86
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,210
So if you look at the larger
context, if you look at the

87
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,160
always positive multiplied by
the negative 2, that's going

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,450
to be always negative.

89
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,150
And the more positive that this
number becomes when you

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,740
multiply it by a negative, the
more negative this entire

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,990
expression becomes.

92
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,560
So if you think about it,
this is going to be a

93
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,010
downward-opening parabola.

94
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,040
We have a negative coefficient
out here.

95
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,920
And the maximum point on this
downward-opening parabola is

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,640
when this expression right here
is as small as possible.

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,290
If this gets any larger, it's
just multiplied by a negative

98
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,630
number, and then you subtract
it from 16.

99
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,920
So if this expression right here
is 0, then we have our

100
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,490
maximum y value, which is 16.

101
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,250
So how do we get x is
equal to 0 here?

102
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,860
Well, the way to get x minus
2 equal to 0-- so

103
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,040
let's just do it.

104
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,400
x minus 2 is equal to 0,
so that happens when

105
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,220
x is equal to 2.

106
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,020
So when x is equal to 2,
this expression is 0.

107
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,240
0 times a negative number,
it's all 0, and then y is

108
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,240
equal to 16.

109
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,320
This is our vertex, this
is our maximum point.

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,170
We just reasoned through it,
just looking at the algebra,

111
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,300
that the highest value this
can take on is 16.

112
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,390
As x moves away from 2 in
the positive or negative

113
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,420
direction, this quantity right
here, it might be negative or

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,630
positive, but when you square
it, it's going to be positive.

115
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,240
And when you multiply it by
negative 2, it's going to

116
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,440
become negative and it's going
to subtract from 16.

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,010
So our vertex right here
is x is equal to 2.

118
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,170
Actually, let's say each
of these units are 2.

119
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:28,060
So this is 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

120
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,070
So my vertex is here.

121
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,150
That is the absolute maximum
point for this parabola.

122
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,020
And its axis of symmetry is
going to be along the line x

123
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,470
is equal to 2, along the
vertical line x is equal to 2.

124
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,300
That is going to be its
axis of symmetry.

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,550
And now if we're just curious
for a couple of other points,

126
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,060
just because we want to plot
this thing, we could say,

127
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,300
well, what happens when
x is equal to 0?

128
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,990
That's an easy one.

129
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,420
When x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 8.

130
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,930
So when x is equal to 0, we have
1, 2, 3, 4-- oh, well,

131
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,530
these are 2.

132
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,050
2, 4, 6, 8.

133
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,090
It's right there.

134
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,250
This is an axis of symmetry.

135
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,760
So when x is equal to 3, y is
also going to be equal to 8.

136
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,390
So this parabola is a really
steep and narrow one that

137
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,180
looks something like this, where
this right here is the

138
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,370
maximum point.

139
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,260
Now I told you this is the slow
and intuitive way to do

140
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,950
the problem.

141
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,350
If you wanted a quick and dirty
way to figure out a

142
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,300
vertex, there is a formula
that you can derive it

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,330
actually, doing this exact same
process we just did, but

144
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,130
the formula for the vertex, or
the x-value of the vertex, or

145
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,500
the axis of symmetry, is x is
equal to negative b over 2a.

146
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,140
So if we just apply this-- but,
you know, this is just

147
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,660
kind of mindless application
of a formula.

148
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,130
I wanted to show you the
intuition why this formula

149
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,010
even exists.

150
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,240
But if you just mindlessly
apply this, you'll get--

151
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,490
what's b here?

152
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,340
So x is equal to negative--
b here is 8.

153
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,240
8 over 2 times a.

154
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,690
a right here is a negative 2.

155
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,520
2 times negative 2.

156
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,270
So what is that going
to be equal to?

157
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,230
It is negative 8 over negative
4, which is equal to 2, which

158
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,390
is the exact same thing we
got by reasoning it out.

159
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,400
And when x is equal to
2, y is equal to 16.

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,090
Same exact result there.

161
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,250
That's the point 2 comma 16.

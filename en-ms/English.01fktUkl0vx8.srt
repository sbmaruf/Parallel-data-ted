1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050


2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,550
We're asked to multiply
65 times 1.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,760
So literally, we just need to
multiply 65-- we could write

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,150
it is a times sign like that or
we could write it as a dot

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,860
like that-- but this
means 65 times 1.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,080
And there's two ways
to interpret this.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,420
You could view this as the
number 65 one time or you

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,980
could view this as the
number 1 sixty-five

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,500
times, all added up.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,189
But either way, if you have one
65, this is literally just

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,130
going to be 65.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,810
Anything times 1 is going
to be that anything,

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,290
whatever this is.

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,580
Whatever this is times
1 is going to be

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,080
that same thing again.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:53,240
If I have just some kind of
placeholder here times 1, and

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,190
I could even write it as the
times symbol times 1, that's

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,600
going to be that same
placeholder.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,420


20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,810
So if I have 3 times 1,
I'm going to get 3.

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,630
If I have 5 times 1, I'm going
to get 5, because literally,

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,940
all this is saying
is 5 one time.

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,160
If I put-- I don't know-- 157
times 1, that'll be 157.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
I think you get the idea.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,599

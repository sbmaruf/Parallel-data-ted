[Occupy Wall St]

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This movement isn't about the 99 percent defeating or toppling the 1 percent.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
[Bank of America]  You know the next chapter of that story,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is that the 99 percent create a new 1 percent.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
[Charles Eisenstein, author, Sacred Economics] That's  not what it's about.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What we want to create is the more beautiful world our hearts tell us 

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is possible--a sacred world, a world that works for everybody

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a world that is healing, a world of peace. 

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can't just say:  We demand a world of peace.  

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Demands have to be specific.  

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Anything that people can articulate can only be articulated

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
within the language of the current political discourse.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and that entire political discourse is already too small.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
[NEWS] [OCCUPY WALL STREET...] and that's why making explicit demands

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
kind of reduces the movement

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and takes the heart out of it.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And so it's a real paradox, and so I think that

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
[LIFE OVER PROFIT] the movement actually understands that.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The system isn't working for the 1 percent either.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know, if you were a CEO, you would be making the same choices they do.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The institutions have their own logic.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Life is pretty bleak at the top too, 

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and all of the baubles of the rich, 

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
they're kind of this phony compensation. 

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
for the loss of what's really important.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the loss of community, the loss of connection, 

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the loss of intimacy, the loss of meaning.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Everybody wants to live a life of meaning,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and today we live in a money economy,

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
where we don't really depend on the gifts of anybody,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but we buy everything.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Therefore we don't really need anybody 

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because whoever grew my food, or made my clothes, 

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
or built my house, well, if they died

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
or if I alienate them, or if they don't like me, that's okay.  

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can just pay somebody else to do it.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's really hard to create community

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
if the underlying knowledge is we don't need each other.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So people kind of get together, and they fraternize, 

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or maybe they consume together, but joint consumption 

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
doesn't create intimacy--only joint creativity 

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and gifts create intimacy and connection.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
[♪faster, livelier music playing♪

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You have such gifts that are important.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just like every species has an important gift to give to an ecosystem,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and the extinction of any species hurts everybody.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The same is true of each person--that you have

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a necessary and important gift to give,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and that for a long time

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
our minds have told us

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that maybe we're imagining things, 

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that it's crazy to live according to what you want to give.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But I think now as more and more people wake up

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
to the truth--that we're here to give--

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and wake up to that desire and wake up to the fact

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that the other way isn't working anyway,

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the more reinforcement we have from people around us 

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that this isn't crazy--this makes sense.  

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is how to live.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and as we get that reinforcement,

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
then our minds and our logic no longer

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
have to fight against the logic of the heart, 

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
which wants us to be of service.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This shift of consciousness that inspires such things

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is universal in everybody,

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
99 percent and 1 percent, and it's awakening

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in different people in different ways.   

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think love is the felt experience 

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of a connection to another being.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
An economist says that essentially more for you is less for me,

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but the lover knows that more for you is more for me, too.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you love somebody, then their happiness is your happiness,

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
their pain is your pain.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your sense of self expands to include other beings.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's love; love is the expansion of the self to include the other,

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and that's a different kind of revolution.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
[OCCUPY YOUR HEART] There's no one to fight; there's no evil to fight.

00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,530
Welcome to the presentation
on multiplying and

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,270
dividing negative numbers.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,750
Let's get started.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,920
I think you're going to find
that multiplying and dividing

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,730
negative numbers are a lot
easier than it might

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,867
look initially. You just have to
remember a couple of rules.

7
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:16,168
And I am going to teach probably 
in the future like I'm actually going

8
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:20,840
to give you more intuition on
why there rules work.

9
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:25,220
So the basic rules are when you
multiply two negative numbers,

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:31,790
so let's say I had negative
2 times negative 2.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,970
First you just look at each
of the numbers as if there

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,240
was no negative sign.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,150
Well you say well, 2
times 2 that equals 4.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,670
And it turns out that if you
have a negative times a

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,175
negative, that that
equals a positive.

16
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,710
So let's write that
first rule down.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:54,285
A negative times a negative
equals a positive.

18
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:01,892
What if it was negative
2 times positive 2?

19
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:04,770
Well in this case, let's
first of all look at the

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,060
two numbers without signs.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,170
We know that 2 times 2 is 4.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,740
But here we have a negative
times a positive 2, and it

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,910
turns out that when you
multiply a negative times a

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,920
positive you get a negative.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,260
So that's another rule.

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:29,009
Negative times positive
is equal to negative.

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,786
What happens if you have a
positive 2 times a negative 2?

28
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:37,140
I think you'll probably guess
this one right, as you can tell

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,170
that these two are pretty much
the same thing by, I believe

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,800
it's the transitive property --
no, no I think it's the

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,860
communicative property.

32
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,700
I have to remember that.

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,780
But 2 times negative 2, this
also equals negative 4.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,640
So we have the final rule that
a positive times a negative

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,980
also equals the negative.

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,490
And actually these second
two rules, they're kind

37
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:04,990
of the same thing.

38
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,570
A negative times a positive
is a negative, or a positive

39
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,140
times a negative is negative.

40
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,730
You could also say that as when
the signs are different and

41
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,400
you multiply the two numbers,
you get a negative number.

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,890
And of course, you already know
what happens when you have a

43
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,550
positive times a positive.

44
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,840
Well that's just a positive.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,900
So let's review.

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,970
Negative times a
negative is a positive.

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,390
A negative times a
positive is a negative.

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,730
A positive times a
negative is a negative.

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,290
And positive times each
other equals positive.

50
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,980
I think that last little bit
completely confused you.

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,270
Maybe I can simplify
it for you.

52
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,350
What if I just told you if when
you're multiplying and they're

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:55,175
the same signs that gets
you a positive result.

54
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,840
And different signs gets
you a negative result.

55
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,780
So that would be either, let's
say a 1 times 1 is equal to 1,

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,120
or if I said negative 1 times
negative 1 is equal to

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,510
positive 1 as well.

58
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,150
Or if I said 1 times negative
1 is equal to negative 1, or

59
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,600
negative 1 times 1 is
equal to negative 1.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,130
You see how on the bottom two
problems I had two different

61
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,590
signs, positive 1
and negative 1?

62
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,120
And the top two problems,
this one right here

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
both 1s are positive.

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,970
And this one right here
both 1s are negative.

65
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,110
So let's do a bunch of problems
now, and hopefully it'll hit

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,510
the point home, and you also
could try to do along the

67
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,195
practice problems and also give
the hints and give you what rules to you so that should help you as well

68
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:06,750
So if I said negative 4 times
positive 3, well 4 times

69
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,820
3 is 12, and we have a
negative and a positive.

70
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,670
So different signs
mean negative.

71
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,060
So negative 4 times
3 is a negative 12.

72
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,310
That makes sense because we're
essentially saying what's

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,070
negative 4 times itself three
times, so it's like negative 4

74
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,800
plus negative 4 plus negative
4, which is negative 12.

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,120
If you've seen the video on
adding and subtracting negative

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,200
numbers, you probably
should watch first.

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,210
Let's do another one.

78
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,430
What if I said minus
2 times minus 7.

79
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,470
And you might want to pause the
video at any time to see if you

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,030
know how to do it and
then restart it to see

81
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,420
what the answer is.

82
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,190
Well, 2 times 7 is 14, and we
have the same sign here, so

83
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,530
it's a positive 14 -- normally
you wouldn't have to write the

84
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,930
positive but that makes it a
little bit more explicit.

85
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:05,880
And what if I had -- let me
think -- 9 times negative 5.

86
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,800
Well, 9 times 5 is 45.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,660
And once again, the signs are
different so it's a negative.

88
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,010
And then finally what if it I
had -- let me think of some

89
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:24,540
good numbers -- minus
6 times minus 11.

90
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,730
Well, 6 times 11 is 66 and
then it's a negative and

91
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,720
negative, it's a positive.

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,910
Let me give you a
trick problem.

93
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,100
What is 0 times negative 12?

94
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,740
Well, you might say that the
signs are different, but

95
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,460
0 is actually neither
positive nor negative.

96
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,315
And 0 times anything
is still 0.

97
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:52,080
It doesn't matter if the thing
you multiply it by is a

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,650
negative number or
a positive number.

99
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,630
0 times anything is still 0.

100
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,020
So let's see if we can apply
these same rules to division.

101
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,080
It actually turns out that
the same rules apply.

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,030
If I have 9 divided
by negative 3.

103
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,820
Well, first we say
what's 9 divided by 3?

104
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,640
Well that's 3.

105
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,920
And they have different signs,
positive 9, negative 3.

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,190
So different signs
means a negative.

107
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,520
9 divided by negative 3
is equal to negative 3.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,830
What is minus 16 divided by 8?

109
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,790
Well, once again, 16
divided by 8 is 2, but

110
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,370
the signs are different.

111
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,830
Negative 16 divided by positive
8, that equals negative 2.

112
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,140
Remember, different signs will
get you a negative result.

113
00:06:49,140 --> 00:07:00,500
What is minus 54
divided by minus 6?

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,320
Well, 54 divided by 6 is 9.

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,050
And since both terms, the
divisor and the dividend, are

116
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,890
both negative -- negative 54
and negative 6 -- it turns out

117
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,193
that the answer is positive.
Remember, same signs

118
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:18,985
result in a positive sign.

119
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,730
Let's do one more.

120
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,500
Obviously, 0 divided by
anything is still 0.

121
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,510
That's pretty straightforward.

122
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,200
And of course, you can't
divide anything by 0

123
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,210
-- that's undefined.

124
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,420
Let's do one more.

125
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,890
What is -- I'm just going to
think of random numbers --

126
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,930
4 divided by negative 1?

127
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,610
Well, 4 divided by 1 is 4,
but the signs are different.

128
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,130
So it's negative 4.

129
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,410
I hope that helps.

130
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,865
Now what I want you to do is
actually try

131
00:07:56,865 --> 00:08:01,380
as many of these multiplying and dividing
negative numbers as you can.

132
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,010
And you click on hints

133
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,260
and it'll remind you of which rule to use.

134
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,445
In your own time you might want
to actually think about

135
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,459
why these rules apply and what it
means

136
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,320
to multiply a negative number times a positive number.

137
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,982
And even more interesting, what
it means

138
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:20,230
to multiply a negative number times a negative number.

139
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,215
But I think at this point,

140
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:27,160
hopefully, you are ready to start doing some problems.

141
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,020
Good luck.

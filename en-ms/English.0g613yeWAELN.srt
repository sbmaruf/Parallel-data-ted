1
00:00:00,715 --> 00:00:06,990
We need to calculate 9.005 minus
3.6, or we could view it

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,067
as 9 and 5 thousandths
minus 3 and 6 tenths.

3
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,800
Whenever you do a subtracting
decimals problem, the most

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,063
important thing, and this is
true when you're adding decimals as well,

5
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:20,573
is you have
to line up the decimals.

6
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:31,877
So this is 9.005 minus 3.6.

7
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:34,863
So we've lined up the decimals,
and now we're ready

8
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:36,867
to subtract.

9
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,667
Now we can subtract.

10
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,133
So we start up here.

11
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,533
We have 5 minus nothing.

12
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:44,582
You can imagine this 3.6, or
this 3 and 6 tenths, we could

13
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:47,867
add two zeroes right here, and
it would be the same thing as

14
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:52,600
3 and 600 thousandths, which is
the same thing as 6 tenths.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,335
And when you look at it that
way, you'd say, OK, 5 minus 0

16
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:57,267
is nothing, and you just
write a 5 right there.

17
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,000
Or you could have said, if
there's nothing there, it

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,743
would have been 5 minus
nothing is 5.

19
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:04,467
Then you have 0 minus
0, which is just 0.

20
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:07,600
And then you have a 0 minus 6.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,200
And you can't subtract
6 from 0.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,818
So we need to get something into
this space right here,

23
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,933
and what we essentially are
going to do is regroup.

24
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:21,084
We're going to take one 1 from
the 9, so let's do that.

25
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:25,124
So let's take one 1 from the
9, so it becomes an 8.

26
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:26,667
And we need to do something
with that one 1.

27
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,933
We're going to put it
in the tenths place.

28
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:32,667
Now remember, one whole
is equal to 10 tenths.

29
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,333
This is the tenths place.

30
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,267
So then this will become 10.

31
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,242
Sometimes it's taught that
you're borrowing the 1, but

32
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:41,200
you're really taking it, and
you're actually taking 10 from

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,800
the place to your left.

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,812
So one whole is 10 tenths, we're
in the tenths place.

35
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:49,738
So you have 10 minus 6.

36
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:50,800
Let me switch colors.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,803
10 minus 6 is 4.

38
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:55,821
You have your decimal right
there, and then you have 8

39
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,533
minus 3 is 5.

40
00:01:58,533 --> 99:59:59,000
So 9.005 minus 3.6 is 5.405.

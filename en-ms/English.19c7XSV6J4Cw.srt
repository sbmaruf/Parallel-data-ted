1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,170
We are asked, what is the value
of the 100th term in

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,000
this sequence?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,640
And the first term is 15, then
9, then 3, then negative 3.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,820
So let's write it like
this, in a table.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,890
So if we have the term, just
so we have things straight,

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,070
and then we have the value.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,810
and then we have the
value of the term.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,260
I'll do a nice little
table here.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,770
So our first term
we saw is 15.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,730
Our second term is 9.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,330
Our third term is 3.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,940
I'm just really copying this
down, but I'm making sure we

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,720
associate it with
the right term.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,510
And then our fourth term
is negative 3.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,550
And they want us to figure out
what the 100th term of this

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,700
sequence is going to be.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,670
So let's see what's happening
here, if we can discern some

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,900
type of pattern.

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,300
So when we went from the
first term to the

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,770
second term, what happened?

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,270
15 to 9.

23
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,670
Looks like we went down by 6.

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,920
It's always good to think
about just how much the

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,910
numbers changed by.

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,860
That's always the simplest
type of pattern.

27
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,070
So we went down by 6,
we subtracted 6.

28
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,470
Then to go from 9 to 3, well,
we subtracted 6 again.

29
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,760

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,380
And then to go from 3 to
negative 3, well, we

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,900
subtracted 6 again.

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,750

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,610
So it looks like, every
term, you subtract 6.

34
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,900
So the second term is going to
be 6 less than the first term.

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,330
The third term is going to be
12 from the first term, or

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,690
negative 6 subtracted twice.

37
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,010
So in the third term, you
subtract negative 6 twice.

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,270
In the fourth term,
you subtract

39
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,710
negative 6 three times.

40
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,770
So whatever term you're looking
at, you subtract

41
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,610
negative 6 one less than
that many times.

42
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,210
Let me write this down just so--
Notice when your first

43
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,070
term, you have 15, and
you don't subtract

44
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,220
negative 6 at all.

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,430
Or you could say you subtract
negative 6 0 times.

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:07,850
So you can say this is 15 minus
negative 6 times-- or

47
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,290
let me write it better
this way --minus 0

48
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,860
times negative 6.

49
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,890
That's what that first
term is right there.

50
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,530
What's the second term?

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,680
This is 15.

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,140
We just subtracted negative
6 once, or you could say,

53
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,980
minus 1 times 6.

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,890
Or you could say plus
1 times negative 6.

55
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,700
Either way, we're subtracting
the 6 once.

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,330
Now what's happening here?

57
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:38,970
This is 15 minus 2 times
negative 6-- or, sorry

58
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,695
--minus 2 times 6.

59
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,850

60
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,300
We're subtracting a 6 twice.

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,960
What's the fourth term?

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,740
This is 15 minus-- We're
subtracting the 6 three times

63
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,870
from the 15, so minus
3 times 6.

64
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,370
So, if you see the pattern here,
when we have our fourth

65
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,940
term, we have the term
minus 1 right there.

66
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,530
The fourth term, we have a 3.

67
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,080
The third term, we have a 2.

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,800
The second term, we have a 1.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,250
So if we had the nth term, if we
just had the nth term here,

70
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,390
what's this going to be?

71
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,890
It's going to be 15 minus--
You see it's going to be n

72
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,320
minus 1 right here.

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,630
Right?

74
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,960
When n is 4, n minus 1 is 3.

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,000
When n is 3, n minus 1 is 2.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,080
When n is 2, n minus 1 is 1.

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,960
When n is 1, n minus 1 is 0.

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,420
So we're going to have this term
right here is n minus 1.

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,330
So minus n minus 1 times 6.

80
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,970
So if you want to figure out
the 100th term of this

81
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,780
sequence, I didn't even have
to write it in this general

82
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,450
term, you can just look
at this pattern.

83
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,590
It's going to be-- and I'll do
it in pink --the 100th term in

84
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,640
our sequence-- I'll continue
our table down

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,600
--is going to be what?

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:06,310
It's going to be 15 minus 100
minus 1, which is 99, times 6.

87
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,620
right?

88
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,900
I just follow the pattern.

89
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,340
1, you had a 0 here.

90
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,440
2, you had a 1 here.

91
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,730
3, you had a 2 here.

92
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,830
100, you're going to
have a 99 here.

93
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,950
So let's just calculate
what this is.

94
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,060
What's 99 times 6?

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,680
So 99 times 6-- Actually you
can do this in your head.

96
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,160
You could say that's going to
be 6 less than 100 times 6,

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,360
which is 600, and
6 less is 594.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
But if you didn't want to do
it that way, you just do it

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,310
the old-fashioned way.

100
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,090
6 times 9 is 54.

101
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,240
Carry the 5.

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,490
9 times 6, or 6 times 9 is 54.

103
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,600
54 plus 5 is 594.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,670
So this right here is 594.

105
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,610
And then to figure out what 15--
So we want to figure out

106
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,080
what 15 minus 594 is.

107
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,160
And this can sometimes be
confusing, but the way I

108
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,040
always process this in my head
is, I say that this is the

109
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:13,970
exact same thing as the negative
of 594 minus 15.

110
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,870
And if you don't believe
me, distribute out

111
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,920
this negative sign.

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,580
Negative 1 times 594
is negative 594.

113
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,970
Negative 1 times negative
15 is positive 15.

114
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,880
So these two statements
are equivalent.

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,160
This is much easier for my
brain to understand.

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,270
So what's 594 minus 15?

117
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,120
We can do this in our heads.

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,530
594 minus 14 would be 580,
and then 580 minus 1

119
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,820
more would be 579.

120
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,270
So that right there is 579, and
then we have this negative

121
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,900
sign sitting out there.

122
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,510
So the 100th term in our
sequence will be negative 579.

123
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,200

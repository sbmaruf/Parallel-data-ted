1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's get started
with some problems.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,620
Let's see.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:19,806
First problem: what
is 15% of 40?

5
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:22,610
The way I do percent problems
is I just convert the

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,630
percentage to a decimal and
then I multiply it times the

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,720
number that I'm trying to
get the percentage of.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,820
So 15% as a decimal is 0.15.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,360
You learned that from the
percent to decimal conversion

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,640
video, hopefully.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,550
And we just multiply
this times 40.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:47,990
So let's say 40 times 0.15.

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,510
5 times 0 is 0.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,100
5 times 4 is 20.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,620
Put a 0 there.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,660
And then 1 times 0 is 0.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,266
1 times 4 is 4.

18
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:02,720
And you get 6 0 0.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,490
Then you count the
decimal spots.

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,670
1, 2.

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,740
No decimals up there,
so you go 1, 2 and you

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,230
put the decimal there.

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:18,870
So 15% of 40 is equal to 0.15
times 40, which equals 6.00.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,480
Well, that's just the
same thing as 6.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,640
Let's do another problem.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,710
Hopefully, that didn't
confuse you too much.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,960
And I'm going to try to
confuse you this time just

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,050
in case you weren't properly
confused the last time.

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:47,860
What is 0.2% of-- let me
think of a number-- of 7.

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,060
So a lot of people's
inclinations would just

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,010
say, oh, 0.2%, that's
the same thing as 0.2.

32
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,950
And if that was your
inclination you would be wrong.

33
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,610
Because remember,
this isn't 0.2.

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,290
This is 0.2%.

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,760
So there's two ways of
thinking about this.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:10,350
You could say that this is
0.2/100, which is, if you

37
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,270
multiply the numerator and
denominator by 10, is the

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,830
same thing as 2/1,000.

39
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,260
Or you can just do the
technique where you

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,260
move the decimal space
over 2 to the left.

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,360
In which case, if you're
starting with 0.2 and you

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,620
move the decimal space 2
to the left, you go bam.

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,300
Whoops!

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,090
Bam, bam.

45
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,170
That's where the decimal goes.

46
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,370
So it's 0.002.

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,410
This is key.

48
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,370
0.2% is the same
thing as 0.002.

49
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,110
This can always trip you up and
I've made this careless mistake

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,890
all the time, so don't feel
bad if you ever do it.

51
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,460
But just always pay careful
attention if you see a

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,050
decimal and a percentage
at the same time.

53
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,400
So now that we've figured out
how to write this percentage

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,210
as a decimal we just have to
multiply it times the number

55
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,000
that we want to take
the percentage of.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,190
So we say 0.002 times 7.

57
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,490
Well, this is pretty
straightforward.

58
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,070
7 times 2 is 14.

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,710
And how many total numbers do
we have or how many total

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,830
digits do we have behind
the decimal point?

61
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,240
Let's see.

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,930
It's 1, 2, 3.

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,600
So we need 1, 2, 3 digits
behind the decimal point.

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:36,175
So 0.2% of 7 is equal to 0.014.

65
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,200
And you're probably thinking,
boy, that's a really,

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,360
really small number.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,545
And it makes sense because
0.2%, if you want to

68
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:46,860
think about it, that's
smaller than even 1%.

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,585
So that's even
smaller than 1/100.

70
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:52,450
And actually, if you think
about it, 0.2% is 1/500.

71
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,760
And if you do the math,
1/500 of 7 will turn

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,190
out to be this number.

73
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,500
And that's an important
thing to do.

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,240
It's always good to do a
reality check because when

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,560
you're doing these decimal and
these percent problems, it's

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
very easy to kind of lose a
factor of 10 here or there.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
Or gain a factor of 10.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,620
So always do a reality check to
see if your answer makes sense.

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,630
So now I'm going to
confuse you even further.

80
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:27,940
What if I were to ask you
4 is 20% of what number?

81
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,600

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,730
So a lot of people's
reflex might just be,

83
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,850
oh, let me take 20%.

84
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,360
It becomes 0.20.

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,850
And multiply it times 4.

86
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,570
And in that case, again,
you may be wrong.

87
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,080
Because think about it.

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,700
I'm not saying
what is 20% of 4?

89
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm saying that 20%
of some number is 4.

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,470
So now we're going to be doing
a little bit of algebra.

91
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,090
I bet you didn't expect that
in the percent module.

92
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,080
So let x equal the number.

93
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,760

94
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:14,630
And this problem says that
20% of x is equal to 4.

95
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,500
I think now it's in a form
that you might recognize.

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,240
So how do we write
20% as a decimal?

97
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,970
Well, that's just 0.20 or 0.2.

98
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,890
And we just multiply
it by x to get 4.

99
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,080
So 20%, that's the
same thing as 0.2.

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,450
It's the same thing as 0.20,
but that last trailing

101
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,720
0 doesn't mean much.

102
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,160
0.2 times x is equal to 4.

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
And now we have a level
one linear equation.

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,670
I bet you didn't
expect to see that.

105
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,540
So what do we do?

106
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,550
Well there's two
ways to view it.

107
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,820
You can just divide both
sides of this equation

108
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,700
by the coefficient on x.

109
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:54,010
So if you divide 0.2 here
and you divide by 0.2 here.

110
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,460
So you get x is equal
to 4 divided by 0.2.

111
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,350
So let's figure out what
4 divided by 0.2 is.

112
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,120
I hope I have enough space.

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,500
0.2 goes into 4-- I'm going
to put a decimal point here.

114
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300
And the way we do these
problems, we move the

115
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,310
decimal point here one
over to the right.

116
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,520
So we just get a 2 and then we
can move the decimal point

117
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,420
here one over to the right.

118
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,680
So this 0.2 goes into 4
the same number of times

119
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,012
that 2 goes into 40.

120
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,530
And this is easy.

121
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,670
2 goes into 40 how many times?

122
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,152
Well, 2 goes into 4 two
times and then 2 goes

123
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:32,980
into 0, zero times.

124
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,050
You could've done
that in your head.

125
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,530
2 into 40 is twenty times.

126
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,580
So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20.

127
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,570
So the answer is
4 is 20% of 20.

128
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,120

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
And does that make sense?

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

131
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,610
20% is exactly 1/5.

132
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,810
And 4 times 5 is 20.

133
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
That makes sense.

134
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,430
If you're still not sure
we can check the problem.

135
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,630
Let's take 20% of 20.

136
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:12,880
So 20% of 20 is equal
to 0.2 times 20.

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,182
And if you do the math
that also will equal 4.

138
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,410
So you made sure you
got the right answer.

139
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,490
Let's do another one like that.

140
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,000

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,810
I'm picking numbers randomly.

142
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:36,140
Let's say 3 is 9% of what?

143
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,440

144
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:52,320
Once again, let's let x equal
the number that 3 is 9% of.

145
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
You didn't have to
write all that.

146
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,980
Well, in that case we know that
0.09x-- 0.09, that's the same

147
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,430
thing as 9% of x--
is equal to 3.

148
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,770
Or that x is equal to
3 divided by 0.09.

149
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,440
Well, if we do the decimal
division, 0.09 goes into 3.

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,290
Let's put a decimal point here.

151
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,260
I don't know how many
0's I'm going to need.

152
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,220
So if I move this decimal over
to the right twice, then I'll

153
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,980
move this decimal over
to the right twice.

154
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,580
So 0.09 goes into 3 the
same number of times

155
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,960
that 9 goes into 300.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,070
So 9 goes into 30 three times.

157
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,820
3 times nine is 27.

158
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,050
I think I see a
pattern here already.

159
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,310
30, 3, 3 times 9 is 27.

160
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,010
You're going to keep getting
33-- the 3's are just

161
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,490
going to go on forever.

162
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,960
So it turns out that 3 is 9%
of-- you can either write it as

163
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,870
33.3 repeating or we all know
that 0.3 forever is the

164
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,310
same thing as 1/3.

165
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,380
So 3 is 9% of 33 and 1/3.

166
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,220
Either one of those would
be an acceptable answer.

167
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,700
And a lot of times when you're
doing percentages you're

168
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,885
actually just trying
to get a ballpark.

169
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,790
The precision might not always
be the most important thing,

170
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,060
but in this case we
will be precise.

171
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,390
And obviously, on tests
and things you need to

172
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,940
be precise as well.

173
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,020
Hopefully, I didn't go too
fast and you have a good

174
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,340
sense of percentage.

175
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,770
The important thing for these
type of problems is pay

176
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,740
attention to how the
problem is written.

177
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,480
If it says find 10% of 100.

178
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,050
That's easy.

179
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,010
You just convert 10% to a
decimal and multiply it by 100.

180
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,570
But if I were to ask you
100 is 10% of what?

181
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,340
You have to remember that
that's a different problem.

182
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,440
In which case, 100 is 10% of--
and if you did the math,

183
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,850
it would be 1,000.

184
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,730
I think I spoke very quickly on
this problem on this module, so

185
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,980
I hope you didn't
get too confused.

186
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,440
But I will record more.

187
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,991

99

Gay is bad for you.

100

- 'Cause...

101
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:09,645
I don't know.

102
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:11,663
- (Finebros) What do you think 
people's reactions were

103
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:14,928
when they watched these videos?
- Um, it depends for certain people.

104
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,609
- A lot of people were happy.

105
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:19,644
- Really good, positive things.
- Yeah, I hope not negative things.

106
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,499
- Some people must 
have been like, "Rock on!"

107
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:25,938
And some people were like, "Ew."

108
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,663
Some people are so anti-gay.

109
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,608
- You don't see that everyday.
It's okay though.

110
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:31,716
A boy can like a boy 
or a girl can like a girl.

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,410
- Most people would probably have 
a reaction like, "It's not natural!"

112
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:36,762
It's normal now.

113
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:39,547
- (Finebros) A lot of people were upset 
at these marriage proposals

114
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,619
BECAUSE it was a man proposing to a man

115
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,905
and a woman proposing to a woman.

116
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:45,575
- I don't get why anybody would be mad!

117
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,002
- That's just wrong.

118
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,973
Anyone should be able to marry anyone.

119
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:51,536
- You should feel happy 
that they're getting married.

120
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:55,302
- People that do not like gay-- 
I mean, they are good.

121
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,211
- That makes me mad.

122
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,938
- You can't tell 
another person who to marry!

123
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:02,294
What if you're a girl 
and your boyfriend proposes to you?

124
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,890
That's not different from a girl 
proposing to a girl.

125
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,988
- If you want to marry 
the same sex that's okay.

126
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:12,164
It's just like Macklemore said:
"I can't change you, even if I tried."

129
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,625
- (Finebros) Do you know 
what being gay means?

130
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:18,199
- No.

131
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:20,404
- A boy likes a boy 
and a girl likes a girl.

132
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,619
- (Finebros) It means that they 
like someone of the same gender.

133
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:27,209
- Does that mean they're a gate?
- (Finebros) No, not a gate.

134
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:29,462
- Or a Golden Gay Bridge?

135
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,743
I just don't know 
where the name comes from.

136
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:34,401
- (Finebros) The word actually comes 
from the word that means happy.

137
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:38,861
- If I got a box of microscopes, 
would I be gay?

138
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:42,169
- (Finebros) Well, because you're happy?
- Yeah.

139
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,593
- (Finebros) Why is it that some people 
like the opposite gender

140
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,638
while some people like the same gender?

141
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:47,525
- Hmm.

142
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:50,044
I don't know.

143
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:50,801
- I don't know.

144
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:54,291
- Well, it's the same.
My best friend's a boy, not a girl.

145
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:58,885
- You're hanging out with a guy 
for the rest of your life.

146
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:00,548
All you're gonna know is guy things.

147
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:03,554
If you go to a fancy restaurant, 
you're just gonna be burping the whole time.

148
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,249
- People that like the same gender

149
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:09,418
are depicted as abnormal, 
but they were born that way.

150
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,260
- Born that way.

151
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,225
- Just how they were born.

152
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:14,168
- I wasn't born that way.

153
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,505
- (Finebros) Well, do you think 
that people are born that way?

154
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,132
- (Finebros) Some people say 
that people choose to be gay

155
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,352
and that it's something 
that can be corrected or fixed.

156
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:24,422
- Yeah, it could be possible actually.

157
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:28,321
But if you really like that person, 
you should be with that person.

158
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:32,338
- That kind of stuff makes me sick.

159
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,264
You like what you like!

160
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:37,297
- You can't be all bossy to people.

161
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,328
Like, "(bossily) You can't do that!
You can't do that!

162
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,917
You need to do this.
No! No! No!"

163
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:46,546
It's okay for school and stuff like that--
vocabulary, spelling, and everything,

164
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,570
but when it's yourself
don't let people tell you what to do.

165
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,147
- (Finebros) What do you 
think about gay marriage?

166
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:52,884
- I don't care.

167
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,485
- I'm just new to the concept.

168
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,569
- The first time I ever heard 
about it I was like,

169
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,829
"Okay, that's kind of weird but...

170
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,176
well, people should be together 
if they like each other a lot.

171
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:03,078
- If one person should 
be able to do something,

172
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:04,712
then everybody else should be able to do it.

173
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,916
- That's awesome.

174
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,298
Some of our really good friends 
are gay and lesbian.

175
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:12,143
- You shouldn't have to be 
any different than regular marriage,

176
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:14,317
even though in our society it is.

177
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:16,013
- My friends talk about it all the time.

178
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,211
They use the word "gay" as something else.

179
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,912
You don't just say, 
"(cruelly) Hey, you're gay. Ha. Ha."

180
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,269
That's dumb.

181
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,155
Why would you be that mean to someone?

182
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:27,996
- (Finebros) So in the United States,
only 14 states are you allowed

183
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,346
to get married if you are gay-- only 14.

184
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,187
- That is just insane.

185
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,486
- Out of 50. 
That's outrageous.

186
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,222
- (sternly) I need to talk to Mr. President.

187
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,113
- You know what?

188
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,114
I feel bad for the people that live

189
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,944
in that state and like the same gender.

190
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,285
Mmm, it's not right.

191
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,109
- It kinda takes away 
from whole freedom thing.

192
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:50,333
- Love's a freedom 
and they're totally taking that away.

193
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:54,737
- It used to be illegal for a black person
to marry a white person.

194
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:57,126
I don't get why all this stuff has to be illegal.

195
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,908
- Slavery wasn't abolished 
until Abraham Lincoln.

196
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,952
Then women weren't even allowed to vote.

197
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,029
We've progressed a lot,
and there was bumps in the road,

198
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,349
but now we're at another bump.

199
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,189
- I think that you have 
to find a boy and a girl.

200
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,929
I mean, you can get married like that. 
But gay? You can't get married.

201
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,879
- (Finebros) But do you know 
why you don't like it?

202
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:15,947
- I don't know.

203
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:22,542
- Some people want to live in one state
and they want to get married.

204
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:24,916
They just ought to move to the other state.

205
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,928
But I'm afraid there's tornadoes.

206
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,683
I don't want to go there, 
but I have to because I want to marry

207
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,843
someone I like!
And that's not right.

208
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,360
- (Finebros) Well, in some places 
in the world you can

209
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,341
even be put in jail if you're gay.
- (put off) Wow!

210
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:41,747
- (Finebros) And even worse, 
in some places you even could be

211
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:44,905
sentenced to death just because 
you love the same gender.

212
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:48,277
(frustrated scream)

213
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:49,564
- I'm not going wherever that is.

214
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:52,414
- You can't just kill 
someone for what they like.

215
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,722
- I'm kind of ashamed 
that I live in this world!

216
00:08:54,725 --> 00:09:00,095
Why can't I live on that moon 
that supposedly has jellyfish on it?

217
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,275
- (Finebros) Why does it matter 
so much to other people

218
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,325
who you love and who you marry?
- Because gay is bad for you.

219
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:09,285
- I don't know.
For crazy, dumb, selfish stuff.

220
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:12,971
- I'm not really sure what's in their mind,
what they're thinking.

221
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,389
Well, I guess people 
consider it "not normal".

222
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,717
- Maybe their religion doesn't want that?

223
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:21,113
- Nobody really has a reason to hate gays.

224
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:24,479
It's not like-- 
there's no completely valid reason.

225
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,727
- (Finebros) A lot of people 
who are gay are afraid

226
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:28,593
to admit it and afraid to come out.

227
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,873
They're worried about their family 
rejecting them or losing their friends.

228
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,332
Why does something 
like that happen so often?

229
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:37,997
- Because they know 
people are mean about it

230
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:41,717
and they don't want to be bullied.

231
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,527
- 'Cause they're scared 
of what might happen.

232
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:47,391
- Some people, I guess, would think 
they're trying to hit on them.

233
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:49,185
That totally changes the perspective.

234
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,313
The thought might cross your mind of,

235
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:52,153
"Oh my god. 
What if they have a crush on me?"

236
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,280
It's the same thing if a guy says 
he has a crush on me.

237
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,327
And you say, "Oh, well, you know, 
I don't really like you

238
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,217
in that way but we can still be friends."

239
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:01,247
I mean, you don't just have to 
completely cast him out of your life.

240
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,890
You can't read minds,
you can't tell if someone likes you or not

241
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,865
so... yeah, just deal with it.

242
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:09,355
Deal with it.
(everyone laughs)

243
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:10,763
- (Finebros) So if someone was your friend

244
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:13,144
and they turned out to be gay
would you still be their friend?

245
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:13,619
- No.

246
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:14,898
- I would still be their friend

247
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,288
but I would just ask them a few questions.

248
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,680
- Well, I would 
have a different look on it,

249
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:21,338
but I think I'd still be 
friends with them.

250
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,818
- If it's your friend, 
then it's your friend.

251
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:24,497
- I'd love them more 
for being honest with me.

252
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:29,183
- They don't turn different.
They just turn out to love a boy.

253
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,458
- My best friend is gay,
and so he came out last year.

254
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,317
And I mean, seriously, 
we've been best friends since third grade.

255
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,748
- I would keep being your friend.

256
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:41,543
Even if you think it's weird, 
it doesn't really affect on how they act.

257
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,529
If you don't think about it, 
they sound like a perfectly normal kid.

258
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,384
- (Finebros) So now let's go over 
some of the reasons people say

259
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,530
they are against gay marriage.
- (wearily) Oh god.

260
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,773
- (Finebros) Some have said 
they're against it

261
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,733
because they say it's not natural,

262
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:55,478
because a man and a woman,
they can have children.

263
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:57,574
Is that a valid reason 
to be against gay marriage?

264
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:58,791
- No!
- Nope.

265
00:10:58,788 --> 00:10:59,588
- Adopt!

266
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,179
- People are mean to each other sometimes.

267
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,788
Maybe that's just their opinion.

268
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,866
- That's no reason at all.

269
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:08,801
Some people want to have kids.
Some people don't want to have kids.

270
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,408
So it doesn't really affect on it.

271
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,173
- If it's happening 
and it's not a chemical,

272
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,517
it is natural. (laughs)

273
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:17,397
- (Finebros) Another major reason 
that it's very controversial

274
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:21,351
is that every major religion
has something in their books

275
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:24,971
that could be interpreted 
as being against people who are gay.

276
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,100
What are your thoughts about people
who are against it for religious beliefs?

277
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,550
- I mean, I'm a Christian 
and I don't think it's wrong.

278
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,129
- It's, like, the 21st century.
- Things have changed.

279
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:38,113
- If they said that, like,
"God told me blah, blah, blah,"

280
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,934
I'd be like, "(mumbling) Um, that's nice. 
I'm gonna leave you now."

281
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:45,773
- Religion shouldn't be something 
that determines who you're friends with.

282
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,081
- A lot of people have that logic.

283
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,230
My religion says so, so I have to do it.

284
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,443
When you're saying that 
someone's gay and that's wrong,

285
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,704
you're using your religion 
against someone else.

286
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:56,089
That would be so wrong.

287
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,360
- (Finebros) Some states 
don't let you get married

288
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,912
but they'll give gay couples the same rights

289
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,646
as someone who is married. 
Is that enough?

290
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:07,126
I feel like they should be able 
to get married if they want to

291
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,200
but it's better than nothing.

292
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,740
- It's not good because it's like, 
"Oh, you can have every single right.

293
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,849
You just can't get married."
That's the one thing they want.

294
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:15,252
- I sort of get what they're saying about,

295
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:18,142
"Oh. What are they complaining about?
They still have the same rights."

296
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,160
But they're still deprived of one thing

297
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,060
which is sort of a major milestone
in somebody's life.

298
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,200
- You could have your friend that's not gay.

299
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,415
He'll be married.

300
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:31,677
But then you'll be with your partner, 
but you won't be married.

301
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,909
It doesn't make sense.

302
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:36,283
- Before Martin Luther King stood up,

303
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,999
it's like white people 
were like kings and queens!

304
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,559
Then black people 
were like tiny, little servants.

305
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:45,128
They're treating-- 
the people who get married like,

306
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,785
"We're the people who own a mansion."

307
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:50,715
And then the other people... 
people in small cottages.

308
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:53,989
If a person wants to do 
something and they can't,

309
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,010
that means something 
in your life is impossible,

310
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,050
like you have a brick wall all around you.

311
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:05,025
And you want to go to that tree,
and you can't pass over that wall.

312
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:07,087
Would you want to move out?

313
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,095
Yeah.

314
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:10,023
But you can't.
It's like you're trapped.

315
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,648
- (Finebros) And what would 
you want to say to the people

316
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,602
out there that believe
gay marriage shouldn't be allowed?

317
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:14,928
- Get a hobby.

318
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,170
- Cry me a river, 
build me a bridge, and get over it.

319
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,512
- Just get a whole new idea 
about it because it's fine.

320
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:20,714
There's nothing wrong with it.

321
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:25,759
- If only gay people 
could marry, you'd be really sad.

322
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:28,522
So why shouldn't they be able to marry?

323
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:30,402
- It's not okay to hate gay people.

324
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,001
You can feel that way.

325
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:33,126
Don't bring it into the law.

326
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,180
- Think of God.

327
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:36,564
He loves everybody 
and he can't hate anything.

328
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:39,834
- You guys are basic and nobody likes you.
No, I'm kidding.

329
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,831
If they've never been around gay people

330
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,671
and they're just doing what the Bible says
or what their parents say,

331
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,300
you're judging that person 
without actually meeting them.

332
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,931
- You need to realize 
you're just a little speck.

333
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,003
No one cares what you think.

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,160
- I wouldn't exactly say, 
"You suck. Get out of my life.,"

335
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:59,505
but I'd say that
in the nicest words possible.

336
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,720
- (Finebros) And what about people
who might be watching

337
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:04,993
that are either in a bad situation 
and they are openly gay

338
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:07,299
or they've not come out 
and are too afraid to come out?

339
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:08,545
- All right.

340
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,272
I think this is a quote.

341
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,295
"Never think about 
what someone says about you.

342
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,017
Only think about what you think of yourself."

343
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:18,507
- If someone doesn't accept you, 
then they obviously aren't your friends.

344
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:21,424
- I'm totally supporting you guys.
You guys are awesome.

345
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,727
- I'm your friend!

346
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,306
- (Finebros laughs)
- Air hug!

347
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,679
- There are people who are supportive 
of your sexual orientation.

348
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:31,708
It does get better.

349
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:35,147
- You always hear, 
"Your real self shines through."

350
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:38,381
Maybe eventually someday 
the whole thing will be over

351
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:40,624
and a nice gay couple can be together.

352
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:44,159
Maybe someday people 
won't have to worry about it

353
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,540
and you might feel like 
you've done an actual good thing.

354
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:49,303
- (Finebros) Do you think that 
by the time you have grown up

355
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:52,262
that gay marriage will be legal everywhere?
- Yes.

356
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:53,503
- I hope.
- It should be.

357
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,660
- No! No! No!

358
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,748
- I'm not sure.
People are selfish.

359
00:14:56,749 --> 00:15:02,989
I think the world everywhere-- 
like all planets-- just legalize it.

360
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,086
- (Finebros) Why is equal rights, 
as a concept for all people,

361
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:09,295
something so important?
- Because human beings are human beings

362
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:11,255
and they should all be treated the same.

363
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:14,424
- So it's fair for everyone 
and people don't get upset or sad.

364
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:18,838
- Remember that time where there 
were bathrooms for black people

365
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,623
and bathrooms for white people?

366
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,223
This is the same thing.

367
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:25,876
No one has a greater power 
than you except, you know,

368
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:27,862
the bureaucracy and everything. (laughs)

369
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:31,922
- It's so funny how people who, 
let's say, are racist.

370
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:34,268
And then you say to them, 
"We should be different because my eyes

371
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,275
are blue and your eyes are brown."

372
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:38,345
They'd probably be like, 
"Oh what? No, that's absurd!"

373
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:39,844
It's the same thing!

374
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:42,568
I mean, unless you guys want to hear 
me go on and on about this,

375
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,340
I suggest you just cut it right now.

376
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:47,575
- This is a really big situation 
of what people

377
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:50,516
think and what people are hating.

378
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,996
Even though that's not my problem,
I will still fight for it if I can.

379
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:57,041
(silence)

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,500
We're told that Jared is twice
the age of his brother, Peter.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,470
So Jared is twice the age
of his brother, Peter.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,370
Peter is 4 years old.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,210

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,760
And Jared is twice the
age of his brother, Peter.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,260
So Jared is twice
Peter's age of 4.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,550
And then they tell us, Talia's
age is 3 times Jared's age.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,432
How old are Talia and Jared?

10
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:34,390
So Talia's age is 3
times Jared's age.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,560
So let's write this down.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,430
We have Peter is 4 years old.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:45,050
So Peter's age,
he's 4 years old.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,090
Jared is twice the age
of his brother, Peter.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,475
Let me do that in yellow.

16
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:54,225
That's not yellow.

17
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:58,390

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,454
Jared is twice the
age of his brother.

19
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:09,495
Twice is the same thing as 2
times the age of his brother.

20
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,620
You could say Jared is
twice the age of his brother

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,320
or Jared is 2 times
the age of his brother.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,670
Well, his brother is 4.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,610
They told us that
right over there.

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,485
So Jared is going to
be 2 times 4 years old.

25
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:24,440

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,280
And if you know your
multiplication tables,

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,770
you know that's the
same thing as 8.

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,466
2 times 4 is 8.

29
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,910
4 times 2 is 8.

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,710
Or you know this is the
same thing as Peter's age

31
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,380
twice, which is the
same thing as 4 plus 4.

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,060
That would also get you 8.

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,370
So Jared's age is equal to 8.

34
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,030
And then, finally, they
say Talia's age-- so

35
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,120
let me write Talia
right over here.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,060
Talia's age and they tell
it to us right over here.

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,500
It's 3 times Jared's age.

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,105
So Talia's age is 3
times Jared's age.

39
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:01,980
Well, we were able to
figure out Jared's age.

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,800
It is 8.

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,465
It is 3 times Jared's age.

42
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:08,090
If you know your
multiplication tables,

43
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,810
this should maybe
jump out at you.

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,700
And your multiplication tables
really are one of those things

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,192
in mathematics that you should
really just know back and forth

46
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,150
just because it will make
the rest of your life

47
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,090
very, very, very simple.

48
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,620
Or you could view 3 times 8
as literally 8 three times.

49
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,810
So it's 8 plus 8 plus 8.

50
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,250
8 plus 8 is 16, 16 plus 8 is 24.

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,890
So 3 times 8 is 24.

52
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,450
So Peter is 4, Jared
is 8, and Talia is 24.

53
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,498

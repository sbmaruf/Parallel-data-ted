1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:08,060
We're asked to compare
156.378 to 156.348.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,550
So I assume that they're asking
us which of these is greater.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,430
And so let's rewrite
these numbers.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:23,960
156.378, and we want to
compare that to 156.348.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,650
And it might already
be obvious to you

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,733
which of these is greater.

8
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,710
But I'll work through
it step-by-step, just

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,330
in case it's not.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,629
So let's first go to
the hundreds place.

11
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:34,420
And you could view this
as, to some degree,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,760
the most significant
place, because this

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,690
is where they have the largest--
the 1 in the hundreds place

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,019
represents a lot more than
a 1 in the tens place or a 1

15
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:43,810
in the six's place.

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,010
A 1 in the hundreds
place represents 100.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,730
It's this many hundreds.

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,570
But we have the same number of
hundreds in both situations.

19
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,140
We have 1 hundred and
we have 1 hundred.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,740
Let's go to the tens place.

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,040
We have 5 tens
here, which is 50.

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,610
And we have 50 right over here.

23
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,380
So, so far they're
equal, so far,

24
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,670
if you just look at the
hundreds and the tens place.

25
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,880
Let's go the ones place.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,240
We have a 6 here in
the ones place, 6 ones,

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,720
which is really just 6.

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,140
And you also have 6 ones.

29
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,460
So, so far, they're equal again.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,850
Let's go to the tenths
place-- 3 tenths, 3 tenths.

31
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,280
Let's go to the
hundredths place.

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,090
So we're going into
smaller and smaller places.

33
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,400
So then you have
the 7 hundredths.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,100
And now we have 4
hundredths here.

35
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,399
So this has less hundredths
than this does over here.

36
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,690
And if we go to the thousandths
place, these are equal.

37
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,773
But it doesn't matter,
even if these were unequal.

38
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:39,110
It doesn't matter, even if this
one was larger than this one,

39
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,150
because in the more
significant place,

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,770
this number was larger
than this number.

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,120
So 7 is greater than 4.

42
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,550
We have 7 hundredths here.

43
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,080
We have 4 hundredths here.

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,860
So we get this number is greater
than this number down here.

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:02,950
Or 156.378 is
greater than 156.348.

46
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,167
And in particular, it's because
of the hundredths place.

47
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:07,667

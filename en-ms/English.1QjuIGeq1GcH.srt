1
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:16,294
There's something going on with you, isn't there?

2
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:18,028
You're not sleeping?

3
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,007
Don't even think about lying to me.

4
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:28,078
There's nothing going on.

5
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:34,845
I want to live here with dad, you and san.

6
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:37,039
what...?

7
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,573
Why?

8
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:42,416
And what about Young Master JunPyo,school and everything?

9
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:47,566
Didn't I say it before? I have nothing to do with Goo JunPyo

10
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:52,301
Also, after putting up with so much humiliation, you still regret it?

11
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:52,097
Oh, gee!

12
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:59,914
So in this small rural town, selling fish, crabs and webfoot octopus, smelling like fish, that's how you want to live?

13
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:05,352
What's wrong with that?

14
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:08,046
Oh my gosh...

15
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:23,298
We're done for ! We're finished ! What hope do we have to live for now ?

16
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:25,091
Mom..

17
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:46,486
Forget it!

18
00:01:46,486 --> 00:02:04,633
Yi Jung sunbae....

19
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:08,445
There's still no news from JanDi?

20
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:12,278
No. I don't know what she's thinking.

21
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:19,017
She hasn't called. She just said she went to a fishing village but never said where it is.

22
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:23,928
She must be doing ok. It's Geum Jandi we're talking about.

23
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:28,032
You seem to know my friends better than I do.

24
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,651
Like I said before,

25
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:36,589
I have some knowledge when it comes to girls

26
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,781
How is JunPyo sunbae doing?

27
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:45,757
He's a mess.

28
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:48,805
GaEul...

29
00:02:48,805 --> 00:03:04,295
Don't you think it's time we start talking about us?

30
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,932
GaEul

31
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:10,624
I...I'll go first.

32
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:19,247
You don't have to feel burdened because of me.I already know how you feel.

33
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:23,518
So, from now on, I won't look for you anymore.

34
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:24,518
GaEul!

35
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:38,838
EunJae teacher said before, that because she did everything that was within her power, that she has no regrets.

36
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,606
Thank you.

37
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:46,474
For giving me the chance to do everything I could

38
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:49,702
If I hear from Jandi, I will inform you.

39
00:03:49,702 --> 00:05:02,135
Bye.

40
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,033
What can we do?

41
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:12,392
Mister, I am so afraid that our Jun-Pyo might really become broken. I'm really afraid.

42
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,095
Miss.. you can't be like this also..

43
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,859
No.

44
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,262
This time...

45
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:30,598
I have a really bad feeling about this.

46
00:05:30,598 --> 00:06:51,631
Miss?

47
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:55,884
Dad.... Dad...

48
00:06:55,884 --> 00:07:22,073
DAD!!!!

49
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:25,582
How could you do this?

50
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:29,796
Can't you see it's already hard without you screaming about it?

51
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:36,524
Mom.... no, I don't even want to call you mom anymore.

52
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:43,334
how..how could a person..how could a person do something like that?!?

53
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,324
What exactly are you talking about??

54
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:50,805
How could you say that dad was dead when he's still alive?!

55
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,925
- You... - How did I know?

56
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,467
You're wondering about that at a time like this?

57
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,093
I'm asking you.

58
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:01,692
Leaving Dad buried like that, did you intend to deceive me forever?!

59
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:07,125
Why did you do that?! WHY?!

60
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,607
This is what your father would have wanted

61
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:13,847
W... W... What?

62
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:22,119
I said I will take care of everything, but your dad suddenly collapsed. He isn't different from a living corpse.

63
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:29,956
The head of the famous ShinHwa Group, I couldn't allow the last memories of him to become like that.

64
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:33,927
My pride wouldn't allow it.

65
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:38,092
Pride...Now...

66
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:49,096
Are you saying that you lied to the world and even to your childrenthat my living father was dead because of your pride?

67
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:55,138
It was for your dad.

68
00:08:55,138 --> 00:09:00,989
What is this about?

69
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:03,863
JunPyo....

70
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:07,135
I'll explain everything. I...

71
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:40,722
I'm asking what does it mean?

72
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:44,006
When dad is not around what you have to do?

73
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:48,048
I have to take care of mother, sister, and Shinhwa group!

74
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:52,683
Goo Junpyo, can you promise me that as a man to man?

75
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,723
Yes, sir!

76
00:09:54,723 --> 00:10:05,141
Your father tried his hardest till the very end for this group, which you can throw away any minute.

77
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:16,948
Are you thinking of abandoning him as well?

78
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,038
I'm sorry, young master.

79
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:59,006
i am really sorry.

80
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:07,156
This time, it was me who realized that you and I were from two different worlds.

81
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:11,741
As much as you try to deny it, you are still Shinhwa Group's Goo JunPyo.

82
00:11:11,741 --> 00:12:30,904
I haven't once forgotten that

83
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:34,127
I have come to the fish market today.Everyone look at the fresh fish here.

84
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,898
The stall is full of fish.

85
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:41,037
- Look at this octopus.<Br>- $10!

86
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:43,344
- It seems this is the season for octopus.- $10!

87
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:49,882
Sure! It's drop-dead delicious! I'll give it to you for cheap, so buy some.

88
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:56,421
You hear that? Why don't you set today's dinner table with this webfoot octopus in season?

89
00:12:56,421 --> 00:13:15,364
This is the Saeuh island.I'm reporter Joh Boram.

90
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:19,423
I'm going to see dad. Will you go with me?

91
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,451
I'm not going.

92
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:37,968
Junpyo...

93
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:41,261
Junpyo

94
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:47,129
Come talk with Mom.

95
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:56,482
Mom ?

96
00:13:56,482 --> 00:14:09,918
Do you really think that you were even once my mom?

97
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:38,748
Why don't you quit with the act of being a mother when it doesn't suit you, Chairwoman Kang.

98
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:39,845
i have no interest.

99
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,092
What? If you're going to go, go by yourself.

100
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,244
Goo Junpyo

101
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:55,832
JunPyo, are you serious? Don't be like this. Go and see her once.

102
00:14:55,832 --> 00:15:03,851
I said I'm not interested!

103
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,541
I'll ask you one more time.

104
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,863
Are you sure?

105
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:14,144
If you miss her so much, you should go.

106
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:50,349
Then I'm going first. Whether you go or not, you do whatever you want.

107
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,633
When times are like this, don't you need Geum Jan Di the most?

108
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:59,063
What can I do by bringing her back here?

109
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:06,519
There is nothing that I can promise her....promising her that I'd always make her laugh,

110
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,807
...that I'd always make her happy so just trust in me I've lost the confidence to keep those kinds of promises.

111
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:11,788
Jun Pyo.

112
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:15,778
The fact that I am the son of that kind of person...

113
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,898
...the fact that I am a member of that kind of family...

114
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:25,703
...even I hate it so much...how do you think she feels?

115
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:29,926
With all that she's had to endure already, I'm sure she really hates it.

116
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:31,994
It's Geum JanDi, so the situation can be different.

117
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:35,775
That's even more reason not to.

118
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:39,075
Because it's the woman that I love.

119
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:53,583
That's why it's not going to happen even more now.

120
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,004
It would have been nice if we sold the rest of that

121
00:16:57,004 --> 00:17:07,697
Mom, I'm hungry! Oh, I'm sorry, San. I will have it ready soon.

122
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:09,532
What's going on?

123
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:14,228
What's going on? That's what we want to ask you.

124
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:19,636
There's a limit to your thinking what dumb country folk we are! What kind of scam are you trying to pull?

125
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,144
A scam?

126
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:22,915
You said you were the future daughter-in-law of ShinHwa Group!

127
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:26,326
My daughter says that there is someone else who is the future daughter-in-law.

128
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:31,002
See this? This lady is the heiress to a group much bigger than ShinHwa!

129
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:34,189
The fact that they were going to get married was even on the news!

130
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:36,158
That's old news.

131
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:44,139
What? So you mean you're really the future daughter-in-law of ShinHwa?

132
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:45,601
Well, that's not quite it either.

133
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:48,771
We don't care! Just give us back the money that you borrowed right now!!

134
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,773
What? Right now?

135
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:53,809
Yes! You never know...you just might run away in the middle of the night tonight!

136
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:54,806
That's right!

137
00:17:54,806 --> 00:18:00,616
Look at what you've already just sat around and received! There's no difference between that and scamming us!

138
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:04,252
Pay us even the interest right now!!!

139
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:18,062
Why all of a sudden.....

140
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:22,486
I'll pay it.

141
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:23,084
Sunbae..

142
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:26,979
Oh... that... that... master is...

143
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:43,391
That money.......I'll repay it.

144
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:46,156
What should we do?

145
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:50,568
Did you see that, see that?

146
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:54,007
I guess it was true that she had a rich future son-in-law!

147
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,305
So is he the heir of ShinHwa Group?

148
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:00,243
Oh, just look at his face!He had a sense of nobility flowing out of him!

149
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:03,613
Oh, my...I've never seen such a handsome Young Master..

150
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:14,608
I envy them.

151
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:36,857
I'm not going to die alone.I'm not going to die alone!

152
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:40,819
How did you know that I was here?

153
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:45,416
I heard it....

154
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:50,023
...the emergency bell...

155
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:58,803
I tossed and turned every night afraid that I wouldn't be able to hear it...

156
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:02,731
How can this happen?

157
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:10,568
How can a person do such a thing?

158
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:25,075
I...have received so much from you, Sunbae...

159
00:20:25,075 --> 00:21:13,383
But you have given me more...

160
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:16,606
How is Grandpa doing?

161
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:24,046
The usual...attending to work...probably will continue until he collapses again...

162
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:43,495
That is so like him....

163
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:46,046
Grandpa gave me this.

164
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:50,844
It was what my Grandma gave my mother.

165
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,744
Sunbae.

166
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,286
I don't know when I started to feel like this.

167
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:58,785
but...

168
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:21,006
I cannot live without you.

169
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:30,384
I cannot accept this.

170
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:32,422
Jandi...

171
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:37,995
I told myself I can forget it....

172
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:42,802
I thought I had forgotten it all.

173
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:46,833
However

174
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:56,524
However...

175
00:22:56,524 --> 00:23:02,106
I can't seem to be able to throw this away.

176
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:06,999
I just can't seem to let it go....

177
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:16,041
I can't separate Goo JunPyo from me.

178
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:20,047
I'm sorry.

179
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:24,606
I'm sorry sunbae.

180
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:31,892
It's ok.

181
00:23:31,892 --> 00:24:04,956
It's ok.

182
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:12,122
Jandi...I can't give her up.

183
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:15,719
Even though I always make things hard for her.

184
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:20,168
I've sometimes thought it might be better to let her go to you.

185
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,138
no

186
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:27,492
If I had to give Jandi to another guy

187
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:33,043
I don't even want to think about it, but if I have to,

188
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:37,827
I thought you should the one.

189
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:41,036
It can't be anyone else but you, Jihoo

190
00:24:41,036 --> 00:25:26,275
I've thought about that.

191
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,982
I won't die alone.

192
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:31,812
I will see to ShinHwa's end!

193
00:25:31,812 --> 00:25:54,368
I won't go down alone.

194
00:25:54,368 --> 00:26:14,767
NO!

195
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:17,057
Jun Pyo.

196
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,398
JunPyo!

197
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:19,094
JunPyo!

198
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,376
JunPyo!

199
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:23,044
Yah, Goo JunPyo.

200
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:24,328
Wake up.

201
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:30,723
Goo JunPyo!

202
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:36,057
They brought on their own misfortunes.

203
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:38,904
This isn't your fault.

204
00:26:38,904 --> 00:26:40,028
This isn't your fault.

205
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:40,981
Goo JunPyo!

206
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:44,573
Wake up!

207
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:46,532
Hello?

208
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:49,458
My friend is dying.

209
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:53,376
I said my friend is dying!

210
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,144
JunPyo...

211
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:56,712
Jun Pyo!

212
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:58,366
Wake up.

213
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,071
Yah!!

214
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:14,147
Wake Up!!

215
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:21,054
Breaking news. Tonight at 8 p.m., in a coastal town, the heir to ShinHwa Group, Goo JunPyo, was...

216
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:23,548
...was the victim of an assault and...

217
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:31,985
...has sent shock throughout. The assailant who was caught at the scene said he was done wrong by ShinHwa Group

218
00:27:31,985 --> 00:28:11,621
and did it as an act of revenge on hostile takeover.

219
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:13,494
Are you satisfied? Is this what you wanted?

220
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:18,013
is this really what you wanted?

221
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:20,756
Miss, please calm down.

222
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:29,664
You said in the end, it was all for JunPyo. That you were handing all ShinHwa Group's assets to JunPyo.

223
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:37,579
Look...look at what your so-called future happiness has done to your son.

224
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:52,026
Mother, do you have a single idea as to what your son likes to eat, what he likes, what he wants to become?

225
00:28:52,026 --> 00:28:53,827
The surgery went well.

226
00:28:53,827 --> 00:29:01,082
The critical part is over.

227
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:04,433
That's good.

228
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,627
Let's Go.

229
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:09,696
What did you say?

230
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:12,074
There's an urgent meeting in Hong Kong.

231
00:29:12,074 --> 00:29:17,003
Was it not enough with just Dad?

232
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:22,077
Answer me what is more important to you..ShinHwa or JunPyo.

233
00:29:22,077 --> 00:31:10,157
Answer me!

234
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:13,082
JunPyo

235
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:19,587
...he loves rolled up egg and ramen..

236
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:25,699
He especially loves eating fish cakes from street vendors.

237
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:32,256
He can eat 20 at one sitting.

238
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:37,977
He likes packing lunch and going on a picnic...

239
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:41,086
With the telescope that his parents bought him....

240
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:53,736
...he also loves to star gaze.

241
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:56,916
Don't worry...

242
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,875
Goo JunPyo

243
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:34,193
He's gonna be okay.

244
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:35,089
JunPyo... JunPyo..

245
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:38,398
Are you okay?... JunPyo..

246
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:39,365
JunPyo

247
00:32:39,365 --> 00:33:16,004
JunPyo, it's your sister...

248
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,325
JunPyo got transferred to a room.

249
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:20,098
Why don't you go?

250
00:33:20,098 --> 00:34:21,739
If he knows you're next to him, he'll wake up soon.

251
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:48,357
Stop here for a minute.

252
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:54,034
Mom, do you have any idea what your son likes to eat,

253
00:34:54,034 --> 00:35:01,033
what he likes to do,what he wants to do?

254
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:03,712
JunPyo....

255
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:10,927
...he loves rolled up egg and ramen...

256
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:17,085
He especially likes eating fish cakes from street vendors...

257
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:26,164
He can eat 20 at one sitting.

258
00:35:26,164 --> 00:36:36,739
Move on.

259
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:41,681
I don't know when I started to feel this way.But...

260
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:44,055
I cannot live without you.

261
00:36:44,055 --> 00:36:50,689
JunPyo.. JunPyo

262
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:54,045
I told you so, didn't I?

263
00:36:54,045 --> 00:37:40,348
If not you, no one else...

264
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:56,178
Grandfather

265
00:37:56,178 --> 00:38:01,069
Jihoo...

266
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:04,119
Grandfather

267
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:39,358
Ok..ok

268
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:45,837
Say it. Aside from Shinhwa and being a plutocrat...

269
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:53,569
Have you ever seen me... as just a normal guy?

270
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:57,121
No

271
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:02,189
No matter how much you struggle, you're still Shinhwa Group's Goo Jun Pyo.

272
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:17,087
I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.

273
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:20,344
Goo JunPyo

274
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:26,428
Can you hear me?

275
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:33,205
I lied to you again.

276
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,843
To me, you

277
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:40,014
no matter what, are Goo JunPyo.

278
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:47,032
Goo JunPyo...the idiot who likes this Geum Jandi

279
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:54,173
who's not cute, has no money...no status...

280
00:39:54,173 --> 00:39:59,839
So wake up. Wake up.

281
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,632
wake up Goo junPyo

282
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:35,626
Goo JunPyo

283
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:36,633
Hubby..

284
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,303
Oh, Honey! Everything's okay, right?

285
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,019
You're healthy, right?

286
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:44,274
Us...we're home!

287
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:50,464
It's all thanks to you...you and all your hard work on that boat!

288
00:40:50,464 --> 00:40:52,789
The landlord..because they felt bad about what happened before....

289
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:55,027
...rented it back to us for cheap!

290
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,021
Dad! Once I become a pro gamer...

291
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,039
...you don't have to be on the boat so hurry and come home!

292
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,727
Daddy, daddy, daddy...we're okay so don't worry about us and just take care of your health, okay?

293
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:06,763
I understand honey.

294
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:25,039
Come home soon!

295
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,383
SunBae

296
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:54,178
JunPyo woke up.

297
00:41:54,178 --> 00:42:03,786
Oh JanDi..you came

298
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:06,223
You just woke up and you look perfectly fine!

299
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,875
It definitely isn't like any human's recovery!

300
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:25,201
Yo..my bro..welcome back.

301
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:28,658
Thank you

302
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:29,446
For what?

303
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,567
For being alive.

304
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:36,913
Did you really think that this Goo JunPyo would leave this life like that?

305
00:42:36,913 --> 00:42:38,322
It is definitely JunPyo.

306
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:42,826
Look at him, he's saying it was an unnatural death.

307
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,529
JanDi...why are you just standing there?

308
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,864
Come here. You were really worried, weren't you?

309
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:54,128
All the tests came back normal.

310
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:56,874
Thank Goodness... Goo JunPyo.

311
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:03,058
But who is that dorky-looking girl?

312
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:04,715
JunPyo.

313
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,771
You don't remember Geum Jan Di?

314
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:08,452
Don't joke around.

315
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,631
Geum JanDi

316
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:13,031
What's that?

317
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:16,091
Goo Junpyo

318
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:19,963
JunPyo, then do you remember your friends?

319
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:23,934
Are you joking?

320
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,011
Tell me my name.

321
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:27,104
So Yi Jung

322
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,173
Then me... do you remember me?

323
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,789
psh... Song WooBin.

324
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:44,239
Do you really not know who Geum Jandi is?

325
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,514
Is she someone I should know?

326
00:43:48,514 --> 00:44:15,525
Ji Hoo, is she your girl?

327
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:18,346
It's a partial memory loss.

328
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:25,529
For the patient, anything really stressful before the accident, he's forgotten.

329
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,345
But how is it possible that he can't remember just one person?

330
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:34,171
It's possible that memories regarding her are too painful or just too important..

331
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,706
so if he concentrates on it too much,

332
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:40,171
it could be erased selectively.

333
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:43,812
Then...when might his memories come back?

334
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:45,982
Who knows..?

335
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:49,458
Usually it's about six months...but...

336
00:44:49,458 --> 00:45:19,159
...there are cases where it doesn't come back ever.

337
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:21,118
Goo JunPyo..Hello

338
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,955
The weather's totally awesome, isn't it?

339
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:24,454
You want to go for a walk?

340
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,944
You

341
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:30,164
Who do you think you are that you can come in anytime when you please?

342
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:31,361
Hm?

343
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,029
Are you interested in me or something?

344
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,398
Hm?

345
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:38,934
Aren't you supposed to be Ji Hoo's woman?!

346
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:43,323
Yah! I'm not anyone's girl!

347
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:48,272
Well...more than JiHoo sunbae's, I'm more...your...

348
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:50,271
Get lost.

349
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:52,248
Are you hard of hearing or something?

350
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:55,835
I said get out! Girls like you bring me bad luck!

351
00:45:55,835 --> 00:46:00,433
Goo JunPyo

352
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:57,981
Can you go out? I want to rest.

353
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,178
Why aren't you coming out!

354
00:46:59,178 --> 00:47:03,374
Come out! I said come out!!

355
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:15,822
I said come out!!

356
00:47:15,822 --> 00:47:18,033
Unnie...here you go!

357
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:28,597
So don't cry anymore, okay?

358
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:33,899
You got to hit the vending machine only then it works.

359
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:37,034
Thank you

360
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:39,359
It seems like you've been admitted at this hospital for a while...

361
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,471
What's your name? Yumi...Jang Yumi. A junior at Korea High.

362
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:47,326
I'm Geum JanDi

363
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:48,071
ShinHwa High, Senior.

364
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:49,703
You go to ShinHwa High?

365
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:52,276
Oh, that's just so great!

366
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:56,461
But who are you here to visit?

367
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:59,097
A friend..,OH, I see..

368
00:47:59,097 --> 00:48:07,492
I broke my leg while skiing...

369
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:17,785
Wanna sit here?

370
00:48:17,785 --> 00:48:22,095
Yumi...you have such a vibrant personality..

371
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:28,598
It's just that I get annoyed with people who are at hospitals who are sad or high strung...

372
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:32,831
I don't like that.

373
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:36,958
So how should one be towards people like that?

374
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:41,555
For people how have been admitted for a long time and they're a little high strung and sensitive...

375
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:44,272
Just naturally....

376
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:50,765
Naturally?

377
00:48:50,765 --> 00:49:01,122
You over there! Are you ok?

378
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:05,701
Oppa...your condition looks pretty bad..you really shouldn't walk around like that.

379
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:06,686
Oppa?

380
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:08,492
You want to ride a wheelchair?

381
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,238
Don't concern yourself.

382
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,537
Then do you do want to borrow my crutches?

383
00:49:12,537 --> 00:49:16,064
Oppa, do you know how to use crutches?

384
00:49:16,064 --> 00:49:19,059
Hey, you little brat...don't act like we know each other and just go away.

385
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:21,927
Oppa, your personality is pretty bad, isn't it?

386
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,915
I'm not a little brat. I'm Yumi, Jang Yumi.

387
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:25,894
What?

388
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:31,933
You're the oppa that's in that VIP room, aren't you? I don't know what great person you are... but a patient is just another patient.

389
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:37,197
Oh, wait..not quite. At this hospital, Yumi is a sunbae!

390
00:49:37,197 --> 00:49:39,343
If you don't want to break the remaining leg...

391
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,657
..I'd suggest you lean on me.

392
00:49:42,657 --> 00:49:49,371
No, Yumi! Your leg is injured. Let me help. Why don't you lean on me.

393
00:49:49,371 --> 00:50:09,282
You still haven't left?

394
00:50:09,282 --> 00:50:27,673
Unni, see you next time!

395
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:30,651
So how about shocking him with something...or...

396
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:35,945
...recreating some important event in the past?

397
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,751
Such as?

398
00:50:37,751 --> 00:51:05,733
Of all the incidents with Geum JanDi, what was the event that had the most impact?

399
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:10,444
Goo JunPyo

400
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:20,449
What's with this girl?

401
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:28,982
What the hell are you trying to do?!

402
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:33,919
If you come back to your senses, call me.

403
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:35,999
What?

404
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:42,696
Are you some kind of crazy girl?

405
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:43,872
What kind of woman are you?

406
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:44,995
JunPyo

407
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:47,111
Don't you remember anything?

408
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:50,307
What the hell am I supposed to remember!?

409
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:59,624
What kind of bad luck is this with this bum-like chick...

410
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:00,381
Has it been too long ago?

411
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:03,124
No. I think this incident was too weak.

412
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:05,003
Next time, let's try something stronger.

413
00:52:05,003 --> 00:52:26,601
Stronger?

414
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:35,751
Didn't I tell you I was at the limits of my patience?

415
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:39,095
Yah! Who the hell do you think you're messing with?

416
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:43,388
Just because you're Ji Hoo's girlfriend, doesn't mean I'm going to hold back!

417
00:52:43,388 --> 00:52:46,154
Goo JunPyo.

418
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:48,555
I'm warning you. I'm not going to go soft on you!

419
00:52:48,555 --> 00:53:24,652
I've warned you!

420
00:53:24,652 --> 00:53:26,082
Hey JiHoo

421
00:53:26,082 --> 00:53:29,642
I don't ever want to see this crazy girl again!

422
00:53:29,642 --> 00:54:27,712
Do you hear me?

423
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:29,422
Don't worry.

424
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:35,033
You're not someone that can be forgotten that easily.

425
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:40,046
Maybe because it was so hard on him that he wanted to forget.

426
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:46,527
If it was a bond that could be forgotten just because you want to forget...

427
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:53,554
...would it have been easier?

428
00:54:53,554 --> 00:54:54,879
No way!

429
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:58,004
Who in the world gets special crutches??

430
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,738
I'm telling you the truth.

431
00:54:59,738 --> 00:55:02,376
Do you really think Goo JunPyo will use any old crutches?

432
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:05,746
Here...you hold it.

433
00:55:05,746 --> 00:55:09,499
oh, seriously...why is this thing so light? Doesn't feel like I'm holding anything.

434
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:12,512
This is what's called titanium.

435
00:55:12,512 --> 00:55:16,273
That's really funny, Oppa.

436
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:17,736
JunPyo

437
00:55:17,736 --> 00:55:18,729
Oh JiHoo

438
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:19,008
Oh, you were there?

439
00:55:19,008 --> 00:55:24,006
JanDI unnie

440
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,598
Hello..

441
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:28,129
Unni, did you see JunPyo oppa's crutches?

442
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:34,089
It's titanium...pretty funny, huh? It's not like he's Iron Man or anything...

443
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:42,037
Jandi unni's friend is so handsome.

444
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:52,035
Hello. I'm Jang Yumi. Nice to meet you.

445
00:55:52,035 --> 00:56:26,002
It's cold. Let's go back inside.

446
00:56:26,002 --> 00:56:34,719
Who is it?

447
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:40,779
I have brought Pizza.

448
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:44,201
It'll be so great if I can see it through a telescope or something....

449
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:48,632
Oppa, do you like stars?

450
00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:51,647
Stars?

451
00:56:51,647 --> 00:56:54,781
The brightest star in winter...

452
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:59,003
...in other words, like Goo JunPyo.

453
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:10,481
Then, I am this star.

454
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:14,478
Oppa. What's wrong? Are you hurting somewhere?

455
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:20,852
There's something important that I seem to have forgotten.

456
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:23,096
I can't remember it.

457
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:27,382
My chest feels so tight that I feel like I'm going to burst...

458
00:57:27,382 --> 00:57:29,062
Don't stress too much over it.

459
00:57:29,062 --> 00:57:32,272
If it's important, then it will come back eventually...

460
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:36,455
And if it doesn't come back, doesn't it mean that it wasn't really that important to being with?

461
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:46,869
If you keep stressing about it, it won't be good for you physically.

462
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:48,176
Yo..What's up?

463
00:57:48,176 --> 00:57:49,664
Are you okay?

464
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:51,101
Hello..

465
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:52,277
We meet again.

466
00:57:52,277 --> 00:57:53,975
We are H.C.

467
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:55,411
H.C.??

468
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,005
Hospital couple.

469
00:57:57,005 --> 00:58:01,736
All the patients and the nurses basically gave us that official title.

470
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:04,672
What do you think? Do we suit each other?

471
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:06,441
Jun Pyo

472
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,995
Do you still not remember anything ?

473
00:58:08,995 --> 00:58:11,179
What exactly am I supposed to remember?

474
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:12,087
Geum JanDi

475
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:14,071
You don't remember?

476
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:16,466
So why do you keep talking about Jandi or something?!

477
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:20,154
I mean why should I remember your girl?

478
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:22,023
Oh, forget it!

479
00:58:22,023 --> 00:58:25,026
I don't know where you met this girl...so unsophisticated..

480
00:58:25,026 --> 00:58:28,062
What does she think she is...a gang member or something?

481
00:58:28,062 --> 00:58:29,764
Just make sure she doesn't come in and out of my hospital room.

482
00:58:29,764 --> 00:58:33,134
Goo JunPyo

483
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:55,029
Please Stop.

484
00:58:55,029 --> 00:59:20,615
What is wrong with him?

485
00:59:20,615 --> 00:59:34,462
SunBae

486
00:59:34,462 --> 00:59:38,132
I'll bring tea.

487
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:44,772
I'm sorry

488
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:47,875
Why should you be sorry?

489
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,563
I'm the one who is sorry.

490
00:59:50,563 --> 00:59:56,618
I got so mad without even my knowing...

491
00:59:56,618 --> 01:00:00,011
I didn't stop you because I thought JunPyo would be hurt...

492
01:00:00,011 --> 01:00:03,973
If you hit him, I thought you would be hurt more, emotionally.

493
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:11,724
That's why I stopped you .

494
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:13,978
How long did you wait outside?

495
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:20,164
Why are your hands so cold?

496
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:27,871
Let me see

497
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:29,869
the one that's cold

498
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:33,496
is your heart.

499
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:41,072
You don't have to pretend to be strong in front of me.

500
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:46,123
I'm not pretending to be strong.

501
01:00:46,123 --> 01:00:49,275
It's because you're here.

502
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:57,056
You being here gives me strength.

503
01:00:57,056 --> 01:01:49,238
I'll go make tea.

504
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:55,319
Abracadabra,Gu JunPyo, remember Geum JanDi.

505
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,069
I remember.

506
01:01:57,069 --> 01:02:00,439
The thing I forgot is...

507
01:02:00,439 --> 01:02:03,756
you, right? It's all over now.

508
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:05,977
That in this ridiculous way...

509
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:07,091
...you guys are ending....

510
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:11,149
I can't go along with it.

511
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:13,097
That girl's facial expression...I can't seem to erase...

512
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,198
In the end...

513
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:19,743
Geum JanDi and Goo JunPyo...

514
01:02:19,743 --> 01:02:21,258
...only amounted to this...

515
01:02:21,258 --> 01:02:26,979
This is all it amounted to..

516
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:32,047
We have gathered you all here to announce something special.

517
01:02:32,047 --> 99:59:59,999
Goo JunPyo and Jang Yumi, we have decided to go study in the US next month.

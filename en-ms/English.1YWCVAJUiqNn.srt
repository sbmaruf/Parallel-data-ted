00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,390
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,720
SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,120
ADVENTURE I.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,630
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

5
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,169
I.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,630
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,750
I have seldom heard him mention her under

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,540
any other name.

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,109
In his eyes she eclipses and predominates

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,089
the whole of her sex.

11
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:28,599
It was not that he felt any emotion akin to

12
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,179
love for Irene Adler.

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,060
All emotions, and that one particularly,

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,040
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,439
admirably balanced mind.

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,270
He was, I take it, the most perfect

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,220
reasoning and observing machine that the

18
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,459
world has seen, but as a lover he would

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,540
have placed himself in a false position.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,920
He never spoke of the softer passions, save

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,150
with a gibe and a sneer.

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,049
They were admirable things for the

23
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,250
observer--excellent for drawing the veil

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,530
from men's motives and actions.

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,730
But for the trained reasoner to admit such

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,530
intrusions into his own delicate and finely

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,270
adjusted temperament was to introduce a

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,680
distracting factor which might throw a

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,520
doubt upon all his mental results.

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,270
Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack

31
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,050
in one of his own high-power lenses, would

32
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,940
not be more disturbing than a strong

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,750
emotion in a nature such as his.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,030
And yet there was but one woman to him, and

35
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,660
that woman was the late Irene Adler, of

36
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,830
dubious and questionable memory.

37
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,780
I had seen little of Holmes lately.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,860
My marriage had drifted us away from each

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,110
other.

40
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,900
My own complete happiness, and the home-

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,640
centred interests which rise up around the

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,150
man who first finds himself master of his

43
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,590
own establishment, were sufficient to

44
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,240
absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,490
loathed every form of society with his

46
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,420
whole Bohemian soul, remained in our

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,130
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his

48
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,910
old books, and alternating from week to

49
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,920
week between cocaine and ambition, the

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,200
drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,060
energy of his own keen nature.

52
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,349
He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by

53
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,529
the study of crime, and occupied his

54
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,590
immense faculties and extraordinary powers

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,090
of observation in following out those

56
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,820
clues, and clearing up those mysteries

57
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,079
which had been abandoned as hopeless by the

58
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,959
official police.

59
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,920
From time to time I heard some vague

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,490
account of his doings: of his summons to

61
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,859
Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder,

62
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,879
of his clearing up of the singular tragedy

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,389
of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,

64
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,520
and finally of the mission which he had

65
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,109
accomplished so delicately and successfully

66
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,179
for the reigning family of Holland.

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,100
Beyond these signs of his activity,

68
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,589
however, which I merely shared with all the

69
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,430
readers of the daily press, I knew little

70
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,390
of my former friend and companion.

71
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,679
One night--it was on the twentieth of

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,500
March, 1888--I was returning from a journey

73
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,039
to a patient (for I had now returned to

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
civil practice), when my way led me through

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
Baker Street.

76
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,219
As I passed the well-remembered door, which

77
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,919
must always be associated in my mind with

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,560
my wooing, and with the dark incidents of

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,630
the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a

80
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,619
keen desire to see Holmes again, and to

81
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,210
know how he was employing his extraordinary

82
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,079
powers.

83
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,939
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even

84
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,469
as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare

85
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,789
figure pass twice in a dark silhouette

86
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,630
against the blind.

87
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:46,569
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly,

88
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,049
with his head sunk upon his chest and his

89
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,579
hands clasped behind him.

90
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,050
To me, who knew his every mood and habit,

91
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,219
his attitude and manner told their own

92
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,309
story.

93
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,940
He was at work again.

94
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,270
He had risen out of his drug-created dreams

95
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,539
and was hot upon the scent of some new

96
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:05,940
problem.

97
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,859
I rang the bell and was shown up to the

98
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,819
chamber which had formerly been in part my

99
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,309
own.

100
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,770
His manner was not effusive.

101
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,769
It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to

102
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,159
see me.

103
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,759
With hardly a word spoken, but with a

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,440
kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair,

105
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,160
threw across his case of cigars, and

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,980
indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in

107
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,310
the corner.

108
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,540
Then he stood before the fire and looked me

109
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,170
over in his singular introspective fashion.

110
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,880
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked.

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,700
"I think, Watson, that you have put on

112
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,890
seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

113
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,890
"Seven!"

114
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,480
I answered.

115
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,390
"Indeed, I should have thought a little

116
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,380
more.

117
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,190
Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.

118
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,040
And in practice again, I observe.

119
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,350
You did not tell me that you intended to go

120
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,890
into harness."

121
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,700
"Then, how do you know?"

122
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,160
"I see it, I deduce it.

123
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,130
How do I know that you have been getting

124
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,390
yourself very wet lately, and that you have

125
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,440
a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

126
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,690
"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too

127
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,720
much.

128
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,420
You would certainly have been burned, had

129
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,390
you lived a few centuries ago.

130
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,010
It is true that I had a country walk on

131
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,310
Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess,

132
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,400
but as I have changed my clothes I can't

133
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,430
imagine how you deduce it.

134
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,470
As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and

135
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,720
my wife has given her notice, but there,

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
again, I fail to see how you work it out."

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,500
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long,

138
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,060
nervous hands together.

139
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,400
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my

140
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,670
eyes tell me that on the inside of your

141
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,400
left shoe, just where the firelight strikes

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,660
it, the leather is scored by six almost

143
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,320
parallel cuts.

144
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Obviously they have been caused by someone

145
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,960
who has very carelessly scraped round the

146
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,260
edges of the sole in order to remove

147
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,450
crusted mud from it.

148
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,980
Hence, you see, my double deduction that

149
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,760
you had been out in vile weather, and that

150
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,210
you had a particularly malignant boot-

151
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,650
slitting specimen of the London slavey.

152
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,410
As to your practice, if a gentleman walks

153
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,620
into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a

154
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,020
black mark of nitrate of silver upon his

155
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,380
right forefinger, and a bulge on the right

156
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,800
side of his top-hat to show where he has

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,690
secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,

158
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,620
indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an

159
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,450
active member of the medical profession."

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,370
I could not help laughing at the ease with

161
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,240
which he explained his process of

162
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,750
deduction.

163
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,970
"When I hear you give your reasons," I

164
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,730
remarked, "the thing always appears to me

165
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,570
to be so ridiculously simple that I could

166
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,570
easily do it myself, though at each

167
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,970
successive instance of your reasoning I am

168
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,060
baffled until you explain your process.

169
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,900
And yet I believe that my eyes are as good

170
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,460
as yours."

171
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,920
"Quite so," he answered, lighting a

172
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,380
cigarette, and throwing himself down into

173
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,050
an armchair.

174
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,870
"You see, but you do not observe.

175
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,670
The distinction is clear.

176
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,280
For example, you have frequently seen the

177
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,310
steps which lead up from the hall to this

178
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,620
room."

179
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,280
"Frequently."

180
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,940
"How often?"

181
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,860
"Well, some hundreds of times."

182
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,430
"Then how many are there?"

183
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,680
"How many?

184
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,700
I don't know."

185
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,150
"Quite so!

186
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,840
You have not observed.

187
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,490
And yet you have seen.

188
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,320
That is just my point.

189
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,680
Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,640
because I have both seen and observed.

191
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,050
By-the-way, since you are interested in

192
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,190
these little problems, and since you are

193
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,390
good enough to chronicle one or two of my

194
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,480
trifling experiences, you may be interested

195
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,650
in this."

196
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,020
He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted

197
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,180
note-paper which had been lying open upon

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,620
the table.

199
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,810
"It came by the last post," said he.

200
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,020
"Read it aloud."

201
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,220
The note was undated, and without either

202
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,600
signature or address.

203
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,100
"There will call upon you to-night, at a

204
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,370
quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a

205
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,200
gentleman who desires to consult you upon a

206
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,259
matter of the very deepest moment.

207
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,579
Your recent services to one of the royal

208
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,669
houses of Europe have shown that you are

209
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,599
one who may safely be trusted with matters

210
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,440
which are of an importance which can hardly

211
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,249
be exaggerated.

212
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,229
This account of you we have from all

213
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,960
quarters received.

214
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,969
Be in your chamber then at that hour, and

215
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,600
do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a

216
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,850
mask."

217
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,290
"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked.

218
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,280
"What do you imagine that it means?"

219
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,519
"I have no data yet.

220
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,139
It is a capital mistake to theorize before

221
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,089
one has data.

222
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,559
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to

223
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,350
suit theories, instead of theories to suit

224
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,420
facts.

225
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,140
But the note itself.

226
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,919
What do you deduce from it?"

227
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,670
I carefully examined the writing, and the

228
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,700
paper upon which it was written.

229
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:34,389
"The man who wrote it was presumably well

230
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,619
to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate

231
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,800
my companion's processes.

232
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,030
"Such paper could not be bought under half

233
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,639
a crown a packet.

234
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,769
It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

235
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,669
"Peculiar--that is the very word," said

236
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,450
Holmes.

237
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,019
"It is not an English paper at all.

238
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,339
Hold it up to the light."

239
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,049
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small

240
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,130
"g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small

241
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:09,409
"t" woven into the texture of the paper.

242
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,060
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

243
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,529
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his

244
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,079
monogram, rather."

245
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:18,699
"Not at all.

246
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,619
The 'G' with the small 't' stands for

247
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,070
'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for

248
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:25,309
'Company.'

249
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,469
It is a customary contraction like our

250
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,880
'Co.'

251
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,799
'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.'

252
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,920
Now for the 'Eg.'

253
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,660
Let us glance at our Continental

254
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,280
Gazetteer."

255
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,720
He took down a heavy brown volume from his

256
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,270
shelves.

257
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,229
"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria.

258
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,580
It is in a German-speaking country--in

259
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,819
Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.

260
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,209
'Remarkable as being the scene of the death

261
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,889
of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-

262
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:01,059
factories and paper-mills.'

263
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,369
Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?"

264
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,649
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great

265
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,789
blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

266
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,860
"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

267
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,160
"Precisely.

268
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,570
And the man who wrote the note is a German.

269
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,909
Do you note the peculiar construction of

270
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,750
the sentence--'This account of you we have

271
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,129
from all quarters received.'

272
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,339
A Frenchman or Russian could not have

273
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,499
written that.

274
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:32,039
It is the German who is so uncourteous to

275
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,470
his verbs.

276
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,000
It only remains, therefore, to discover

277
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,199
what is wanted by this German who writes

278
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:41,409
upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a

279
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,130
mask to showing his face.

280
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,310
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to

281
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,699
resolve all our doubts."

282
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,229
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of

283
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,370
horses' hoofs and grating wheels against

284
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:57,199
the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the

285
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,059
bell.

286
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:58,929
Holmes whistled.

287
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,010
"A pair, by the sound," said he.

288
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:05,839
"Yes," he continued, glancing out of the

289
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,699
window.

290
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,629
"A nice little brougham and a pair of

291
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,649
beauties.

292
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,209
A hundred and fifty guineas apiece.

293
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,289
There's money in this case, Watson, if

294
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,550
there is nothing else."

295
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,810
"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

296
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,359
"Not a bit, Doctor.

297
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,940
Stay where you are.

298
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,959
I am lost without my Boswell.

299
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,619
And this promises to be interesting.

300
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,719
It would be a pity to miss it."

301
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,340
"But your client--"

302
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,769
"Never mind him.

303
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:35,769
I may want your help, and so may he.

304
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,139
Here he comes.

305
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,389
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give

306
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:40,629
us your best attention."

307
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,399
A slow and heavy step, which had been heard

308
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,139
upon the stairs and in the passage, paused

309
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,529
immediately outside the door.

310
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,799
Then there was a loud and authoritative

311
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,010
tap.

312
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,109
"Come in!" said Holmes.

313
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,230
A man entered who could hardly have been

314
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,310
less than six feet six inches in height,

315
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,479
with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.

316
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,810
His dress was rich with a richness which

317
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,479
would, in England, be looked upon as akin

318
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,740
to bad taste.

319
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,109
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed

320
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,120
across the sleeves and fronts of his

321
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:19,799
double-breasted coat, while the deep blue

322
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,920
cloak which was thrown over his shoulders

323
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,760
was lined with flame-coloured silk and

324
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,139
secured at the neck with a brooch which

325
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,119
consisted of a single flaming beryl.

326
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,459
Boots which extended halfway up his calves,

327
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,079
and which were trimmed at the tops with

328
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,049
rich brown fur, completed the impression of

329
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,890
barbaric opulence which was suggested by

330
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,739
his whole appearance.

331
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,700
He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand,

332
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,059
while he wore across the upper part of his

333
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,559
face, extending down past the cheekbones, a

334
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,309
black vizard mask, which he had apparently

335
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:57,099
adjusted that very moment, for his hand was

336
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,830
still raised to it as he entered.

337
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,760
From the lower part of the face he appeared

338
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,519
to be a man of strong character, with a

339
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,509
thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight

340
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:10,359
chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the

341
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,200
length of obstinacy.

342
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,369
"You had my note?" he asked with a deep

343
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,909
harsh voice and a strongly marked German

344
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,220
accent.

345
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,980
"I told you that I would call."

346
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,100
He looked from one to the other of us, as

347
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,170
if uncertain which to address.

348
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,050
"Pray take a seat," said Holmes.

349
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,349
"This is my friend and colleague, Dr.

350
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,890
Watson, who is occasionally good enough to

351
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,689
help me in my cases.

352
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:40,469
Whom have I the honour to address?"

353
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,220
"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm,

354
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,280
a Bohemian nobleman.

355
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,819
I understand that this gentleman, your

356
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,539
friend, is a man of honour and discretion,

357
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,880
whom I may trust with a matter of the most

358
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:56,999
extreme importance.

359
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,259
If not, I should much prefer to communicate

360
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:02,619
with you alone."

361
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:05,829
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the

362
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:08,989
wrist and pushed me back into my chair.

363
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,070
"It is both, or none," said he.

364
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,369
"You may say before this gentleman anything

365
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:16,679
which you may say to me."

366
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,729
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders.

367
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,260
"Then I must begin," said he, "by binding

368
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:27,329
you both to absolute secrecy for two years;

369
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,329
at the end of that time the matter will be

370
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,319
of no importance.

371
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,889
At present it is not too much to say that

372
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,639
it is of such weight it may have an

373
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,509
influence upon European history."

374
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,509
"I promise," said Holmes.

375
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,379
"And I."

376
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,409
"You will excuse this mask," continued our

377
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,360
strange visitor.

378
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,939
"The august person who employs me wishes

379
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,169
his agent to be unknown to you, and I may

380
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,550
confess at once that the title by which I

381
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,500
have just called myself is not exactly my

382
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:02,749
own."

383
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,770
"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

384
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,059
"The circumstances are of great delicacy,

385
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,939
and every precaution has to be taken to

386
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,289
quench what might grow to be an immense

387
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,870
scandal and seriously compromise one of the

388
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,069
reigning families of Europe.

389
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:25,069
To speak plainly, the matter implicates the

390
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:28,479
great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings

391
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,270
of Bohemia."

392
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
"I was also aware of that," murmured

393
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,839
Holmes, settling himself down in his

394
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,539
armchair and closing his eyes.

395
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,609
Our visitor glanced with some apparent

396
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,490
surprise at the languid, lounging figure of

397
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:45,809
the man who had been no doubt depicted to

398
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:49,029
him as the most incisive reasoner and most

399
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:51,669
energetic agent in Europe.

400
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,600
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked

401
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,250
impatiently at his gigantic client.

402
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,209
"If your Majesty would condescend to state

403
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:04,309
your case," he remarked, "I should be

404
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:07,229
better able to advise you."

405
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,550
The man sprang from his chair and paced up

406
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,639
and down the room in uncontrollable

407
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,380
agitation.

408
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,230
Then, with a gesture of desperation, he

409
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,310
tore the mask from his face and hurled it

410
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,019
upon the ground.

411
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,079
"You are right," he cried; "I am the King.

412
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,949
Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

413
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:28,649
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes.

414
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,569
"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was

415
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,930
aware that I was addressing Wilhelm

416
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,289
Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand

417
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,659
Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary

418
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,469
King of Bohemia."

419
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,240
"But you can understand," said our strange

420
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,440
visitor, sitting down once more and passing

421
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,770
his hand over his high white forehead, "you

422
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,559
can understand that I am not accustomed to

423
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,089
doing such business in my own person.

424
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,020
Yet the matter was so delicate that I could

425
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,269
not confide it to an agent without putting

426
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,519
myself in his power.

427
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,929
I have come incognito from Prague for the

428
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,859
purpose of consulting you."

429
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,360
"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting

430
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
his eyes once more.

431
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,329
"The facts are briefly these: Some five

432
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,780
years ago, during a lengthy visit to

433
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:24,539
Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the

434
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,199
well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.

435
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,380
The name is no doubt familiar to you."

436
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,850
"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,"

437
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,320
murmured Holmes without opening his eyes.

438
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,620
For many years he had adopted a system of

439
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,200
docketing all paragraphs concerning men and

440
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
things, so that it was difficult to name a

441
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,710
subject or a person on which he could not

442
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,580
at once furnish information.

443
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,330
In this case I found her biography

444
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,740
sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew

445
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,570
rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had

446
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,450
written a monograph upon the deep-sea

447
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:00,950
fishes.

448
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,830
"Let me see!" said Holmes.

449
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,540
"Hum!

450
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,589
Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.

451
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,900
Contralto--hum!

452
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:15,739
La Scala, hum!

453
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,420
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes!

454
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,119
Retired from operatic stage--ha!

455
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,510
Living in London--quite so!

456
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,500
Your Majesty, as I understand, became

457
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,290
entangled with this young person, wrote her

458
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,949
some compromising letters, and is now

459
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,110
desirous of getting those letters back."

460
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,130
"Precisely so.

461
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,090
But how--"

462
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,530
"Was there a secret marriage?"

463
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:44,729
"None."

464
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,380
"No legal papers or certificates?"

465
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,550
"None."

466
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,319
"Then I fail to follow your Majesty.

467
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,370
If this young person should produce her

468
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,060
letters for blackmailing or other purposes,

469
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,789
how is she to prove their authenticity?"

470
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:03,509
"There is the writing."

471
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,370
"Pooh, pooh!

472
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,310
Forgery."

473
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,489
"My private note-paper."

474
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,120
"Stolen."

475
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,650
"My own seal."

476
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:14,429
"Imitated."

477
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,049
"My photograph."

478
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,839
"Bought."

479
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,720
"We were both in the photograph."

480
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,190
"Oh, dear!

481
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,320
That is very bad!

482
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Your Majesty has indeed committed an

483
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,220
indiscretion."

484
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,150
"I was mad--insane."

485
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,509
"You have compromised yourself seriously."

486
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,700
"I was only Crown Prince then.

487
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,840
I was young.

488
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,960
I am but thirty now."

489
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,010
"It must be recovered."

490
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,230
"We have tried and failed."

491
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,000
"Your Majesty must pay.

492
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,970
It must be bought."

493
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,120
"She will not sell."

494
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
"Stolen, then."

495
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,520
"Five attempts have been made.

496
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,929
Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her

497
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,079
house.

498
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,230
Once we diverted her luggage when she

499
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,400
travelled.

500
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,389
Twice she has been waylaid.

501
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,889
There has been no result."

502
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:09,889
"No sign of it?"

503
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:14,059
"Absolutely none."

504
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:14,529
Holmes laughed.

505
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,319
"It is quite a pretty little problem," said

506
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,570
he.

507
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,840
"But a very serious one to me," returned

508
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,040
the King reproachfully.

509
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,769
"Very, indeed.

510
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:30,509
And what does she propose to do with the

511
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,680
photograph?"

512
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,399
"To ruin me."

513
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,219
"But how?"

514
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,430
"I am about to be married."

515
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,679
"So I have heard."

516
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,399
"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen,

517
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:47,609
second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.

518
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,840
You may know the strict principles of her

519
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,020
family.

520
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,899
She is herself the very soul of delicacy.

521
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,569
A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would

522
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,800
bring the matter to an end."

523
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,549
"And Irene Adler?"

524
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:05,229
"Threatens to send them the photograph.

525
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,710
And she will do it.

526
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,610
I know that she will do it.

527
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,040
You do not know her, but she has a soul of

528
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:13,549
steel.

529
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,389
She has the face of the most beautiful of

530
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:18,379
women, and the mind of the most resolute of

531
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,630
men.

532
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,750
Rather than I should marry another woman,

533
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,930
there are no lengths to which she would not

534
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:26,539
go--none."

535
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,589
"You are sure that she has not sent it

536
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,010
yet?"

537
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,390
"I am sure."

538
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:33,689
"And why?"

539
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,980
"Because she has said that she would send

540
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,290
it on the day when the betrothal was

541
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,069
publicly proclaimed.

542
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,600
That will be next Monday."

543
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,570
"Oh, then we have three days yet," said

544
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,930
Holmes with a yawn.

545
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,519
"That is very fortunate, as I have one or

546
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,139
two matters of importance to look into just

547
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,549
at present.

548
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:56,509
Your Majesty will, of course, stay in

549
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,580
London for the present?"

550
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,400
"Certainly.

551
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,459
You will find me at the Langham under the

552
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,830
name of the Count Von Kramm."

553
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,700
"Then I shall drop you a line to let you

554
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,220
know how we progress."

555
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,600
"Pray do so.

556
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,730
I shall be all anxiety."

557
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,910
"Then, as to money?"

558
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,119
"You have carte blanche."

559
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,390
"Absolutely?"

560
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:24,399
"I tell you that I would give one of the

561
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:27,729
provinces of my kingdom to have that

562
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,400
photograph."

563
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,889
"And for present expenses?"

564
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,449
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag

565
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,160
from under his cloak and laid it on the

566
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:35,509
table.

567
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,600
"There are three hundred pounds in gold and

568
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
seven hundred in notes," he said.

569
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,639
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of

570
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:48,099
his note-book and handed it to him.

571
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,760
"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

572
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,349
"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St.

573
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,620
John's Wood."

574
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,610
Holmes took a note of it.

575
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,640
"One other question," said he.

576
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,599
"Was the photograph a cabinet?"

577
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,510
"It was."

578
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:10,019
"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I

579
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,069
trust that we shall soon have some good

580
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,790
news for you.

581
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,460
And good-night, Watson," he added, as the

582
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,600
wheels of the royal brougham rolled down

583
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,020
the street.

584
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:22,019
"If you will be good enough to call to-

585
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,639
morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should

586
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,889
like to chat this little matter over with

587
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:27,139
you."

588
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:32,199
II.

589
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,140
At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker

590
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,169
Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.

591
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,559
The landlady informed me that he had left

592
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,519
the house shortly after eight o'clock in

593
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,639
the morning.

594
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:46,349
I sat down beside the fire, however, with

595
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,780
the intention of awaiting him, however long

596
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,299
he might be.

597
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:52,329
I was already deeply interested in his

598
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,980
inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by

599
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,200
none of the grim and strange features which

600
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,890
were associated with the two crimes which I

601
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:03,259
have already recorded, still, the nature of

602
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:05,849
the case and the exalted station of his

603
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,970
client gave it a character of its own.

604
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,360
Indeed, apart from the nature of the

605
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
investigation which my friend had on hand,

606
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,770
there was something in his masterly grasp

607
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,559
of a situation, and his keen, incisive

608
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,589
reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me

609
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,490
to study his system of work, and to follow

610
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,970
the quick, subtle methods by which he

611
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,690
disentangled the most inextricable

612
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:30,940
mysteries.

613
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,949
So accustomed was I to his invariable

614
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,660
success that the very possibility of his

615
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,389
failing had ceased to enter into my head.

616
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:42,669
It was close upon four before the door

617
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,679
opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-

618
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,679
kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed

619
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,489
face and disreputable clothes, walked into

620
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,010
the room.

621
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,989
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing

622
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,040
powers in the use of disguises, I had to

623
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,559
look three times before I was certain that

624
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,599
it was indeed he.

625
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,999
With a nod he vanished into the bedroom,

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,370
whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-

627
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,590
suited and respectable, as of old.

628
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,550
Putting his hands into his pockets, he

629
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:15,959
stretched out his legs in front of the fire

630
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,190
and laughed heartily for some minutes.

631
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,550
"Well, really!" he cried, and then he

632
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:24,529
choked and laughed again until he was

633
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,699
obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in

634
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,390
the chair.

635
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:29,779
"What is it?"

636
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:33,299
"It's quite too funny.

637
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,769
I am sure you could never guess how I

638
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,429
employed my morning, or what I ended by

639
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,989
doing."

640
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,920
"I can't imagine.

641
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,339
I suppose that you have been watching the

642
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,570
habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss

643
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,310
Irene Adler."

644
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,239
"Quite so; but the sequel was rather

645
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,660
unusual.

646
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:54,699
I will tell you, however.

647
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,780
I left the house a little after eight

648
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,719
o'clock this morning in the character of a

649
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,880
groom out of work.

650
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,540
There is a wonderful sympathy and

651
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,159
freemasonry among horsey men.

652
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,779
Be one of them, and you will know all that

653
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,589
there is to know.

654
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,230
I soon found Briony Lodge.

655
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,840
It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the

656
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,200
back, but built out in front right up to

657
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,300
the road, two stories.

658
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:20,409
Chubb lock to the door.

659
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,580
Large sitting-room on the right side, well

660
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,510
furnished, with long windows almost to the

661
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,439
floor, and those preposterous English

662
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,820
window fasteners which a child could open.

663
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,060
Behind there was nothing remarkable, save

664
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,789
that the passage window could be reached

665
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,199
from the top of the coach-house.

666
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:41,719
I walked round it and examined it closely

667
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,060
from every point of view, but without

668
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,289
noting anything else of interest.

669
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,229
"I then lounged down the street and found,

670
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,240
as I expected, that there was a mews in a

671
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,470
lane which runs down by one wall of the

672
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:55,760
garden.

673
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,940
I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down

674
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,810
their horses, and received in exchange

675
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,839
twopence, a glass of half and half, two

676
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,370
fills of shag tobacco, and as much

677
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,890
information as I could desire about Miss

678
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,549
Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other

679
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:14,839
people in the neighbourhood in whom I was

680
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,110
not in the least interested, but whose

681
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,010
biographies I was compelled to listen to."

682
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,929
"And what of Irene Adler?"

683
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:24,659
I asked.

684
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,049
"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads

685
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,959
down in that part.

686
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,010
She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet

687
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,449
on this planet.

688
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,790
So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.

689
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,229
She lives quietly, sings at concerts,

690
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,690
drives out at five every day, and returns

691
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,400
at seven sharp for dinner.

692
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,479
Seldom goes out at other times, except when

693
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,830
she sings.

694
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,410
Has only one male visitor, but a good deal

695
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:50,759
of him.

696
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,350
He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never

697
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,960
calls less than once a day, and often

698
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,260
twice.

699
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,389
He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner

700
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,159
Temple.

701
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,149
See the advantages of a cabman as a

702
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:06,869
confidant.

703
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,310
They had driven him home a dozen times from

704
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,129
Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.

705
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,670
When I had listened to all they had to

706
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,379
tell, I began to walk up and down near

707
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:20,199
Briony Lodge once more, and to think over

708
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,860
my plan of campaign.

709
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,530
"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an

710
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:28,029
important factor in the matter.

711
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:29,779
He was a lawyer.

712
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:30,809
That sounded ominous.

713
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:34,639
What was the relation between them, and

714
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,589
what the object of his repeated visits?

715
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,240
Was she his client, his friend, or his

716
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,630
mistress?

717
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,379
If the former, she had probably transferred

718
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:47,649
the photograph to his keeping.

719
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:49,969
If the latter, it was less likely.

720
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,780
On the issue of this question depended

721
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,469
whether I should continue my work at Briony

722
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,760
Lodge, or turn my attention to the

723
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,389
gentleman's chambers in the Temple.

724
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,010
It was a delicate point, and it widened the

725
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,209
field of my inquiry.

726
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,690
I fear that I bore you with these details,

727
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,760
but I have to let you see my little

728
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,399
difficulties, if you are to understand the

729
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,219
situation."

730
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,150
"I am following you closely," I answered.

731
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,179
"I was still balancing the matter in my

732
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,639
mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony

733
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,429
Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.

734
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,490
He was a remarkably handsome man, dark,

735
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,710
aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man

736
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,560
of whom I had heard.

737
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,399
He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted

738
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,209
to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the

739
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,400
maid who opened the door with the air of a

740
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:44,829
man who was thoroughly at home.

741
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,189
"He was in the house about half an hour,

742
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,250
and I could catch glimpses of him in the

743
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,160
windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and

744
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,969
down, talking excitedly, and waving his

745
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,210
arms.

746
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,110
Of her I could see nothing.

747
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,120
Presently he emerged, looking even more

748
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,200
flurried than before.

749
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,739
As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a

750
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,890
gold watch from his pocket and looked at it

751
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:12,129
earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he

752
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:14,799
shouted, 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in

753
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,239
Regent Street, and then to the Church of

754
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,810
St. Monica in the Edgeware Road.

755
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,909
Half a guinea if you do it in twenty

756
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:22,159
minutes!'

757
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:25,869
"Away they went, and I was just wondering

758
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,120
whether I should not do well to follow them

759
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,780
when up the lane came a neat little landau,

760
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:33,899
the coachman with his coat only half-

761
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,959
buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while

762
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,070
all the tags of his harness were sticking

763
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,800
out of the buckles.

764
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,739
It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of

765
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,200
the hall door and into it.

766
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:46,499
I only caught a glimpse of her at the

767
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:49,269
moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a

768
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,249
face that a man might die for.

769
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:54,659
"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she

770
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:57,159
cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach

771
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,079
it in twenty minutes.'

772
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,210
"This was quite too good to lose, Watson.

773
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,840
I was just balancing whether I should run

774
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,230
for it, or whether I should perch behind

775
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,500
her landau when a cab came through the

776
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:09,849
street.

777
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,060
The driver looked twice at such a shabby

778
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,769
fare, but I jumped in before he could

779
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:15,209
object.

780
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,620
'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and

781
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,970
half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty

782
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,220
minutes.'

783
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,170
It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and

784
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,029
of course it was clear enough what was in

785
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,249
the wind.

786
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,009
"My cabby drove fast.

787
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,299
I don't think I ever drove faster, but the

788
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:35,089
others were there before us.

789
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,770
The cab and the landau with their steaming

790
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,769
horses were in front of the door when I

791
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:39,399
arrived.

792
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,399
I paid the man and hurried into the church.

793
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,579
There was not a soul there save the two

794
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,730
whom I had followed and a surpliced

795
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,630
clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating

796
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:51,849
with them.

797
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,300
They were all three standing in a knot in

798
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,689
front of the altar.

799
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,150
I lounged up the side aisle like any other

800
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:59,959
idler who has dropped into a church.

801
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,650
Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the

802
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,769
altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton

803
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:08,859
came running as hard as he could towards

804
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,850
me.

805
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,850
"'Thank God,' he cried.

806
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,720
'You'll do.

807
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,290
Come!

808
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:14,939
Come!'

809
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,020
"'What then?'

810
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,739
I asked.

811
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,260
"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or

812
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,179
it won't be legal.'

813
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,269
"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and

814
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,709
before I knew where I was I found myself

815
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,930
mumbling responses which were whispered in

816
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:32,779
my ear, and vouching for things of which I

817
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,479
knew nothing, and generally assisting in

818
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,200
the secure tying up of Irene Adler,

819
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,240
spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.

820
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,030
It was all done in an instant, and there

821
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:46,869
was the gentleman thanking me on the one

822
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,890
side and the lady on the other, while the

823
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,839
clergyman beamed on me in front.

824
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,849
It was the most preposterous position in

825
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,680
which I ever found myself in my life, and

826
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,439
it was the thought of it that started me

827
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,860
laughing just now.

828
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,870
It seems that there had been some

829
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,660
informality about their license, that the

830
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,239
clergyman absolutely refused to marry them

831
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,940
without a witness of some sort, and that my

832
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,120
lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from

833
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,749
having to sally out into the streets in

834
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,560
search of a best man.

835
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,839
The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean

836
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,389
to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of

837
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,769
the occasion."

838
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,160
"This is a very unexpected turn of

839
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,329
affairs," said I; "and what then?"

840
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:34,769
"Well, I found my plans very seriously

841
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,230
menaced.

842
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:37,969
It looked as if the pair might take an

843
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,880
immediate departure, and so necessitate

844
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,309
very prompt and energetic measures on my

845
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:43,879
part.

846
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:46,509
At the church door, however, they

847
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,900
separated, he driving back to the Temple,

848
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:52,449
and she to her own house.

849
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,620
'I shall drive out in the park at five as

850
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,729
usual,' she said as she left him.

851
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,580
I heard no more.

852
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,879
They drove away in different directions,

853
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,300
and I went off to make my own

854
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,910
arrangements."

855
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,610
"Which are?"

856
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:09,619
"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he

857
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,839
answered, ringing the bell.

858
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,079
"I have been too busy to think of food, and

859
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,489
I am likely to be busier still this

860
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,520
evening.

861
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,210
By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-

862
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,920
operation."

863
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,280
"I shall be delighted."

864
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,280
"You don't mind breaking the law?"

865
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
"Not in the least."

866
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,160
"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

867
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,510
"Not in a good cause."

868
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,500
"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

869
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,770
"Then I am your man."

870
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,990
"I was sure that I might rely on you."

871
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,200
"But what is it you wish?"

872
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,350
"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I

873
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,519
will make it clear to you.

874
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,260
Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the

875
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,460
simple fare that our landlady had provided,

876
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,080
"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have

877
00:35:59,079 --> 00:35:59,769
not much time.

878
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,950
It is nearly five now.

879
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,230
In two hours we must be on the scene of

880
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,560
action.

881
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,939
Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from

882
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,710
her drive at seven.

883
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,970
We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

884
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,030
"And what then?"

885
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,060
"You must leave that to me.

886
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:22,349
I have already arranged what is to occur.

887
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,259
There is only one point on which I must

888
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,170
insist.

889
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,370
You must not interfere, come what may.

890
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,239
You understand?"

891
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,970
"I am to be neutral?"

892
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,010
"To do nothing whatever.

893
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:37,029
There will probably be some small

894
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,860
unpleasantness.

895
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:40,419
Do not join in it.

896
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,770
It will end in my being conveyed into the

897
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,900
house.

898
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,020
Four or five minutes afterwards the

899
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,200
sitting-room window will open.

900
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,490
You are to station yourself close to that

901
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,000
open window."

902
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,420
"Yes."

903
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,710
"You are to watch me, for I will be visible

904
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,060
to you."

905
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:57,399
"Yes."

906
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,510
"And when I raise my hand--so--you will

907
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,580
throw into the room what I give you to

908
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:06,809
throw, and will, at the same time, raise

909
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,769
the cry of fire.

910
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,770
You quite follow me?"

911
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,610
"Entirely."

912
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,579
"It is nothing very formidable," he said,

913
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:18,259
taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his

914
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,510
pocket.

915
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,120
"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,

916
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,209
fitted with a cap at either end to make it

917
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,280
self-lighting.

918
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,520
Your task is confined to that.

919
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,980
When you raise your cry of fire, it will be

920
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,640
taken up by quite a number of people.

921
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,430
You may then walk to the end of the street,

922
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,480
and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.

923
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,380
I hope that I have made myself clear?"

924
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,810
"I am to remain neutral, to get near the

925
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:48,329
window, to watch you, and at the signal to

926
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,409
throw in this object, then to raise the cry

927
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,580
of fire, and to wait you at the corner of

928
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:55,889
the street."

929
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,820
"Precisely."

930
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,889
"Then you may entirely rely on me."

931
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,380
"That is excellent.

932
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,930
I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I

933
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,160
prepare for the new role I have to play."

934
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,460
He disappeared into his bedroom and

935
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,420
returned in a few minutes in the character

936
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,760
of an amiable and simple-minded

937
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,470
Nonconformist clergyman.

938
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,750
His broad black hat, his baggy trousers,

939
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,510
his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and

940
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,760
general look of peering and benevolent

941
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,250
curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone

942
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,760
could have equalled.

943
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,040
It was not merely that Holmes changed his

944
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,350
costume.

945
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,549
His expression, his manner, his very soul

946
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,910
seemed to vary with every fresh part that

947
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,380
he assumed.

948
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,490
The stage lost a fine actor, even as

949
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,770
science lost an acute reasoner, when he

950
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,750
became a specialist in crime.

951
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,850
It was a quarter past six when we left

952
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:57,549
Baker Street, and it still wanted ten

953
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,420
minutes to the hour when we found ourselves

954
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,710
in Serpentine Avenue.

955
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,900
It was already dusk, and the lamps were

956
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,540
just being lighted as we paced up and down

957
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,270
in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the

958
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,450
coming of its occupant.

959
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,870
The house was just such as I had pictured

960
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,209
it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct

961
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,140
description, but the locality appeared to

962
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,930
be less private than I expected.

963
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,600
On the contrary, for a small street in a

964
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,069
quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably

965
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:27,499
animated.

966
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,360
There was a group of shabbily dressed men

967
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,179
smoking and laughing in a corner, a

968
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,200
scissors-grinder with his wheel, two

969
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,690
guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-

970
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,520
girl, and several well-dressed young men

971
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,680
who were lounging up and down with cigars

972
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,700
in their mouths.

973
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,740
"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to

974
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,220
and fro in front of the house, "this

975
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,190
marriage rather simplifies matters.

976
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,300
The photograph becomes a double-edged

977
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,950
weapon now.

978
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,570
The chances are that she would be as averse

979
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:02,939
to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as

980
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,280
our client is to its coming to the eyes of

981
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,940
his princess.

982
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:10,359
Now the question is, Where are we to find

983
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:10,999
the photograph?"

984
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,510
"Where, indeed?"

985
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,680
"It is most unlikely that she carries it

986
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,800
about with her.

987
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:20,309
It is cabinet size.

988
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,689
Too large for easy concealment about a

989
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,330
woman's dress.

990
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,369
She knows that the King is capable of

991
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:28,749
having her waylaid and searched.

992
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,140
Two attempts of the sort have already been

993
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,250
made.

994
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,240
We may take it, then, that she does not

995
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
carry it about with her."

996
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,500
"Where, then?"

997
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,780
"Her banker or her lawyer.

998
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,730
There is that double possibility.

999
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,060
But I am inclined to think neither.

1000
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:49,479
Women are naturally secretive, and they

1001
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,120
like to do their own secreting.

1002
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,219
Why should she hand it over to anyone else?

1003
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,700
She could trust her own guardianship, but

1004
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,930
she could not tell what indirect or

1005
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,140
political influence might be brought to

1006
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,250
bear upon a business man.

1007
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,450
Besides, remember that she had resolved to

1008
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,760
use it within a few days.

1009
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,190
It must be where she can lay her hands upon

1010
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,850
it.

1011
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:15,639
It must be in her own house."

1012
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,500
"But it has twice been burgled."

1013
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,540
"Pshaw!

1014
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,440
They did not know how to look."

1015
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,380
"But how will you look?"

1016
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,390
"I will not look."

1017
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,940
"What then?"

1018
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,770
"I will get her to show me."

1019
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,560
"But she will refuse."

1020
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,459
"She will not be able to.

1021
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,890
But I hear the rumble of wheels.

1022
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,420
It is her carriage.

1023
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,860
Now carry out my orders to the letter."

1024
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:48,029
As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of

1025
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,240
a carriage came round the curve of the

1026
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,580
avenue.

1027
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,899
It was a smart little landau which rattled

1028
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,890
up to the door of Briony Lodge.

1029
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,370
As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at

1030
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:01,729
the corner dashed forward to open the door

1031
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,110
in the hope of earning a copper, but was

1032
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:06,449
elbowed away by another loafer, who had

1033
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,750
rushed up with the same intention.

1034
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,050
A fierce quarrel broke out, which was

1035
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:13,319
increased by the two guardsmen, who took

1036
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:16,489
sides with one of the loungers, and by the

1037
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,050
scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon

1038
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:20,609
the other side.

1039
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,389
A blow was struck, and in an instant the

1040
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,970
lady, who had stepped from her carriage,

1041
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,460
was the centre of a little knot of flushed

1042
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,420
and struggling men, who struck savagely at

1043
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,550
each other with their fists and sticks.

1044
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,709
Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the

1045
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,120
lady; but just as he reached her he gave a

1046
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,269
cry and dropped to the ground, with the

1047
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,930
blood running freely down his face.

1048
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,930
At his fall the guardsmen took to their

1049
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,810
heels in one direction and the loungers in

1050
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,419
the other, while a number of better-dressed

1051
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,280
people, who had watched the scuffle without

1052
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,010
taking part in it, crowded in to help the

1053
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,240
lady and to attend to the injured man.

1054
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,070
Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had

1055
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:07,099
hurried up the steps; but she stood at the

1056
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,979
top with her superb figure outlined against

1057
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,640
the lights of the hall, looking back into

1058
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,680
the street.

1059
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,420
"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she

1060
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,520
asked.

1061
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,950
"He is dead," cried several voices.

1062
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,140
"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted

1063
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,240
another.

1064
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,170
"But he'll be gone before you can get him

1065
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,010
to hospital."

1066
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:33,180
"He's a brave fellow," said a woman.

1067
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,160
"They would have had the lady's purse and

1068
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,640
watch if it hadn't been for him.

1069
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,820
They were a gang, and a rough one, too.

1070
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,829
Ah, he's breathing now."

1071
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,769
"He can't lie in the street.

1072
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,130
May we bring him in, marm?"

1073
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,610
"Surely.

1074
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:51,499
Bring him into the sitting-room.

1075
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,530
There is a comfortable sofa.

1076
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,060
This way, please!"

1077
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,319
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into

1078
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,719
Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal

1079
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,840
room, while I still observed the

1080
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:05,909
proceedings from my post by the window.

1081
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,460
The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had

1082
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,940
not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes

1083
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,160
as he lay upon the couch.

1084
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,240
I do not know whether he was seized with

1085
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,400
compunction at that moment for the part he

1086
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,060
was playing, but I know that I never felt

1087
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:23,159
more heartily ashamed of myself in my life

1088
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,220
than when I saw the beautiful creature

1089
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,500
against whom I was conspiring, or the grace

1090
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,190
and kindliness with which she waited upon

1091
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,020
the injured man.

1092
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,270
And yet it would be the blackest treachery

1093
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,240
to Holmes to draw back now from the part

1094
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,460
which he had intrusted to me.

1095
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,030
I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-

1096
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,560
rocket from under my ulster.

1097
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,039
After all, I thought, we are not injuring

1098
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,050
her.

1099
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:51,469
We are but preventing her from injuring

1100
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:51,810
another.

1101
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,870
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw

1102
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,889
him motion like a man who is in need of

1103
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:58,140
air.

1104
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,490
A maid rushed across and threw open the

1105
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,040
window.

1106
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,460
At the same instant I saw him raise his

1107
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,300
hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket

1108
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:09,299
into the room with a cry of "Fire!"

1109
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,060
The word was no sooner out of my mouth than

1110
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:15,769
the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed

1111
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,180
and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-

1112
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,940
maids--joined in a general shriek of

1113
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,640
"Fire!"

1114
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,610
Thick clouds of smoke curled through the

1115
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,479
room and out at the open window.

1116
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,130
I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and

1117
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,710
a moment later the voice of Holmes from

1118
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,340
within assuring them that it was a false

1119
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:36,589
alarm.

1120
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,539
Slipping through the shouting crowd I made

1121
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,290
my way to the corner of the street, and in

1122
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,410
ten minutes was rejoiced to find my

1123
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,450
friend's arm in mine, and to get away from

1124
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,260
the scene of uproar.

1125
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,950
He walked swiftly and in silence for some

1126
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,850
few minutes until we had turned down one of

1127
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,299
the quiet streets which lead towards the

1128
00:45:56,299 --> 00:45:58,469
Edgeware Road.

1129
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,090
"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he

1130
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:02,189
remarked.

1131
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,880
"Nothing could have been better.

1132
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,360
It is all right."

1133
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,439
"You have the photograph?"

1134
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,820
"I know where it is."

1135
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:13,449
"And how did you find out?"

1136
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,070
"She showed me, as I told you she would."

1137
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:19,189
"I am still in the dark."

1138
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,310
"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he,

1139
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:24,349
laughing.

1140
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,699
"The matter was perfectly simple.

1141
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,290
You, of course, saw that everyone in the

1142
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,970
street was an accomplice.

1143
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,520
They were all engaged for the evening."

1144
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,660
"I guessed as much."

1145
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,910
"Then, when the row broke out, I had a

1146
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,900
little moist red paint in the palm of my

1147
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,580
hand.

1148
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:43,609
I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my

1149
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:45,919
hand to my face, and became a piteous

1150
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,310
spectacle.

1151
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,339
It is an old trick."

1152
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:52,389
"That also I could fathom."

1153
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,470
"Then they carried me in.

1154
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,140
She was bound to have me in.

1155
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,230
What else could she do?

1156
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,400
And into her sitting-room, which was the

1157
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,940
very room which I suspected.

1158
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,420
It lay between that and her bedroom, and I

1159
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,660
was determined to see which.

1160
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,250
They laid me on a couch, I motioned for

1161
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,970
air, they were compelled to open the

1162
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,020
window, and you had your chance."

1163
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,450
"How did that help you?"

1164
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,550
"It was all-important.

1165
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:22,299
When a woman thinks that her house is on

1166
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:25,519
fire, her instinct is at once to rush to

1167
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,160
the thing which she values most.

1168
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,830
It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and

1169
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:33,119
I have more than once taken advantage of

1170
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,369
it.

1171
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,400
In the case of the Darlington substitution

1172
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,400
scandal it was of use to me, and also in

1173
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,830
the Arnsworth Castle business.

1174
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:44,099
A married woman grabs at her baby; an

1175
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,639
unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.

1176
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,150
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-

1177
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,460
day had nothing in the house more precious

1178
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,130
to her than what we are in quest of.

1179
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,230
She would rush to secure it.

1180
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,130
The alarm of fire was admirably done.

1181
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,140
The smoke and shouting were enough to shake

1182
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,910
nerves of steel.

1183
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,350
She responded beautifully.

1184
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,459
The photograph is in a recess behind a

1185
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,160
sliding panel just above the right bell-

1186
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,310
pull.

1187
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:15,729
She was there in an instant, and I caught a

1188
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,640
glimpse of it as she half-drew it out.

1189
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,300
When I cried out that it was a false alarm,

1190
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,269
she replaced it, glanced at the rocket,

1191
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,340
rushed from the room, and I have not seen

1192
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:26,899
her since.

1193
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,010
I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped

1194
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,510
from the house.

1195
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,780
I hesitated whether to attempt to secure

1196
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,260
the photograph at once; but the coachman

1197
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,520
had come in, and as he was watching me

1198
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,410
narrowly it seemed safer to wait.

1199
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,790
A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

1200
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:47,969
"And now?"

1201
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,570
I asked.

1202
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:52,129
"Our quest is practically finished.

1203
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,540
I shall call with the King to-morrow, and

1204
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:57,289
with you, if you care to come with us.

1205
00:48:57,289 --> 00:48:59,159
We will be shown into the sitting-room to

1206
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,860
wait for the lady, but it is probable that

1207
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,009
when she comes she may find neither us nor

1208
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:05,640
the photograph.

1209
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,290
It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty

1210
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:12,309
to regain it with his own hands."

1211
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:14,949
"And when will you call?"

1212
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,280
"At eight in the morning.

1213
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,270
She will not be up, so that we shall have a

1214
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,680
clear field.

1215
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,050
Besides, we must be prompt, for this

1216
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:25,429
marriage may mean a complete change in her

1217
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,950
life and habits.

1218
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,750
I must wire to the King without delay."

1219
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,940
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped

1220
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,070
at the door.

1221
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:35,939
He was searching his pockets for the key

1222
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,710
when someone passing said:

1223
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,710
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

1224
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,680
There were several people on the pavement

1225
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,920
at the time, but the greeting appeared to

1226
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,550
come from a slim youth in an ulster who had

1227
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:49,719
hurried by.

1228
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,360
"I've heard that voice before," said

1229
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,249
Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street.

1230
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,760
"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could

1231
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,090
have been."

1232
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:03,759
III.

1233
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,390
I slept at Baker Street that night, and we

1234
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,820
were engaged upon our toast and coffee in

1235
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,329
the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed

1236
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:12,969
into the room.

1237
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,490
"You have really got it!" he cried,

1238
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,020
grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder

1239
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,720
and looking eagerly into his face.

1240
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,210
"Not yet."

1241
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,210
"But you have hopes?"

1242
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,980
"I have hopes."

1243
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,170
"Then, come.

1244
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,850
I am all impatience to be gone."

1245
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:31,549
"We must have a cab."

1246
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:34,019
"No, my brougham is waiting."

1247
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,600
"Then that will simplify matters."

1248
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,559
We descended and started off once more for

1249
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,089
Briony Lodge.

1250
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:45,759
"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

1251
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,720
"Married!

1252
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,990
When?"

1253
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,820
"Yesterday."

1254
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:51,779
"But to whom?"

1255
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,870
"To an English lawyer named Norton."

1256
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:56,229
"But she could not love him."

1257
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:59,880
"I am in hopes that she does."

1258
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,880
"And why in hopes?"

1259
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,220
"Because it would spare your Majesty all

1260
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,570
fear of future annoyance.

1261
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,190
If the lady loves her husband, she does not

1262
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,770
love your Majesty.

1263
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,120
If she does not love your Majesty, there is

1264
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:16,039
no reason why she should interfere with

1265
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,559
your Majesty's plan."

1266
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,359
"It is true.

1267
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,249
And yet--Well!

1268
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,080
I wish she had been of my own station!

1269
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,309
What a queen she would have made!"

1270
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:29,629
He relapsed into a moody silence, which was

1271
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,350
not broken until we drew up in Serpentine

1272
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:33,629
Avenue.

1273
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,270
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an

1274
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,870
elderly woman stood upon the steps.

1275
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:41,229
She watched us with a sardonic eye as we

1276
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,930
stepped from the brougham.

1277
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,710
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

1278
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,250
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion,

1279
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,820
looking at her with a questioning and

1280
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:55,369
rather startled gaze.

1281
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:56,009
"Indeed!

1282
00:51:56,609 --> 00:51:58,849
My mistress told me that you were likely to

1283
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:59,869
call.

1284
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:01,769
She left this morning with her husband by

1285
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:04,600
the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the

1286
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:05,999
Continent."

1287
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,040
"What!"

1288
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,449
Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with

1289
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,660
chagrin and surprise.

1290
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,920
"Do you mean that she has left England?"

1291
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,760
"Never to return."

1292
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,120
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely.

1293
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,449
"All is lost."

1294
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,180
"We shall see."

1295
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:27,459
He pushed past the servant and rushed into

1296
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,640
the drawing-room, followed by the King and

1297
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,120
myself.

1298
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:32,819
The furniture was scattered about in every

1299
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:35,559
direction, with dismantled shelves and open

1300
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,009
drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly

1301
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,840
ransacked them before her flight.

1302
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,280
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a

1303
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,010
small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his

1304
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,910
hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.

1305
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,540
The photograph was of Irene Adler herself

1306
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,619
in evening dress, the letter was

1307
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:58,369
superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To

1308
00:52:58,369 --> 00:52:59,689
be left till called for."

1309
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,600
My friend tore it open and we all three

1310
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,119
read it together.

1311
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,229
It was dated at midnight of the preceding

1312
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,920
night and ran in this way:

1313
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,990
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really

1314
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,690
did it very well.

1315
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,010
You took me in completely.

1316
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,530
Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a

1317
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,730
suspicion.

1318
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,980
But then, when I found how I had betrayed

1319
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,340
myself, I began to think.

1320
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,939
I had been warned against you months ago.

1321
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,470
I had been told that if the King employed

1322
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,470
an agent it would certainly be you.

1323
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,010
And your address had been given me.

1324
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,720
Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what

1325
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,670
you wanted to know.

1326
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,910
Even after I became suspicious, I found it

1327
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,890
hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old

1328
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,260
clergyman.

1329
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,720
But, you know, I have been trained as an

1330
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,580
actress myself.

1331
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:57,139
Male costume is nothing new to me.

1332
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,080
I often take advantage of the freedom which

1333
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:00,469
it gives.

1334
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,470
I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,

1335
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,350
ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes,

1336
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:09,429
as I call them, and came down just as you

1337
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,950
departed.

1338
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,589
"Well, I followed you to your door, and so

1339
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,899
made sure that I was really an object of

1340
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,580
interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock

1341
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:19,829
Holmes.

1342
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:23,539
Then I, rather imprudently, wished you

1343
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:25,739
good-night, and started for the Temple to

1344
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,610
see my husband.

1345
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:29,609
"We both thought the best resource was

1346
00:54:29,609 --> 00:54:32,419
flight, when pursued by so formidable an

1347
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,610
antagonist; so you will find the nest empty

1348
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:36,739
when you call to-morrow.

1349
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,140
As to the photograph, your client may rest

1350
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,570
in peace.

1351
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:44,349
I love and am loved by a better man than

1352
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:44,599
he.

1353
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:47,379
The King may do what he will without

1354
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,250
hindrance from one whom he has cruelly

1355
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:49,850
wronged.

1356
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,740
I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to

1357
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,010
preserve a weapon which will always secure

1358
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,180
me from any steps which he might take in

1359
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,230
the future.

1360
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,510
I leave a photograph which he might care to

1361
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:06,180
possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock

1362
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:06,740
Holmes,

1363
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,550
"Very truly yours, "IRENE NORTON, née

1364
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,479
ADLER."

1365
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,190
"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the

1366
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,680
King of Bohemia, when we had all three read

1367
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,170
this epistle.

1368
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,580
"Did I not tell you how quick and resolute

1369
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,069
she was?

1370
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:28,039
Would she not have made an admirable queen?

1371
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,379
Is it not a pity that she was not on my

1372
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,760
level?"

1373
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,089
"From what I have seen of the lady she

1374
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:36,839
seems indeed to be on a very different

1375
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,929
level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly.

1376
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:42,809
"I am sorry that I have not been able to

1377
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:45,029
bring your Majesty's business to a more

1378
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:47,439
successful conclusion."

1379
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,620
"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the

1380
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:53,869
King; "nothing could be more successful.

1381
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:56,419
I know that her word is inviolate.

1382
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,710
The photograph is now as safe as if it were

1383
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,370
in the fire."

1384
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:04,829
"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

1385
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,729
"I am immensely indebted to you.

1386
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,890
Pray tell me in what way I can reward you.

1387
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,910
This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake

1388
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,040
ring from his finger and held it out upon

1389
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,399
the palm of his hand.

1390
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,210
"Your Majesty has something which I should

1391
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,140
value even more highly," said Holmes.

1392
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,390
"You have but to name it."

1393
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,660
"This photograph!"

1394
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,120
The King stared at him in amazement.

1395
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,229
"Irene's photograph!" he cried.

1396
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,670
"Certainly, if you wish it."

1397
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:38,680
"I thank your Majesty.

1398
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,580
Then there is no more to be done in the

1399
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:41,549
matter.

1400
00:56:41,549 --> 00:56:44,169
I have the honour to wish you a very good-

1401
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:44,590
morning."

1402
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,740
He bowed, and, turning away without

1403
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,500
observing the hand which the King had

1404
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,160
stretched out to him, he set off in my

1405
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,600
company for his chambers.

1406
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,109
And that was how a great scandal threatened

1407
00:56:57,109 --> 00:57:00,149
to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how

1408
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,230
the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were

1409
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,750
beaten by a woman's wit.

1410
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,020
He used to make merry over the cleverness

1411
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,710
of women, but I have not heard him do it of

1412
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,960
late.

1413
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:14,449
And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when

1414
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,420
he refers to her photograph, it is always

1415
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,290
under the honourable title of the woman.

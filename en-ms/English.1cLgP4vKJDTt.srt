Episode 1

3
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,867
Oh Ha Ni?

4
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:12,933
Oh Ha Ni?!

5
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,071
Yes?

6
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:32,567
What are you thinking about so early in the morning?

7
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:35,007
Children, studying is tough, isn't it?

8
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,833
Yeah...

9
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,009
Is it tough?!

10
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,003
Yes!

11
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:44,073
I know, what it means to beliving as a senior in South Korea.

12
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:46,006
How lonely and hard it is...

13
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:50,967
Stop digging through your bag!

14
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,007
Erase those fake eyes!

15
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:58,468
However, even if you guyscomplain about how difficult it is...

16
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:01,765
Could it compare to the stressthird year teachers have to endure?!

17
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:28,816
Do you know the bitter taste of the teaching organization!!

18
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:31,051
Seems our grades are out, right?

19
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:32,392
That's right.

20
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:42,191
We're probably placed last again. It's not the first time. I don't understand why she gets so upset every time.

21
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:45,813
Your house construction is done right? You're not going to have a house-warming party?

22
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:49,537
I haven't been able to unpack and organize any of my things.

23
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:53,313
My dad comes home late every day and so do I.

24
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:59,977
Have Bong Joon Gu do it for you.Earlier, he was staring at you like this.

25
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:00,465
No!!

26
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,369
If it's no, then what else is it?

27
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:08,917
He even joined the art club because of you.

28
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,262
Don't you ever get tired of it?

29
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,536
What...this?

30
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:20,035
Hey, if the daughter of a pork hock restaurant getstired of them, then who else would come and eat it?

31
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:26,564
Ha Ni, are you tired of eating noodles?I mean does the daughter of a noodle restaurant get tired of eating noodles?

32
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,677
I don't get tired of my dad's noodles.

33
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:32,021
Your restaurant's noodles are really tasty! I approve, I approve!

34
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,006
Agree!

35
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,132
Hi!

36
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:37,153
Hi!

37
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:39,776
Heya?

38
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:43,259
Did she just greet us like that?

39
00:07:43,259 --> 00:08:42,726
Huh? What is this? Why isn't it coming out?

40
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:47,091
Thank you.

41
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:47,857
Thank you...?

42
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,294
The senior mid-term exams,Baek Seung Jo Oppa got first place again

43
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:57,041
Is first place a big deal?A perfect score! He got 500/500.

44
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,489
What? Baek Seung Jo got 100% again?

45
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,486
Is he human?

46
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:07,185
I said he wasn't human.

47
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:13,028
He's a spirit. "Spirit of the Forest".

48
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:16,882
So, I was following this white horse and then...

49
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:23,741
It disappeared and suddenly it reappeared!

50
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:29,367
Seriously... How should I say this?

51
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,006
It's the kind of beauty you want to take a bite out of!

52
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:33,467
Take a bite?!

53
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:39,267
That's when I realized what a vampire must feel like.

54
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:43,267
Maybe in the beginningvampires were like that too.

55
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:51,367
The neck of the girl he loved wasso very white and so very beautiful...

56
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:56,667
He had no choice but to bite her!

57
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:59,433
Really Ha Ni, just takea bite of this pig foot.

58
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,367
Hey! I'm not making this up!

59
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,167
Okay, so just eat this.

60
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:34,633
Bite this, here, here!

61
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,867
Seung Jo oppa...

62
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:45,933
You can have this, I just bought it.

63
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:50,319
My mom told me to tell your mom that she says hi.

64
00:10:50,319 --> 00:11:00,633
I'm Jang Mi. Hong Jang Mi.My mom and your mom are close.

65
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:03,333
Oh my! It's not working again.

66
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,645
Ha Ni sunbae!

67
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:09,333
It's not coming out!

68
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,029
That sunbae helped me get this.

69
00:11:13,029 --> 00:12:21,433
Ha Ni Sunbae, hurry up!

70
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:28,367
Here you go, Oppa.

71
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:32,139
Oppa, you got a perfect score this time too, right? Wow! You're the best!

72
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,834
Ha Ni!

73
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,993
Oh Ha Ni!

74
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,365
Oh Ha Ni!!

75
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,385
OH!

76
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:39,267
HA!

77
00:12:39,267 --> 00:13:24,152
NI!

78
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:29,608
That's why you should just confess.

79
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,998
Confess?

80
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:38,339
We're going to be graduating soon.How long are you going to be like this?

81
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,024
Oh! It's because I haven't confessed.

82
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:47,007
Since he doesn't know how I feel,that's why he can't express himself towards me.

83
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:52,085
Because he's shy.

84
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,002
What are you looking up?

85
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:56,195
I'm looking up the word "shy".

86
00:13:56,195 --> 00:14:00,282
Alright, I got it.

87
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:04,369
I'll confess in a wonderful way.

88
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,273
But, how should I do it?

89
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:09,477
I want it to be very impressive.

90
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:18,974
How about this? "My precious Seung Jo, I love you."

91
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:21,946
Oh...that's not bad!

92
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:26,059
Not bad!? What the heck!

93
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:27,287
What are you looking up?

94
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,841
I'm looking up the words "not bad."

95
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,559
Don't you have any good ideas?

96
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,946
You read a lot of books.

97
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:40,986
When animals confess, they dance.

98
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,355
Dance?

99
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:54,547
Fish, birds, and penguins, too, and even drosophila. They all the dance...the "Courtship Dance."

100
00:14:54,547 --> 00:16:27,002
Courtship dance?

101
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:31,042
Aish.

102
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,487
Oh my! We meet again.

103
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:36,072
Yep. We're examining a real life model today, right?

104
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:41,042
As a senior, shouldn't you be studying?

105
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:47,053
Yeah! We don't do stuff like studying.

106
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:48,052
Is your throat okay?

107
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,187
It seemed like your throat was going to rip back there.

108
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,287
Hey!

109
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:53,453
Don't.

110
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:56,687
However, won't it be hard?

111
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,015
Um?

112
00:16:58,015 --> 00:16:59,053
What is?

113
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:14,153
Nothing.

114
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:16,062
Oh.

115
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:19,287
Seung Jo...

116
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,953
...likes girls with big breasts too?

117
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:22,082
Of course.

118
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,987
Isn't Seung Jo Oppa a man too?

119
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:26,953
But why is Joon Gu Oppa not here yet?

120
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:38,186
He knows he is going to model for us today, right?

121
00:17:38,186 --> 00:18:20,153
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

122
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:20,987
What's that?

123
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:22,953
What what what's that?

124
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:25,153
Move it!

125
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,022
What's this?

126
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,887
It's a chiacken.

127
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,082
Chiacken?

128
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:32,153
What's chiacken?

129
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,082
Chicken, a chicken.

130
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:35,587
Oh!

131
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,053
It's Samgyetang! (Korean chicken soup)

132
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:41,012
This is Samgye...

133
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:43,653
This is for you.

134
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,653
Why are you giving it to me?

135
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:47,987
Look at you! You are so thin.

136
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:49,387
Joon Gu Oppa!

137
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,387
Hurry up and get ready, we don't have time to waste.

138
00:18:51,387 --> 00:19:01,987
Alright, alright!

139
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:11,072
You eat it all!

140
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:13,987
Lower your waist a little bit more.

141
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,653
And arm higher...

142
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,053
Raise your leg a little.

143
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:21,253
Huh?

144
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:22,487
A little bit more...

145
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:23,387
Like this?

146
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:24,687
No, a little bit more.

147
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,187
This?!

148
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:28,153
Stop!

149
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:31,853
Okay, today's concept is capturing movement.

150
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:57,587
Okay then... Let's start.

151
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,853
<i>Ahh my joints are in pain!

152
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:02,052
<i>I feel like I'm gonna die,

153
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:06,953
<i>but look! Ha Ni is looking at me right now.

154
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:10,072
<i>Ha Ni is drawing me.

155
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,987
<i>This kind of pain

156
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:15,092
<i>is nothing! A man who is in love

157
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,753
<i>doesn't know how to give up!

158
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:41,153
[Confess... Courtship dance... Gollum..?? ♡]

159
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:41,953
What kind of bastard...

160
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:46,787
Goodness...

161
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:52,012
Can you still laugh when looking at this, Ms. Song Gang Yi?

162
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:56,853
Mr. Song Ji Ho's class has a lot of white stickers over here...

163
00:20:56,853 --> 00:21:02,587
And where there are a lot of blue stickers......represents your students, Ms. Song Gang Yi.

164
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,725
It's so very blue, isn't it?!

165
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,032
You're right. It's like an ocean.

166
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,072
Teacher Song!!

167
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,082
Yes?

168
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:14,287
Ah...not Mr. Song, but Ms. Song. (same family name)

169
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:18,653
Teacher Song Gang Yi, your class is bringing down the entire school's average grades!

170
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,487
These kids right here!

171
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,062
Oh Ha Ni, Dok Go Mi Na, Jung Ju Ri, and Bong Jun Gu!

172
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:25,087
Do something with at least these four rascals.

173
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,653
Might as well not allow them to take the test!

174
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,787
They are such an embarrassment!

175
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:35,387
Embarrassment!

176
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:41,087
That such an intelligent student like Baek Seung Jo was able to attend our school...

177
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:49,002
I am truly grateful.

178
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:50,092
Now, for the finishing touches.

179
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:54,687
You know that if you add some details to the muscles it will look more realistic, right?

180
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,002
Joon Gu Oppa, you can come down now.

181
00:21:57,002 --> 00:22:04,553
Oh, okay.

182
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,002
Ouch!

183
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:08,553
Ahhh!

184
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:12,022
My leg, my leg!

185
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,053
I feel like I'm going to die.

186
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:19,256
Oh, right there!

187
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,353
That's good, good!

188
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:24,002
Ha Ni Sunbae!

189
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:25,153
Yes?

190
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:26,072
Why?

191
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,687
What?

192
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:33,042
What's going on?

193
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:35,453
Huh?!

194
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,838
What's this?

195
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:51,987
Do I look like this?

196
00:22:51,987 --> 00:23:11,088
[So Pal Bok Guksoo] (Korean noodles)

197
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,014
Ha Ni! Check!

198
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:13,747
Oh, okay.

199
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:14,314
Check, please.

200
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:46,084
Yes. Enjoy your meal.

201
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:50,014
We can let them dry all nightand take them down tomorrow.

202
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:52,582
I just can't tell.

203
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,018
I've seen you do this since I was a baby.

204
00:23:55,018 --> 00:24:00,747
Ah, when you were little, the roof was open.

205
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:10,997
But nowadays people don't like it aired outside, because the air is bad.

206
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:13,068
When I was a baby, we used to air it outside.

207
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,777
Right?

208
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:18,014
Huh?

209
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:19,471
Did you just say that?

210
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,612
Dad?

211
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:27,012
I guess so...

212
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,447
Dad...

213
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,098
Yes?

214
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:36,028
Dad, how did you show your love to Mom?

215
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:38,014
Show my love?

216
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,614
I mean confess!

217
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:40,008
Huh??

218
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:43,147
I mean... Dad, you know my friend Ju Ri, right?

219
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:43,847
Yes.

220
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:46,048
Well, she's come to like someone,

221
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:51,237
and she's wondering how to confess to him.

222
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:54,068
You see, back then my carwas a complete piece of crap!

223
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:56,053
I took your mom in that car...

224
00:24:56,053 --> 00:25:00,286
...and we sped all around the city!

225
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:04,314
It felt like the car was going to flip over and the tires were about to fall out.

226
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:05,088
Your mom asked, "are you crazy?"

227
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,314
She screamed, telling me to let her out.

228
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:08,763
And then?

229
00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:14,647
So as I drove that car, I yelled right back at her.

230
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,068
"Do you want to kiss me or do you want to date me?"

231
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:19,038
"Do you want to date me or do you want to live with me?"

232
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,314
"Want to live with me?"

233
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:23,606
"Or do you want to just die with me?!"

234
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,547
And then...

235
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,068
She said she was going to live with you?

236
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,562
No.

237
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:30,538
She asked, "do you wanna die?"

238
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,953
"Don't joke around."

239
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:34,787
What is this?

240
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:41,487
Ha Ni, but she later told me, that she had nearly fallen for me at that point.

241
00:25:41,487 --> 00:28:06,287
Really?

242
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:09,053
Hey Baek Seung Jo.

243
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:14,253
Do you want to kiss me or do you want to date me?

244
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:18,953
Надтай болзох уу эсвэл хамт амьдрах уу?

245
00:28:18,953 --> 00:28:22,092
Do you want to live with me or right over there...

246
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:25,853
Bam!

247
00:28:25,853 --> 00:29:22,053
You want to be buried?

248
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:30,653
Surely...when you're confessing...a thought out letter works best.

249
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:31,553
Letter?

250
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:34,012
Yeah.

251
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:39,053
Something like a love letter.

252
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,002
Dad!

253
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:41,052
See you at home later!

254
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,032
Unnie! Good work!

255
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,032
Ha Ni! Clean your room!

256
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,012
Oh... no...

257
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:47,082
I'm sorry.

258
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,062
It's okay.

259
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:54,487
Aigoo.

260
00:29:54,487 --> 00:29:59,002
Did she find a crush?

261
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:03,887
<i>I want to marry you, accept my heart.<i>

262
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:09,053
<i>Playful Kiss~

263
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:33,853
[Baek Seung Jo]

264
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:37,042
Still no reply?

265
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,052
You wrote your name?

266
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,022
Yeah.

267
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,553
And your phone number?

268
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:45,653
Yeah.

269
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:49,787
But I don't think he will call.

270
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:52,082
Well, you never know. There's always texting.

271
00:30:52,082 --> 00:30:57,053
Maybe he didn't see it yet.

272
00:30:57,053 --> 00:31:02,987
Oh!

273
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:03,753
He's coming this way!

274
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:05,012
What do I do?

275
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:14,887
Did he see you? He might be here for you.

276
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:17,062
Maybe he didn't read the letter?

277
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:19,953
Maybe he didn't see Ha Ni?

278
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:21,353
Right?

279
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:22,586
Ha Ni!!!

280
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,253
Oh Ha Ni!

00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,186
Oh Ha Ni!

282
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,787
OH HA NI!!!

283
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:29,353
Oh Ha...

284
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,987
What should I do?

285
00:31:30,987 --> 00:31:32,653
Ha Ni!!!

286
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:33,987
Oh Ha Ni!!!

287
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:38,022
Oh... Ha...

288
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:44,453
He's just leaving?

289
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:45,062
Ha Ni!

290
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,082
Oh Ha Ni!

291
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,387
OH HA NI!

292
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:51,453
Leave it. Stop.

293
00:31:51,453 --> 00:32:00,062
Oh Ha Ni?

294
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:07,387
Are you Oh Ha Ni?

295
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:12,487
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!

296
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:15,082
Ah Oppa!

297
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:37,332
Where is he? Where is he?

298
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,164
I wasn't expecting a reply.

299
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:45,087
Thanks.

300
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,648
Should I read it now?

301
00:32:47,648 --> 00:33:07,187
Right here?

302
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:08,387
Hey, Hong Jang Mi.

303
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,002
- Hey, Hong Jang Mi, you better give that back! - What is this?

304
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:14,012
Is this a love letter to Seung Jo oppa?

305
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:16,087
- Aren't you going to stop that?! - But what is this?!

306
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:20,187
Oh my! He fixed her grammar mistakes!

307
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:22,887
It's not a love letter. It's an exam paper! An exam!

308
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:26,092
Score D-!

309
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:29,549
"Truthfully, I don't call you Seung Jo."

310
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:35,133
"I call you the 'Spirit of the Forest.'"

311
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,853
Oh my God, she called him a Spirit of the Forest!

312
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:50,253
- "If you ask why..." - What the hell are you doing?!

313
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,687
I shouldn't really have gone to such an extent...

314
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:53,787
but...

315
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:55,059
But?

316
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,742
But what?

317
00:33:57,742 --> 00:34:02,553
I absolutely hate stupid girls.

318
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:10,153
Where are you going!?!

319
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:13,653
Apologize!

320
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:14,753
You're laughing?

321
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:15,953
Is this funny to you?

322
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,587
Do you mind moving?

323
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:21,587
Чи дүлий юм уу. Уучлалт гуй?

324
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:24,022
What do I have to apologize for?

325
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,053
For correcting her mistakes?

326
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:27,253
This little bastard...

327
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,452
Hey hey hey!!!

328
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:32,553
Do you only see mistakes in this?

329
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:39,587
You should be looking at the substance of it, not the words.The feelings she put into it!

330
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:47,002
Ah, you punk, you're going to keep on doing that, huh?

331
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,082
Let's do this.

332
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:56,587
Don't just stand there, come at me!

333
00:34:56,587 --> 00:34:58,687
Did you see that?

334
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,082
What? Scared? Are you scared!?

335
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:09,487
- Hey, come. Come! Bring it!- Come? Come? Come for what?!

336
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:13,287
Bong Joon Gu, you! Come into my office right now!

337
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:21,287
- But Vice Principal, that isn't it. Please listen to me.- Listen. Listen to what?

338
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:25,253
Seung Jo, don't worry about this. Go and study.

339
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:30,022
Don't hang around with this fool.

340
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:36,487
The top 4% is in red. Orange is the top 11%.Yellow has been the same for four years.

341
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:40,953
Green is just there to makethe other students look better.

342
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:44,787
You guys are violet.You are the embarrassment of the school.

343
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:51,287
That's what the Vice Principal said.

344
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:56,012
There are 50 spots for study hall this month.They're just numbers.

345
00:35:56,012 --> 00:36:00,453
But I'm sure you realize that those numberssignify the highest ranked students, right?

346
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:06,587
I don't know how you can sit there laughing, writingsuch useless things when that list is right here.

347
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:10,022
Are you stupid or just thick skinned?

348
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:17,002
Regretably, I despise girls that are stupid whether or not they're thick skinned...

349
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:35,887
...they disgust me.

350
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:40,042
<i>[Baek Seung Jo]</i>

351
00:36:40,042 --> 00:37:00,082
<i>[Oh Ha Ni]</i>

352
00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:03,587
Stop running!

353
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:07,853
Will you stop running already?!

354
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:15,072
Hey, what are you doing? You're already on your 34th lap.

355
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:18,687
Two more.

356
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:22,487
Two more laps.

357
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,002
What is this? Is she training for a marathon or something?

358
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:28,653
Why is she running so much?

359
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:32,787
Let her be. Ha Ni likes running.

360
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:41,787
I suppose. If you could go to university by running long distances, Oh Ha Ni would be in the lead.

361
00:37:41,787 --> 00:38:18,753
You're right. My specialty is doing anything...for a long period of time.

362
00:38:18,753 --> 00:38:54,753
Even if I have to crawl, I'll get there.

363
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,042
Me too.

364
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,192
Let's go!

365
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:09,887
Last lap, let's go!

366
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:14,153
It's her, it's her! The one who confessed to Baek Seung Jo and got rejected!

367
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:17,153
I heard she was humiliated and she wasn't even pretty.

368
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,062
<i> I don't understand women like her...

369
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:22,002
<i>I know!

370
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:23,082
Seung Jo Oppa is ours though.

371
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:41,287
- Hey, Oh Ha Ni, Oh Ha Ni...- What?! Oh Ha Ni. What?

372
00:39:41,287 --> 00:39:42,853
Auntie, it's too much.

373
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:51,487
You have to eat a lot to gain strength. How else are you going to live?

374
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:55,387
Still she's very optimistic. If it were me, I don't think I would be able to come to school.

375
00:39:55,387 --> 00:40:14,653
You say so? She's a senior yet she still doesn't know how to write Korean. Aigoo, how frustrating.

376
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:17,487
Ha Ni! The two story house is really nice!!

377
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:22,072
Where did the scissors go?

378
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:26,002
Ummm... should be...

379
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:42,062
It's here.

380
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:45,353
Ha Ni!

381
00:40:45,353 --> 00:40:50,553
Do you know how old this table is?

382
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:55,287
Grandma gave it to you when you opened the noodle shop; it's older than me.

383
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,387
That's right! The table is 21 years old!

384
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:07,187
There's not even a scratch! It's really sturdy!

385
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:21,287
When you were little...you played in here...

386
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:29,495
Jjan~! (Surprise!)

387
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:37,253
Ha Ni. It's a two story house. You sang a song about two story houses, so how do you like it?

388
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:39,753
I like it.

389
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:41,062
What's going on?

390
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:42,092
You didn't do well?

391
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:43,553
What do you mean?

392
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:48,953
Aah... that... let...

393
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:53,453
Nothing.

394
00:41:53,453 --> 00:41:59,487
Aigooo~

395
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:01,987
This was here!

396
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:04,027
Here, look at this!

397
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:06,487
It's super cute right?

398
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:10,487
You were this small when you were a year old.

399
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,987
You've grown up so much.

400
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,187
But you are like this, rebellious now!

401
00:42:15,187 --> 00:42:17,587
I am not!

402
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:20,453
My hand is similar to Mom's hand.

403
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:21,553
Right?

404
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:23,987
Huh?

405
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:39,587
Yes.

406
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:47,012
Dad.

407
00:42:47,012 --> 00:42:48,087
Ha Ni~

408
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:49,553
We're here!

409
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:50,492
I'm here too!

410
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:54,032
Hurry up! I'm so hungry that I might die!

411
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,387
Wow, it's to die for!

412
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:58,556
Wow! This is just great!

413
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:01,953
Wow, is this your room?

414
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:04,687
It's so close! Right?! Right?!

415
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:08,153
Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?

416
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,387
Wow, this is great!

417
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:14,012
It's so great here.

418
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:19,087
Ha Ni, your house is awesome! Two story house!

419
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:21,687
For me, I like this the best!

420
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:24,092
Ha Ni! Is this your foot?

421
00:43:24,092 --> 00:43:25,653
Yes.

422
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:29,753
It's so cute.

423
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:31,353
Hey!! Stop that! Bong Joon Gu!

424
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:33,487
- Why? - Come on, kids! Ha Ni, get that.

425
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,153
- Yes. - I will get that.

426
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,253
I will get it.

427
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:40,287
It smells great!

428
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:43,002
Wow, it looks so good.Aigoo.

429
00:43:43,002 --> 00:43:45,753
There wasn't much time so I didn't prepare much food.

430
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:48,487
When did you prepare all this?This is a lot!

431
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:50,553
This is a feast!

432
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:51,092
Is that right?

433
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:58,387
We're having guests from Busan today so the main menu is Busan's Mil-myun (Busan's local noodles).

434
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:02,053
How did you know? It's my favorite.

435
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:04,062
Wah. Thank you, dad!

436
00:44:04,062 --> 00:44:12,987
- I'll eat well! - I'll eat well!!

437
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:13,082
Father!

438
00:44:13,082 --> 00:44:14,453
Hmm?

439
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:16,053
It's to die for.

440
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:16,082
To die for?

441
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:21,353
Yes, I ate Busan's Mil-myun for a long time!

442
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:22,887
But this is the best.

443
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:26,082
The noodles are soft yet so chewy!

444
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:28,596
It seems like you know something.

445
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:33,287
Yes, Father. You can't tell, but my tongue is very sensitive.

446
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:38,052
At last year's festival, Joon Gu made and sold Dduk Bok Gi. It was really good.

447
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,887
He's different than he looks.

448
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,092
Well, appearance-wise your face looks like a bear's feet...

449
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:45,012
Beer feet?

450
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:48,096
What? You didn't know?

451
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:51,353
Eat up...

452
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:54,002
But why is the store named So Pal Bok Noodles?

453
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:59,072
Ha Ni's grandma is So Pal Bok, so that's why we used it.

454
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,753
You mean you carried on the family business?

455
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,753
That's right!

456
00:45:04,753 --> 00:45:10,087
My mother-in-law for 40 years and me for 20 years.

457
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,042
Ohhhh~

458
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:15,853
No wonder. A deep taste like this can't come from an amateur.

459
00:45:15,853 --> 00:45:18,887
True! I learned while being hit.

460
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:21,902
I wish my Ha Ni could carry on this business.

461
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:28,053
She doesn't seem to have the talent for cooking though.

462
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:36,187
Don't worry, Father! Ha Ni and I... will together...do our very best!

463
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:38,453
Hey! What's wrong with you?

464
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:44,687
What? A store that's been around for more than 60 years can't end just like that, right?

465
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:51,653
Yeah, but it's not a bad idea to donate everything back to society either.

466
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:58,553
Father! Now I see you're the kind of person who spits with a smile on your face.

467
00:45:58,553 --> 00:46:04,853
Ha Ni!

468
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:13,853
Oh, Ha Ni!

469
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:23,387
What's this?

470
00:46:23,387 --> 00:46:27,053
Hey, Bong Joon Gu, why are you trying to destroy someone else's home?

471
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:47,072
What are you on about?! This house is very stable.

472
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:49,012
What is this?!

473
00:46:49,012 --> 00:46:50,053
Isn't it an earthquake?

474
00:46:50,053 --> 00:46:51,032
Earthquake?

475
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:52,553
Dad, what are we gonna do?!

476
00:46:52,553 --> 00:47:18,153
It's okay. This is a new house. It's stable... Very safe...

477
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:23,787
Ha Ni!

478
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:26,092
Get out! Father! Quickly!

479
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:51,753
Hurry hurry come on!

480
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:53,012
Ha Ni, are you alright?

481
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:54,187
Wait a minute! Is everyone alright!?

482
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:56,641
Yes!

483
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,448
How could this happen!?

484
00:47:58,448 --> 00:48:00,006
Oh my!

485
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:01,074
That's right! That... that...

486
00:48:01,074 --> 00:48:02,296
That!

487
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:02,787
What?

488
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:04,811
That... that...just wait!

489
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,022
Dad!

490
00:48:06,022 --> 00:48:09,712
No, you can't!

491
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:11,312
Don't!

492
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:12,684
I'll be back quickly!

493
00:48:12,684 --> 00:49:03,907
Don't worry!

494
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:07,083
Dad...

495
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:16,882
Da... Dad!

496
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:21,754
At 5:30 this afternoon, there was a mild earthquake of 2.0 magnitude in Seoul.

497
00:49:21,754 --> 00:49:25,098
It was a tremor that slightly shook windows, however...

498
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:30,596
one house in this area, Yeonhee-dong, has collapsed, as you can see, to the point that it's unrecognizable.

499
00:49:30,596 --> 00:49:33,057
He's still in there! My dad is still in there...

500
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:36,587
<i>As far as we know there is still a person trapped within the collapsed house.

501
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:39,287
<i>The 2.0 magnitude YeonHee-dong earthquake collapse site. The rescue team is...

502
00:49:39,287 --> 00:49:41,077
<i>...now in the process of clearing a path and rescuing the person.

503
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,687
<i>Yes, I believe they're looking to see if anyone is there!!</i>

504
00:49:43,687 --> 00:49:49,151
<i>Yes! We can see someone's coming out from under a table in the living room!

505
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:55,287
Dad! Dad!

506
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:58,012
What do you think this is, Dad!?

507
00:49:58,012 --> 00:50:00,587
Aigoo, I lived!

508
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:04,562
- I'm alive! I'm alive! - Daddy!

509
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:07,287
<i>Of course, there doesn't seem to be any fatal injuries.

510
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:11,484
<i>The police suspect the collapse was caused by poor construction and are investigating the exact cause.</i>

511
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:13,253
Huh!?

512
00:50:13,253 --> 00:50:14,496
Oh Gi Dong?

513
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:21,287
-<i> Thank you. - Goodbye.

514
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:22,944
Aigoo!

515
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:30,092
Here... Huh?

516
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:33,515
What is this?

517
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:35,337
Was our house the only one...

518
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:55,265
...that collapsed?

519
00:50:55,265 --> 00:51:00,987
Oh, really?

520
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:03,087
Hehe... let's go.

521
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:04,052
It's her, her, her.

522
00:51:04,052 --> 00:51:13,253
Gee... What!

523
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:15,987
But, are you staying at a hotel again today?

524
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:19,053
- Yeah.- That must be really expensive.

525
00:51:19,053 --> 00:51:22,052
No, for now we decided to stay at my dad's friend's house.

526
00:51:22,052 --> 00:51:25,453
At least until the house is rebuilt or we find another one.

527
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:27,052
We were contacted because of the newscast.

528
00:51:27,052 --> 00:51:30,387
Oh really? That's really great!

529
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,553
Oh, is it her?

530
00:51:31,553 --> 00:51:42,087
What!?

531
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:43,487
What the heck?

532
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,687
Even pictures now...

533
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,253
You're a total celebrity now.

534
00:51:50,253 --> 00:51:52,053
I'm sorry.

535
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:57,353
Because of this unlucky friend, you guys are suffering a lot.

536
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:18,487
Let's go.

537
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:22,032
<i>Please show your power of love.</i>

538
00:52:22,032 --> 00:52:25,053
<i>Thank you for your help.

539
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:28,253
What are they doing?

540
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:31,853
Of course you guys know about what happened on the news...

541
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:38,587
Our friend, Oh Ha Ni, lost her house overnight due to a sudden earthquake.

542
00:52:38,587 --> 00:52:41,082
<i>Let's all help Ha Ni.

543
00:52:41,082 --> 00:52:43,453
What the heck is that?

544
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:45,653
What is Bong Joon Gu doing?

545
00:52:45,653 --> 00:52:49,253
"Love's Fundraising?"

546
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,487
That idiot!

547
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:54,887
Hey, let's just go this way.

548
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:58,287
Come on, follow me.

549
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,387
<i>Oh! Thank you.

550
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:04,287
<i>Thank you, let's help Ha Ni. We're all friends aren't we?

551
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:08,687
Show us the power of love! Thank you!

552
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:11,032
Oh, Ha Ni, Oh Ha Ni!

553
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:14,387
Ha Ni, Ha Ni, move it, move it, move it!

554
00:53:14,387 --> 00:53:18,012
Hey, everyone, everyone, everyone!

555
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:20,387
Please greet her with thunderous applause.

556
00:53:20,387 --> 00:53:22,042
Even after going through such a horrible experience yesterday,

557
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:26,653
she came to school all determined and ready!

558
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:31,253
Here is Oh Ha Ni! Applause!

559
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:34,787
Ha Ni, Ha Ni!

560
00:53:34,787 --> 00:53:41,153
What. What, what?

561
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:44,082
<i> Now I'm really screwed.<i>

562
00:53:44,082 --> 00:53:51,453
Hey! Hey, you! Show some love, Baek Seung Jo.

563
00:53:51,453 --> 00:53:53,387
Didn't you see the news yesterday?

564
00:53:53,387 --> 00:53:55,052
Don't you have a TV at home?

565
00:53:55,052 --> 00:54:00,187
Whose fault do you think it is that Ha Ni is going through such a difficult time?

566
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:03,253
Wasn't it because of a mild earthquake of 2.0 magnitude?

567
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:05,012
Oh...

568
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:08,353
Right, right...

569
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:11,052
However... Because of that small earthquake...

570
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:14,887
...the newly built house collapsed. What do you think about that?

571
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:16,072
Are you saying that I caused the earthquake?

572
00:54:16,072 --> 00:54:20,042
Then what? Who can cause a bigger earthquake than you?

573
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:27,253
You're capable of causing such a great amount of pain to someone's heart, so capable of causing that.

574
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:29,032
Alright, all I need to do is give you money?

575
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:37,092
Right...

576
00:54:37,092 --> 00:54:43,062
Put your wallet away!

577
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:45,187
Did anyone say they'd take your money?

578
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:48,072
Even if I were homeless, I would never take your money even if you offered.

579
00:54:48,072 --> 00:54:50,187
Really?

580
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:56,052
Fine, I'll respect that.

581
00:54:56,052 --> 00:54:59,042
Hey, Baek Seung Jo!

582
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:01,022
Who made you so mighty that you can ignore people like this?

583
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:04,953
To you, all the kids here look like idiots, don't they?

584
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:08,187
You think that acting superior and ignoring everyone makes you look cool, right?

585
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:09,062
Are you just that much better?

586
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:12,187
Why? Because your IQ is higher?

587
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:18,953
Because you're good at studying, you have a handsome face, and you're tall...

588
00:55:18,953 --> 00:55:26,953
Is everything just dandy if you're better than others?

589
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:30,387
Hey! We can all study and be smart, who can't?

590
00:55:30,387 --> 00:55:33,853
I just don't study, that's why my grades aren't great. Do you think that my grades are bad because I can't study?

591
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:35,072
Really?

592
00:55:35,072 --> 00:55:37,062
Yeah!

593
00:55:37,062 --> 00:55:39,253
Then show me.

594
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:43,887
What? Show you?

595
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:46,042
Ok fine, I'll show you.

596
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,753
During the next examining period.

597
00:55:49,753 --> 00:55:52,153
How much?

598
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:53,052
How much?

599
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:55,487
<i>There are 50 spots for study hall this month.<i>

600
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:58,012
<i> I don't know how you can sit there laughing, writing such useless things. <i>

601
00:55:58,012 --> 00:55:59,552
<i> Don't you have any brains?

602
00:55:59,552 --> 00:56:03,787
<i> Or just thick skinned?

603
00:56:03,787 --> 00:56:05,387
Right! The study hall.

604
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:07,092
Study hall?

605
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:08,092
This month’s study hall?

606
00:56:08,092 --> 00:56:10,072
Yeah!

607
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:14,012
That high and mighty Special Study Hall.

608
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:17,887
Next month, I will get in there.

609
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:20,587
Are you making fun of me again?

610
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:21,887
If I do it?

611
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:23,087
And if I do it? What will you do if I do it?

612
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:23,987
If you do it?

613
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:25,253
Yeah!

614
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:30,987
If you do it, I'll carry you on my back and walk around the school.

615
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,002
<i>You'll give me a piggyback ride?

616
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:35,032
<i>No, that's not it!

617
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:37,087
Fine.

618
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:47,042
You better look forward to it.

619
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,753
Are you really that close?

620
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,002
Ah! Of course!

621
00:56:51,002 --> 00:56:56,453
From the day we were born until we finished junior high, we lived together like one family.

622
00:56:56,453 --> 00:57:04,082
Then we moved up to Seoul and we lost touch.

623
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:11,887
Even when I'm asleep, I feel like bursting with anger because of our house was destroyed.

624
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,052
However, thanks to that...

625
00:57:13,052 --> 00:57:17,153
...finding my friend again is really nice.

626
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:19,032
Oh why this thing!?

627
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:25,092
This thing!

628
00:57:25,092 --> 00:57:30,287
Daddy is like an idiot right?

629
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:35,087
Thanks.

630
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:40,053
<i> Every day with you,

631
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:45,353
<i> Being held in the night's arms.

632
00:57:45,353 --> 00:57:50,353
<i> Every day with you,

633
00:57:50,353 --> 00:58:00,387
<i> I'm hungry to fall asleep.

634
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:03,987
Stop!

635
00:58:03,987 --> 00:58:07,187
It's here. House number 142, right?

636
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:09,353
Oh, you're right.

637
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:21,187
Just wait here.

638
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:25,012
Baek Su Chang, it's right.

639
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:28,687
He must be really rich, your friend.

640
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:37,387
Yeah... It seems like it.

641
00:58:37,387 --> 00:58:38,287
<i>Who is it?

642
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:41,042
I... Hello.

643
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:44,687
I'm Su Chang's friend, Oh Gi Dong.

644
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,052
<i>Oh yes, come on in!

645
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:49,022
<i>Honey!

646
00:58:49,022 --> 00:58:58,687
<i>- You've arrived!?</i> - Yes.

647
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,042
Come on over here, hurry!

648
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:03,187
Baek(white) Piggy!

649
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:05,042
How did you! Aigoo.

650
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,853
You must have suffered a lot.

651
00:59:06,853 --> 00:59:11,938
Aigoo! It's really great to see you!

652
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:13,853
Wow!

653
00:59:13,853 --> 00:59:16,042
- Ah my wife. -Hi there!

654
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:19,953
Oh my, welcome to our home.

655
00:59:19,953 --> 00:59:22,753
Yes... I really am here.

656
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:26,253
It's really great that you're here. You're completely welcome here!

657
00:59:26,253 --> 00:59:27,487
Hi there.

658
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:28,553
Hello.

659
00:59:28,553 --> 00:59:30,052
Oh, you must be Gi Dong's daughter.

660
00:59:30,052 --> 00:59:31,987
Yes.

661
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:36,022
You're more beautiful in person.

662
00:59:36,022 --> 00:59:36,987
Excuse me?

663
00:59:36,987 --> 00:59:40,002
Oh... In all honesty...

664
00:59:40,002 --> 00:59:42,092
I couldn't wait until tonight.

665
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:47,062
I just stopped by in the morning.

666
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:52,062
Oh that...

667
00:59:52,062 --> 00:59:56,187
That was me.

668
00:59:56,187 --> 00:59:58,032
Well... We should unload all your stuff.

669
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:02,953
No, no, we don't have much stuff. Our Ha Ni can do it all by herself.

670
01:00:02,953 --> 01:00:04,253
Yeah! There isn't much.

671
01:00:04,253 --> 01:00:07,022
Oh, don't worry, our child needs to help.

672
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:08,853
No, I said it's alright.

673
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:22,753
Son! Come here and use your muscles!

674
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,053
Dad, here, here. I'll do it

675
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:29,053
Aigoo, just go close the door.

676
01:00:29,053 --> 01:00:31,893
Alright.

677
01:00:31,893 --> 01:00:34,082
Teddy~

678
01:00:34,082 --> 01:00:38,453
From now on, I think our luck will be good.

679
01:00:38,453 --> 01:00:42,087
Don't you think?

680
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:49,887
Let's go.

681
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:50,753
Should I help you?

682
01:00:50,753 --> 01:01:00,153
No, it's alright.

683
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:02,042
<i> Is this a dream? Yeah, this must be a dream!

684
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:09,053
<i>Come to your senses, Oh Ha Ni.

685
01:01:09,053 --> 01:01:13,071
You...you!

686
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:28,453
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

687
01:01:28,453 --> 01:01:33,953
<i>I can't believe it... What should I do?

688
01:01:33,953 --> 01:01:35,187
Who is this?

689
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:36,287
It's Seung Jo.

690
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:39,053
Excuse me!?

691
01:01:39,053 --> 01:01:41,487
Hey! Give me that!

692
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:43,052
I have a proposition.

693
01:01:43,052 --> 01:01:47,002
Hey, Oh Ha Ni, what is "x" here?

694
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:49,287
Alphabet.

695
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:50,787
I feel like I'm going to explode.

696
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:52,653
You as a child~

697
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,053
Hey!

698
01:01:54,053 --> 01:01:58,753
Hello~

699
01:01:58,753 --> 01:02:00,072
Camera!

700
01:02:00,072 --> 01:02:02,022
Don't spread rumors.

701
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:05,002
I... I closed my feelings for you.

702
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,052
My feelings for you...aren't even this much.

703
01:02:07,052 --> 99:59:59,999
Really?

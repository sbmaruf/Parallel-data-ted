1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,150
Round 24,259 to the
nearest hundred.

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,590
You're going to find that
doing these problems are

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,910
pretty straightforward, but
what I want to do is just

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,750
think about what it means to
round to the nearest hundred.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,140
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to draw a number line.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,220
Let me draw a number line here,
and I'm just going to

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,970
mark off the hundreds
on the number line.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:37,290
So maybe we have 24,100, and
then we go to 24,200, then we

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,490
go to 24,300, and then
we go to 24,400.

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,000
I think you see what I
mean when I'm only

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,250
marking off the hundreds.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm going up by increments
of 100.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,130
Now, on this number line,
where is 24,259?

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,200
So if we look at the number
line, it's more than 24,200

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,930
and it's less than 24,300.

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,220
And it's 259, so if this
distance right here is 100, 59

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,300
is right about there, so that
is where our number is.

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,570
That is 24,259.

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,110
So when someone asks you to
round to the nearest hundred,

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,700
they're literally saying round
to one of these increments of

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,370
100 or round to whichever
increment of 100 that it is

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,900
closest to.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,420
And if you look at it right like
this, if you just eyeball

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,760
it, you'll actually see that it
is closer to 24,300 than it

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,220
is to 24,200.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,160
So when you round it,
you round to 24,300.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,890
So if you round to the nearest
hundred, the answer

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,180
literally is 24,300.

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,310
Now that's kind of the
conceptual understanding of

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,230
why it's even called the
nearest hundred.

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,200
The nearest hundred is 24,300.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,870
But every time you do a problem
like this, you don't

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,460
have to draw a number line and
go through this whole process,

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,580
although you might want
to think about it.

35
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,910
An easier process, or maybe a
more mechanical process, is

36
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:14,900
you literally look at
the number 24,259.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,470
We want to round to the nearest
hundred, so you look

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,080
at the hundreds place.

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,860
This is the hundreds place right
here, and when we round,

40
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,130
that means we don't
want any digits.

41
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,650
We only want zeroes after
the hundreds place.

42
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,490
So what you do is you look at
the place one less than the

43
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,510
place you're rounding to.

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,120
This is the hundreds place so
you look at the 5 right there,

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,950
and if this number is 5 or
greater, if it's 5, 6, 7, 8,

46
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,360
or 9, you round up.

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,290
So 5 or greater, you round up.

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,800
And so rounding up in this
situation, it is 5.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
It is 5 or greater, so rounding
up means that we go

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,270
to 24,000, and since we're
rounding up, we make

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,820
the 2 into a 3.

52
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:13,540
We increment it by one, so
rounding up, so 24,300.

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,570
That's what we mean
by rounding up.

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,180
And just as kind of a
counterexample, if I had

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:28,610
24,249 and I wanted to round
to the nearest hundred, I

56
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,580
would say, OK, I want to round
to the nearest hundred.

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,430
Let me look at the tens
place, this place one

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,150
level to the right.

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,745
It is not 5 or greater,
so I will round down.

60
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,640
And when you round
down, be careful.

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,120
It doesn't mean you
decreases this 2.

62
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,700
It literally means you
just only have the 2.

63
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,410
Just get rid of everything
after it.

64
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,820
So it becomes 24,200.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,580
That's the process where
you round down.

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,300
If you round up, it
becomes 24,300.

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,180
And it makes sense.

68
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,410
24,249 is going to be sitting
right over here someplace, so

69
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,730
it's going to be closer
to 24,200.

70
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,310
24,200 would be the nearest
hundred when we round

71
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,470
down in this case.

72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,390
For the case of the problem,
24,259, the

73
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,140
nearest hundred is 24,300.

74
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,970
We round up.

1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:02,481
Google Search is incredibly powerful.

2
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:05,026
You can search for text across the Internet

3
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:07,611
most of human knowledge, images, books, videos.

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:09,697
But, we realized there was an important part

5
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:11,532
of the Search experience that we’d overlooked.

6
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:13,002
Our task as designers

7
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:14,007
is to get our users the information

8
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:15,053
they’re looking for

9
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:18,008
as quickly and as beautifully as possible.

10
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:19,083
But, until now, we couldn’t always

11
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,459
give users what they’re looking for

12
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:25,838
Because, sometimes, they’re not looking at all.

13
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:27,042
My wife and I have a puppy

14
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,063
with so much energy

15
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:30,017
that we walk her 5 times a day,

16
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:32,047
and she sniffs around every nook and cranny.

17
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:35,181
This is how she gets information about her world.

18
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:37,975
Photo-auditory-olfactory sensory convergence

19
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,035
is a phenomenon that's been promised

20
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,103
in science fiction for decades.

21
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:43,039
-We’re excited to announce Google NoseBeta

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,044
our flagship olfactory knowledge feature

23
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,086
enabling users to search for smells.

24
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:49,065
Our mobile aroma indexing program

25
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,654
has been able to amass

26
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:52,086
a 15 million scentibite database

27
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:57,995
of smells from around the world.

28
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:59,028
-With an elegant integration

29
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:01,082
into our existing knowledge panels,

30
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:03,025
the Google Nose Beta Smell button

31
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:06,045
seamlessly connects scent to search.

32
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,068
By intersecting photons with infrasound waves,

33
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,425
Google Nose Beta temporarily aligns molecules

34
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,042
to emulate a particular scent.

35
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:16,555
Google Nose Beta works on nearly all desktops,

36
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:17,973
laptops,

37
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:20,351
and quite a few mobile devices.

38
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:22,228
In the fast paced world that we live in,

39
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:23,068
we don’t always have time

40
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,147
to stop and smell the roses.

41
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,691
Now, with Google Nose Beta,

42
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:39,829
the roses are just a click away.

43
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,042
-If you have a question like

44
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,916
"what does a new car smell like?",

45
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,418
who knows the answer?

46
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:46,008
Google Nose.

47
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,017
-What does a ghost smell like?

48
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,505
Google Nose.

49
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:50,756
What does the inside

50
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:52,633
of an Egyptian tomb smell like?

51
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,801
Google Nose.

52
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:54,468
Google Nose.

53
00:01:54,468 --> 99:59:59,000
Google Nose...Beta.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760


2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,570
We're told, solve the absolute
value of 3x minus 9 is equal

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,490
to 0, and graph the solution
on a number line.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,460
So let's just rewrite the
absolute value equation.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,880
They told us that the absolute
value of 3x minus

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,950
9 is equal to 0.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,010
So we're told that the
absolute value of the

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,730
something-- in this case the
something is 3x minus 9-- is

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,840
equal to 0.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,660
If I told you that the absolute
value of something is

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,580
equal to 0, I'm telling you
that something has to be

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,900
exactly 0 away from 0, or 0 away
from the origin on the

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,750
number line.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,850
So the only thing that that
something could be is 0.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,040
If I told you that the absolute
value of x is equal

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,800
to 0, you know that x has
to be equal to 0.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,720
That's the only value whose
absolute value is 0.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,480
So if I told you that the
absolute value of 3x minus 9

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,820
is 0, than we know that 3x minus
9 has to be equal to 0,

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,810
and that's kind of unique about
the 0 is that, it's the

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,060
only number the has a unique,
that's only the

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,800
absolute value of 0.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,980
If you had, say, a 1 here, you
could say, oh well, then this

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,420
thing could be a 1
or a negative 1.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,130
But here, if you have a 0,
this thing can only be 0.

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,632
So solving this equation is
fairly straightforward.

27
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:22,330
If we want to isolate the 3x,
get rid of the negative 9 on

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,180
the left-hand side, we add 9 to
both sides of the equation.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,140
Add 9 to both sides
of the equation,

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,460
these 9's cancel out.

31
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,560
That's the whole point.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,460
On the left-hand side, you're
just left with 3x, and on the

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,350
right-hand side, you are
just left with 9.

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,230
Now we want to solve for x,
so we have 3 times x.

35
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,390
Let's divide it by 3, because 3
times x divided by 3 is just

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,450
going to be x.

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,990
But if we divide the left side
by 3, we have to divide the

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,600
right side by 3.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,232
So we are left with-- these
guys cancel out.

40
00:01:56,232 --> 00:02:00,355
x is equal to 9 over
3, which is 3.

41
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,210
And that's our solution.

42
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,920
Now let's try out.

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Let's make sure that this
actually works.

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,870
Let's substitute it back into
our original equation.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,490
So we have the absolute
value of 3 times x.

46
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,490
Instead of x, I'll just put in
our actual answer that we got,

47
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:21,670
3 times 3 minus 9 has got
to be equal to 0.

48
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,860
So what's this going
to be equal to?

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,390
3 times 3 is 9.

50
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,020
So it's the absolute value of
9 minus 9, which is the

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,130
absolute value of 0, which
is, indeed, 0.

52
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,730
So it does, indeed, equal
0, and we are done.

53
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,066

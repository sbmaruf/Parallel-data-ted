1
00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:02,414
There’s an "edit" button

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,830
Just click on it,

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,660
find the place where the text is, and edit

4
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:09,114
and then click "Save". It’s that easy.

5
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:10,912
The cool thing about Wikipedia,

6
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,233
is that you can change things.

7
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:14,066
You don’t need anybody’s permission

8
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,326
and it’s not hard.

9
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,805
It looks a little bit daunting at first,

10
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,829
but it’s really not hard

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,779
People don’t realise, as though it’s some sort of blindness.

12
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:27,587
People read articles and they don’t see the "edit" button.

13
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:29,725
Click on that button, and see what happens.

14
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,621
"Edit."

15
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,045
When you open yourself to something,

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,430
and you go and start editing,

17
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:38,293
all kinds of other things can happen,

18
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,129
and that’s really beautiful.

19
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,684
Like, it can be just a starting point,

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,139
it’s an invitation for more life, somehow.

21
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:48,019
Whenever we start an article, we don’t like it,

22
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:49,598
because you find it ugly.

23
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:53,617
But wait just... hours

24
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:56,844
and see how it will be developed to a great article.

25
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:59,392
The "edit" button: click it, and change something,

26
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:02,046
save page, you have made a difference to the whole world.

27
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:04,203
"Save".

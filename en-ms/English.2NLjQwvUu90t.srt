1
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:16,394
Batu Caves, preparations are underway for the grandest Hindu Festival of the year.

2
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,646
Thaipusam is about faith, penance and endurance.

3
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:43,630
More than a million Hindu devotees are expected to congregate here, over the next few days.

4
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:52,002
5 days before Thaipusam, we follow a group of 50 devotees from the Sri Muniswarar Temple in Puchong

5
00:00:52,002 --> 00:01:01,480
as they make their climb up the 272 steps, to reach the top of the hill where the temple is located.

6
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:13,929
High priest Vasantha, aged 50 is leading a group of devotees to fulfil their vows, and to seek forgiveness for their sins from Lord Murugan.

7
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:38,963
She has been doing this for the past 20 years, only this year, it is a bit different.

8
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:48,168
To avoid the heavy traffic, due to a long stretch of public holidays, she is starting early.

9
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:54,514
And for many devotees , it is never too early to perform this pilgrimage

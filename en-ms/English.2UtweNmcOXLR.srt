1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,940
you ever feel like it's backpedaling even
though your following the rules?

2
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:15,019
you work long hours tolerated your
boss You get and annual raise and you

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:20,269
try to save money and budget where ever you can
and clearly you're working with no system for financial

4
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,179
success but something is very wrong

5
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,749
the rules are not working the system is
broken down you're barely making ends meet

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,620
let alone getting ahead

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,519
and retirement forget it your living day by day

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,610
You want to build financial security and wealth
but it's just not happening

9
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,500
So where exactly has playing by the rules
Gotten You?

10
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:49,129
So if you can change your outlook

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,960
Change some of your values and change your rules

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,090
You find that there is a whole set of rules out there

13
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:53,249
That are more Conducive for those who want to be rich

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,010
Conducive for those who want to be rich

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,180

information that can set you free

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,920
The story of Rich Dad Poor Dad

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,380
is really a story of two different
fathers with two different sets of

31
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,490
values and completely different sets of
advice
0:01:49.490,0:01:53.000
so i don't mean to insult anybody or

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,200
damage your values really that was the
difference for example Poor Dad

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,910
Always said

34
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,419
go to school

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,790
get good grades

36
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,830
get a high paying job work hard live below your means
save money get out of

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,860
get out of debt

38
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,939
have a good retire plan

39
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,679
That was my Poor Dads Values  my rich
dad said you probably won't get rich

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,740
doing that because very few people get
rich following that plan

41
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,359
But you thought Saving Money Made You Money?

42
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:27,819
You take a look at this forty year run on the Dollar

43
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,949
The Dollar is designed

44
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,070
economically to lose money every single
year

45
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,180
so why would you save something

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,050
that loses money every year

47
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,769
and what this means was somebody on
retirement plans is that after you

48
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,069
retire The value of your dollar
goes down

49
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,589
and the cost of living keeps going up to
my Rich Dad that was bad advice and made

50
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:51,369
no sense again he has different values

51
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,760
this goes against everything you've
heard

52
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,729
it's very important that Diagram my Rich Dad
showed me as a little boy

53
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,079
was a diagram known as a cashflow
quadrant

54
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,389
and the quadrant is made up of the four
different people who make up the world

55
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,899
of business so my rich dad said in the
world of business

56
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,159
there's are E's and E's stand for employees

57
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,219
and employees that you can always tell
who will be our

58
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,139
by their core values and what the
0:03:19.139,0:03:22.870
employee whether the president or the janitor
 of the company will always say the

59
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,780
same words the words are

60
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:27,629
i'm looking for safe secure job with
benefits

61
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,900
that's what makes a them an employees 'cause
our core values are security

62
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,519
the other other one of Four is

63
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,449
the S or the small business owner
of the self-employed

64
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,609
and again their core values will cause
them to use the same words which are

65
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,360
if you want it done right

66
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:44,849
do it by yourself

67
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,139
the S also means are usually Solo

68
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,849
Generally one person act that

69
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,949
tend operate by themselves

70
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,759
on the right side of the quadrant are
the B's

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,570
and rich dad said to be stood for was
big business or like Bill Gates Forbe's

72
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,959
defines big business as five hundred employees
are more

73
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,519
and their words are different the will say

74
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,539
I'm looking for a good system
good network and the smartest people I

75
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,460
know to help run my business and their
unlike the S they don't want to run the

76
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,839
company by themselves they want smart
people to run the companies for them

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,750
and then the fourth of quadrant is the  I
0:04:19.750,0:04:25.169
and I stands for investor these are
people who have money work hard for them

78
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,239
these people are people that people work
hard for them and these were people that

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,640
work hard for the rich

80
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,189
here so early on in my life it was my

81
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:36,489
my poor dad

82
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,110
who all is said to me you know Robert

83
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,630
go to school and get a high paying job

84
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,889
and so my Poor Dad Poor values was to be
an employee he wanted job security

85
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,029
promotions a steady paycheck and all this

86
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,630
and so it was my Rich Dad who said to
me so Robert 

87
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,409
if you really want to be Rich 

88
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,949
learn to build businesses it made more
sense to him to work hard to build a

89
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,799
business something you owned and something
that passed on from generation to

90
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,669
generation to your kids

91
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,469
whereas my poor dad said work hard

92
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,009
but by Rich Dad Said why would you work hard 
for something you'll never own and you can get

93
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:17,109
fired from right away again that was a
difference in values

94
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:21,129
so Rich Dad suggested I learned how to
be a business owner

95
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,969
and learn how to be

96
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,230
an investor

97
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,329
and that's one of the big differences on
this side of the quadrant these people

98
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,940
here were for security

99
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,869
they work for money also

100
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,469
on the side of the here

101
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,090
they're key value that they want is
they want Freedom

102
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,499
they don't want to have to work at a job
anymore that i want to have to work for

103
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,899
the rest of their lives

104
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,870
so the beauty of building a Business and learning 
how to invest is very

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,980
simply

106
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,619
that this is passive income you work
hard for a few years

107
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:57,499
but possibly for the rest your life in
income keeps flowing to you

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,860
Of All the businesses out there which type 
do you choose?

109
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,710
one of the reasons i consider Direct Selling Business

110
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,529
a perfect businesses are simply because

111
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,569
the company will work with you to get
the business skills that make you rich

112
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,629
always remember that is not money that
makes you rich it's business skills and

113
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,359
that's why it's a perfect business they'll work 
take as long as you like 
0:06:20.360,0:06:22.479
to get the skills to make the money

114
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,349
and that's a lifetime skill thing

115
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:27,939
the part about it is too low start-up
costs and where else can you get in for

116
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,289
under five hundred dollars and get these
skills

117
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,719
for people who want to make the shift
over to the B Quadratnt which is what i

118
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,410
recommend for people

119
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,580
one of the beauties of the network
marketing company

120
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,120
is that you can do that

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,080
for a very low price and that's why i
talk to people about considering

122
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
network marketing

123
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,059
if you're to build a microsoft it would take you
 few hundreds of millions of

124
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:56,989
dollars but a network marketing company allows
you to start at a very rate will be

125
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,390
patient within you they'll take their time

126
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,029
to transition over here

127
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,510
and the reason why that time is so
important to most people

128
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,330
is it takes time to change those values

129
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,940
and the most important thing is once you
take the time let's say it takes one year or two

130
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,479
years five years

131
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,379
whatever time the text once you see the
value

132
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,270
for the core values of this side and this
side your unstoppable

133
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:23,669
today i would never go back and get a
job why should i

134
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,509
i'd rather just stay on this side build
companies pay less taxes make for money

135
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,319
but the key as a person needs to change
to values from my Poor Dad to the values 

136
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,459
of my Rich Dad

137
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,680
and that's when the values of network
marketing companies they allow you the time and

138
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,540
and very low cost they'll work with you to make
a transitional over there

139
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,649
the number one asset a person can
build is build a business that is the  smartest thing

140
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,809
you can do

141
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:56,719
you've been told to corporate ladder is the surest route
To your Success

142
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,900
Years ago I decided not to follow
the Corporate Ladder simple because 

143
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,390
again it was values

144
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,969
you know my poor dad always said go to
school and get it high paying job with

145
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,950
the government a big corporation

146
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,169
but my rich dad said why would you
worked so hard at something you'll never

147
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,689
own you can't sell your job you can't pass
it on to your kids

148
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,209
so to me and never made any sense it
made more sense to build my own business

149
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,129
and hire other people

150
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,979
the other reason is that you really
don't have much control if you're in the

151
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,479
corporate ladder world

152
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,519
for example you can get fired at any time
or today we were we have whats Called M&amp;A

153
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,339
Stands for mergers and acquisitions it's when one of
the company buys anther company so you

154
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,079
could be a great employees

155
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,700
but the company that buys your
accomplishes just fires You

156
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,200
wait a minute

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
this sounds too good to be true

158
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,240
Like one of those Get Rich Quick Schemes

159
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,860
It's  not get-rich-quick formula you don't
just do it overnight it takes time

160
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,980
I still remember the first time I made
that transition was back in nineteen

161
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,970
seventy eight

162
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,220
when i fully quit my job

163
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,170
and i had to depend upon my company that
i was building to support me so I

164
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,980
understand the fear

165
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,040
the beauty

166
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,900
the most important thing to remember is
this
0:09:09.900,0:09:12.470
there's two kinds of people in the world

167
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,410
there are the types that will say you'll
never make it

168
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,450
and I had a lot of friends and family saying that

169
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,510
You're stupid don't do it

170
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,770
and the second type

171
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,530
where the people that said go for it  you
can do it

172
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,740
don't worry about it will cover you

173
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,530
so the most important thing is support
of friends and family

174
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,500
One of the beauties direct
selling company

175
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,650
is that they provide that personal
support to you

176
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,599
for as long as it takes you to make the
journey from the left side to my Rich Dad's

177
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,590
Side

178
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,880
You alway thought being self-employed was
living the American dream

179
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,200
one the challenges of being
self-employed is that

180
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,220
your your own boss here Your the solo act

181
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,290
Like in the S Quadrant your the
individual

182
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,800
you do it on your own

183
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,990
whereas in the B Quadrant you're a team
player you have to depend upon your team

184
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,510
and count on your team

185
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,090
So the problem with being an S let's say 
you where in a traffic accident

186
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,420
there goes our income

187
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,960
and let's say you get older and you
haven't set enough money aside to

188
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,990
retire on that means you probably have
to work for the rest of your life

189
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,570
because you don't have anybody else to
fall back on not a team to count on

190
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,170
so one of the problems with the S although
most people say is most satisfying of

191
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,080
all work

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,310
It is a Solo Act and your totally on your own

193
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,269
personally i'd rather be a member of the
team

194
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,260
So they can count on me and I can count
on them

195
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,980
It Sounds like a smart move but change

196
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,190
It's So 

197
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,950
Difficult

198
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,150
We all know the world has changed but
sometimes the hardest thing to change

199
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,130
Is Ourselves

200
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,690
and being an old guys the older I get
sometimes get more set in my ways

201
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,910
and i think that's one of the things that
a direct selling business offers people

202
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,860
why is the perfect business

203
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,940
they allow you to take your time to make
the mental emotional and physical

204
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,720
changes required

205
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,800
to move from the left side to the Rich
Dad side

206
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,770
I think that's a big thing it's a very
gracious It's a very elegant way it's

207
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,300
a patient way of supporting you in
making the changes of your life so

208
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
please remember change always creates
upset

209
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,230
but sometimes we all know

210
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,050
we have to make those changes

211
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,160
and if you know it's time for you to
make that change

212
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,910
than the perfect business may be a
direct selling business for you

213
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,340
direct selling

214
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:41,580
it is quite possibly the perfect business
for you

215
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,200

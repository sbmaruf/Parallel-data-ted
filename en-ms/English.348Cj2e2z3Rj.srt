1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,520
Rewrite the expression
below applying

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,180
the commutative and associative
properties of addition.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,170
And then show that
both expressions

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,080
yield the same result.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,349
So one, we could just evaluate
the expression the way

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:14,890
it's written.

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,348
And then we can
kind of mess around

9
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:19,100
with it using the commutative
and associative properties

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,480
of addition.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,860
So let's first add 17.5 plus 3.

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,450
So that's going to give us 20.5.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,760
So this is going to be 20.5.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,440
And then to that, we're
going to add negative 7.5.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,070
Now, adding negative 7.5
is the exact same thing

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,620
as subtracting 7.5.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,340
So this is going to be equal
to-- the 0.5's cancel out.

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,350
And then 20 minus 7 is 13.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,660
So that's our first way
of getting the answer.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,000
And we kind of adhered
to the parentheses.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,260
Now let's use the
commutative property.

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,910
The commutative
property tells us

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,200
that the order doesn't matter.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,100
We can commute these
numbers around.

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,480
They can move, commute.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,060
It's like you're going to work.

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,190
They can move around.

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,684
So let's just move
the numbers around.

29
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,100
Let's make it--
actually, we could

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,610
do all sorts of crazy things.

31
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,110
We could just change
the order here.

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:26,250
We could make this negative
7.5 plus 17.5 plus 3.

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,582
We could keep the
parentheses, just like that.

34
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,290
So we would have
essentially just changed

35
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,710
the order of this
expression right over here.

36
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,450
But let's use both
the commutative

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,940
and the associative properties.

38
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,260
So now we've commuted
everything around.

39
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,000
And now we can
re-associate everything.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,999
So instead of putting the
parentheses like that,

41
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:45,419
we could put the
parentheses like that.

42
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,460
So that's what the
associative property tells us.

43
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,830
So let me write this down.

44
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,720
So associative
property of addition

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,680
tells us that a plus b plus
c-- we do a plus b first--

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,300
is the same thing as a plus b
plus c, where you do b plus c

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,080
first.

48
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:20,480
The commutative
property tells us

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,090
that a plus b is
equal to b plus a,

50
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,276
that you can move
these guys around.

51
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,400
So let's evaluate this one.

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,560
We actually got here
using both the commutative

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,620
and the associative property.

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,330
So we get negative
7.5 plus 17.5.

55
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,330
This is the exact same
thing as 17.5 minus 7.5.

56
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,750
It might be easier for
you to realize, OK,

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,944
I'm adding two numbers
of different signs,

58
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,360
so what I could do is take the
difference between the two.

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,150
And since the larger
number is positive,

60
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,230
I have a larger number.

61
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,610
Or you could just view
this as 17.5 minus 7.5.

62
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,590
So 17.5 minus 7.5--
the 0.5's cancel out.

63
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,630
17 minus 7 is 10.

64
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,330
So this part right
here becomes 10.

65
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,300
And then we still
have the plus 3 there.

66
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,280
And that, once again, is
going to be equal to 13.

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,450
And we could keep
commuting this around

68
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,750
and keep re-associating it.

69
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,930
No matter how we do it,
we are going to get 13.

70
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,430

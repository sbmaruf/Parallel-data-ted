00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,230
A popular R&B band recently
returned from a successful

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,860
three-city tour where
they played to at

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,500
least 120,000 people.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,140
My brain immediately says that's
greater than or equal

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,180
to 120,000.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,600
If they had an audience of
45,000 in Mesa and another

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,950
33,000 in Denver, how
many people attended

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,090
their show in Las Vegas?

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,170
So let's say Las Vegas, I'll
just use l for Las Vegas.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,330
So the number of people who
attended their show in Las

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,080
Vegas plus the number that
attended their show in Mesa,

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,100
which is 45,000, plus the number
of people that attended

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,020
their show in Denver, which is
33,000-- those are three

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,210
cities right there, Las Vegas,
Mesa, and Denver-- that has to

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,390
be at least 120,000 people.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,410
Or another way of interpreting
that is greater than or equal

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,890
to 120,000.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,040
So to figure out how many people
attended their show in

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,910
Las Vegas, we just solve for
l on this inequalty.

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,960
So if we simplify this left-hand
side, we get the

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,060
number of people in Las Vegas
plus-- what's 45,000 plus

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,630
33,000, that is 78,000-- 78,000
is going to be greater

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,520
than or equal to 120,000.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,830
Now to isolate the l on the
left-hand side of the

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,630
inequality, we can subtract
78,000 from both sides.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,790
So minus 78,000, minus 78,000
on the left-hand side, these

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,920
cancel out.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,870
And we're just left with the
number of people who attended

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,440
the show in Las Vegas is going
to be greater than or equal to

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,990
120,000 minus 78,000.

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,810
So 120,000 minus 80,000 is
40,000, and it's going to be

32
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,880
another 2,000.

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,690
So the number of people who
attended Las Vegas is going to

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,880
be greater than or equal
to 42,000 people.

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,310
And we're done, that's it

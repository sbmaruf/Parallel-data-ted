1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,565
In the last video we went over the multiplication tables for one through nine

2
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:06,960
and I ran out of time, and actually, it was a good thing

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,266
because one through nine are kind of the core multiplication tables.

4
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:14,702
And you'll see that if you know all your multiplication tables from one to nine,

5
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:16,720
so you know any number between one and nine

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,816
times any other number between one and nine,

7
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:21,670
you can actually do any multiplication problem out there.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,642
But what I want to do now

9
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:29,810
is I want to complete the multiplication tables for ten, eleven, and twelve.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,680
So what is ten times-- let's just start with zero.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,980
Ten times zero.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,030
Anything times zero is zero.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,375
Ten zeros are zero.

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,933
Zero plus zero plus zero ten times is still zero.

15
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,107
What's ten times one?

16
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,034
Ten times one.

17
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,982
Well that's just ten one time.

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,740
Or one plus itself ten times.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,890
That's ten.

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,490
I think this is second nature to you at this point.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,447
What's ten times two?

22
00:00:58,447 --> 00:00:59,961
Ten times two.

23
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:02,660
I meant to switch colors, but I didn't.

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,060
Ten times two?

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,950
That's ten plus ten, which is twenty.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,550
Fair enough.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,650
And notice, we went up by ten the first time.

28
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,210
We went up by ten again to get to twenty.

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,690
What's ten times three?

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,546
Well, that's ten plus ten plus ten,

31
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:24,539
or we could view it as ten times two plus another ten,

32
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,485
which is equal to thirty.

33
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:27,385
What's ten times four?

34
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,670
I think you start to see a pattern.

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,450
Ten times four is equal to forty.

36
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,400
Notice, ten times four is equal to forty.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,030
If I were to ask you what is ten times--

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,860
let me do another color-- five?

39
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,260
Well that's equal to fifty.

40
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,410
Ten times anything is that anything with a zero behind it.

41
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,702
So the ten times tables,

42
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,315
you almost don't have to remember it.

43
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:01,378
So let's just keep going.

44
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:04,109
What's ten times six?

45
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,840
It's equal to sixty.

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,340
Six zero.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,090
What's ten times seven?

48
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,315
Seventy.

49
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:13,340
Ten times eight?

50
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,920
This is almost ridiculous.

51
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,810
Ten times eight is eighty.

52
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,020
Ten times nine?

53
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,315
Ninety.

54
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:21,590
Ten times ten?

55
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,708
Now this is interesting.

56
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,882
Ten times ten, so it'll be a ten--

57
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,523
let's see me write this.

58
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:32,180
Let me do it in this orange color.

59
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,302
Ten times ten.

60
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:38,571
So it'll be ten tens or a ten with a zero behind it.

61
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,702
There you go. Notice, whatever number times ten, I just add a zero,

62
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:42,725
then I get the next number.

63
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:43,950
So it's one hundred.

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
And I think you understand why that is.

65
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,900
I added ten to itself ten times.

66
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,700
That each ten-- you go from ten, twenty, thirty.

67
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,240
Thirty is just three tens or ten times three.

68
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Ninety is just nine tens or nine times ten.

69
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,450
Let's keep going.

70
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,120
So ten times eleven is equal to eleven with a zero behind it.

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
One hundred and ten.

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,070
Finally, ten times twelve is equal to one hundred and twenty.

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,370
Now, just for fun, these are kind of your ten times tables.

74
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,460
But now that you know the pattern you can do anything.

75
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:28,266
If I asked you what five thousand seven hundred thirty-two times ten is,

76
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:29,691
what's it going to be?

77
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:32,547
It's going to be this number with just one more zero.

78
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,650
So it's going to be-- I won't read it out yet.

79
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,080
Five seven three two with a zero behind it.

80
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,122
And just so you know,

81
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:42,445
this little comma that I wrote in the number there,

82
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:45,882
that's just to make it easier for me to read that number.

83
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,942
So, you put the comma-- you start over here

84
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,740
and every third number you put the comma.

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,080
So here I'm going to put the comma right here.

86
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm going to put the comma right there.

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
So now I can read this.

88
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,690
The comma doesn't really add or take anything away from the number,

89
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,190
it just helps me read it.

90
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:07,890
Now five thousand seven hundred thirty-two times ten is fifty-seven thousand three hundred twenty.

91
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,195
I just had to add a zero there,

92
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:12,708
but that was a pretty straightforward multiplication.

93
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,239
And notice, we had five thousand times ten

94
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,070
and we got to fifty-something thousand when we multiplied them.

95
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,940
So that's similar to five times ten is equal to fifty.

96
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,848
But instead of five I had a five thousand,

97
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,050
and so I got a fifty thousand and something and all this other stuff.

98
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,940
We're going to learn more about how to do problems like this in the future.

99
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,512
But I thought I would introduce you to the idea

100
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,922
that just from this little pattern of adding a zero,

101
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:37,690
you already know your tens times tables.

102
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,132
Now let's do our elevens.

103
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,137
Our elevens, Elevens get a little bit--

104
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:43,224
Well, they start off easy,

105
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:47,140
and then they get a little more difficult as we get into high numbers.

106
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,000
So, eleven times zero.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
This is easy, this is zero!

108
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,820
Eleven times one.

109
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,000
This is also easy!

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's eleven!

111
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,350
Eleven times two.

112
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,270
We're going to start seeing a pattern here.

113
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,420
It's eleven plus eleven or we could've added two to itself eleven times,

114
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,450
but that is equal to twenty-two.

115
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,510
If we do eleven times three, it is equal to thirty-three.

116
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,550
Eleven times four is equal to forty-four.

117
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,970
I think this is becoming obvious to you.

118
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,980
What's eleven times five?

119
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,930
Eleven times five is fifty-five!

120
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,000
Notice I put the five twice.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,930
What's eleven times six?

122
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,320
It's sixty-six!

123
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,820
Eleven times seven is eighty-four-- no!

124
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,260
I'm kidding!

125
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,710
I didn't want to mess with you like that.

126
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,255
But no.

127
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:36,910
Of course, it's seventy-seven!

128
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,902
Seventy-seven.

129
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,418
You just repeat the number twice.

130
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,086
Seventy-seven.

131
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:42,630
Let me switch colors.

132
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,250
Eleven times eight is equal to eighty-eight.

133
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,420
Eleven times nine is equal to ninety-nine!

134
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,405
Now what's eleven times twelve?

135
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:54,495
Eleven times twelve.

136
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,728
Oh sorry, I skipped ten.

137
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,140
Eleven times ten.

138
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,150
You might want to say it's "tenty-ten!"

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
No!

140
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,410
That's wrong!

141
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,090
It's not "tenty-ten!"

142
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,844
So that little pattern that we had

143
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,433
where you just repeat the number,

144
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,056
that only works for one digit numbers.

145
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:11,602
So it only works for one through nine.

146
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,825
Eleven times ten--

147
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,570
well, we could think about it a couple of ways.

148
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,740
We can add eleven to ninety-nine.

149
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,873
So we can say it's ninety-nine plus eleven.

150
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:21,995
And what's that?

151
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,390
That's equal to one hundred and ten.

152
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,809
And I'm going to show you how to do--

153
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,879
well, hopefully you've already watched the video on how to add two-digit numbers like this,

154
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,210
but that's one hundred and ten.

155
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,153
Or you could just use the property from the tens times tables that we learned.

156
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:36,652
Where if you just take eleven times ten, you add a zero to the eleven,

157
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:37,844
you get one hundred ten.

158
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,590
That's the eleven right there.

159
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,541
Finally, let's do eleven times twelve.

160
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,694
Eleven times twelve.

161
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,007
No easy way to remember this,

162
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,080
you just kind of should remember it.

163
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,180
Or you could say look,

164
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,310
it's going to be eleven more than eleven times-- sorry.

165
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,130
I keep skipping things.

166
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,410
We should do eleven times eleven first.

167
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,700
Let me make sure this is clear.

168
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,590
We're doing eleven times eleven before we go to eleven times twelve.

169
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,480
So eleven times eleven is going to be eleven more than eleven times ten.

170
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,270
So we add eleven to this.

171
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:13,120
Eleven plus one hundred ten is one hundred twenty-one.

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,755
And actually, as you'll see,

173
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:17,831
there actually is an order as we get to higher multiples of eleven,

174
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:20,240
but I'll leave that to a future video.

175
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,715
And then finally, we're at eleven times twelve.

176
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,157
Eleven times twelve.

177
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,552
And we could add eleven to itself twelve times.

178
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,760
We could add twelve to itself eleven times.

179
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,260
Or we could just say,

180
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,910
hey, it's going to be eleven more than eleven times eleven.

181
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,840
So that is what?

182
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,800
You add eleven to this.

183
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,350
What do you get?

184
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,975
You get one hundred thirty-two.

185
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,551
I just added one hundred twenty-one plus eleven

186
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,998
and then got one hundred thirty-two.

187
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,154
Now the other way you could have said it is, well,

188
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,028
what's ten times twelve?

189
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:54,987
Ten times twelve,

190
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:56,160
we already knew that.

191
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,570
That was one hundred twenty.

192
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,888
So eleven times twelve,

193
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:03,038
because we're multiplying twelve by one more

194
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:04,933
should be twelve more than that.

195
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,690
So that should be one hundred thirty-two.

196
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,090
So two ways to get the exact same answer.

197
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,118
All right! Now let's do our twelve times tables.

198
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,173
Twelve times tables.

199
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:16,378
And once you know this

200
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:19,709
you are ready to tackle any type of multiplication problem.

201
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,390
But we'll do that in future videos.

202
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,983
So twelve times zero.

203
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,575
Super easy! Zero.

204
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:26,420
Twelve times one.

205
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,330
Also super easy!

206
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,480
Is twelve.

207
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,920
Now it gets interesting.

208
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,490
We're going to increase by twelve every time.

209
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:37,160
Twelve times two is equal to twenty-four.

210
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,041
Twelve plus twelve is twenty-four, right?

211
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,230
Twelve times-- not twenty-two.

212
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,160
Let me rewrite that.

213
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,250
Twelve times three is going to be twelve plus twelve plus twelve.

214
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,980
Or we could write that as twelve times two.

215
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,070
I see my brain is doing the wrong things.

216
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,670
We could rewrite that as twelve times two plus twelve.

217
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,770
Or we could rewrite that as twenty-four plus twelve.

218
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,020
Either way, all of these get us to thirty-six.

219
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,400
And notice, that's just that plus twelve.

220
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,240
Twelve times four.

221
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,190
Twelve times four is equal to forty-eight.

222
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,270
There's a lot of ways you could think about it.

223
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,155
You could say eleven times four is forty-four.

224
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:24,697
Right? Eleven times four is equal to forty-four.

225
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:30,029
And you go up by one more four, so you get to twelve times four.

226
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,851
Or you could say twelve times three is thirty-six

227
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:36,940
and you can add one twelve to it to get to forty-eight.

228
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,261
Either way works,

229
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,300
and that's because you can multiply in either direction.

230
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Let's keep going.

231
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,840
Twelve times five is equal to sixty.

232
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,694
Ten times five is fifty, eleven times five is fifty-five,

233
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:55,538
so twelve times five is sixty!

234
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:59,014
Twelve times six is equal to what?

235
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,570
It's going to be twelve more than this.

236
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,630
It's going to be equal to seventy-two.

237
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,515
Twelve times seven.

238
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:06,710
Twelve more than this again.

239
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,747
Twelve more than seventy-two is eighty-four.

240
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:13,157
And I'm serious, you know, I'm probably a lot older than you are,

241
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:17,262
and I still, in my head to confirm,

242
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:20,700
I go to some twelve times tables that I remember as definitely right.

243
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,018
Like oh, twelve times five-- and sometimes in my head I say,

244
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:24,090
oh, let me add another twelve.

245
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,290
Oh yeah, definitely, my memory was correct.

246
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,480
Twelve times six is seventy-two.

247
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,020
All right.

248
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,320
Then you go to twelve times eight.

249
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,685
Add twelve to the twelve times seven.

250
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:35,400
Ninety-six.

251
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,370
Twelve times nine.

252
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,504
Well you add twelve to this, so it's one hundred eight.

253
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,510
One hundred eight.

254
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,700
And then twelve times ten.

255
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,332
This is an easy one!

256
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:51,380
Right? We just add a zero to the twelve to get one hundred twenty.

257
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,200
Or we could've added twelve to one hundred eight.

258
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,570
Either way.

259
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,290
Twelve times eleven.

260
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,406
We just did this.

261
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:01,948
You add twelve to this to get one hundred thirty-two.

262
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:05,077
And then twelve times twelve,

263
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:08,931
is equal to one hundred forty-four.

264
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,246
And this actually shows us--

265
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:13,777
If I had a dozen of a dozen eggs-- a dozen is twelve.

266
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:17,010
Or if I had a-- I think a gross is actually twelve dozens.

267
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,400
So that's one hundred forty-four eggs.

268
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,700
So you'll actually end up seeing this number a lot.

269
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,550
More than you would expect in life.

270
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,402
But anyway, we've now completed all of our multiplication tables.

271
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,918
And I really encourage you to take the time now to go and memorize them.

272
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,538
Make some flash cards.

273
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:37,100
Use the little software thing that I wrote on my website.

274
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,850
You could try that out.

275
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,730
As of September Two Thousand Nine, it's working.

276
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,044
I haven't touched it in a while, but I'm actually probably going to rebuild it soon.

277
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,117
So if you're watching this video in the year Two Thousand Two Hundred--

278
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:50,410
Well, I would probably not exist anymore.

279
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,358
But hopefully you'll get a better version of the software app.

280
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,020
But you should practice it.

281
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,610
You should get your parents to quiz you.

282
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,090
You should get notes cards.

283
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,853
You should just be mumbling to yourself as you walk to school--

284
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,180
What is twelve times nine?

285
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,740
What is eleven times eleven?

286
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,305
And you should quiz each other,

287
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:08,690
because it'll pay huge rewards to you later on in life.

288
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,630
See you in the next video!

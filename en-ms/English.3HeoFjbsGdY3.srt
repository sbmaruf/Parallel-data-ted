1
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:11,005
I remember Heaven and Hell had a lot of unwritten rules in those days

2
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:16,000
and match making for the living was still a bit of a wild west.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,018
But I guess that’s where Death comes into the story...

4
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:40,000
and the guy before me had pushed her too far.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,005
It’s not smart to toy with Death, but there was something hypnotic about her...

6
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:54,019
and I wasn’t the only one who thought so.

7
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:58,012
Speak of the Devil, that was me.

8
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:04,000
It was my first day on the job, and I was ready for...

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,011
just about anything...

10
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:16,014
except maybe this guy.

11
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:31,003
They say love is blind. But Cupid was over a thousand years and it didn't stop him from flirting with Death.

12
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:35,011
Now, I could tell he was playing with fate that day.

13
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:42,000
But little did I know what fate had in store for me.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,015
Up there Death was Judge, Jury and Executioner to all lovers, living or otherwise.

15
00:01:47,015 --> 00:02:14,019
But despite his behavior, Death had a soft spot for him and loved watching him work.

16
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:23,022
While Cupid was matching up lovers all over the world, I was tasked with breaking them up.

17
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:35,013
Not exactly what I had in mind.

18
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:40,001
My demon instincts faced constant temptation

19
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:44,021
but I wanted so much more than that.

20
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:52,015
She hid it well, but Death was facing her own demons that day.

21
00:02:52,015 --> 00:03:01,023
I needed to figure out how to impress her.

22
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:05,003
Huh, turned out to be easier than I thought...

23
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:11,007
but it’s not every day I put the moves on an Overlord of the Afterlife!

24
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:15,008
It was my first time and nerves were all over the place.

25
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:38,001
My instincts were on fire, but not in a good way.

26
00:03:38,001 --> 00:04:31,015
That wasn’t my best move.

27
00:04:31,015 --> 00:05:44,011
While Death's guard was down, Cupid saw an opportunity to take fate into his own hands.

28
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:49,003
My story didn’t turn out quite the way I’d imagined.

29
00:05:49,003 --> 99:59:59,000
Hey, somebody had to do Cupid’s work, and the job had its perks.

1
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:52,613
Grandpa! Faster, faster!

2
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,922
Okay, I get it.

3
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,908
Mr. President, I'll do it instead.

4
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:01,567
It's a delight for this grandfather to be able to be a horse for his grandson.

5
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:04,307
Why are you trying to take that from me?

6
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:05,913
JiHoo, are you having fun?

7
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:07,362
Yes, grandpa.

8
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:10,021
Grandpa, can we go fishing?

9
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:13,998
I'll catch a BIG shark.

10
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,688
Fishing? Of course, we can.

11
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:18,592
When do you want to go?

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,718
Let's go now.

13
00:01:19,718 --> 00:02:05,511
Fine, let's go.

14
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,854
Oh, my boy...

15
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:09,351
Mr. President, do you like it that much?

16
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,859
If you become a grandfather,

17
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:17,527
you will know how it feels.

18
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:21,707
Hello.

19
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:25,191
What? Are you sure?

20
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:34,873
Don't hold anything back. Did you check?

21
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:54,002
-Mr. President...- Yes?

22
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:56,587
<i>Due to talks of a possible merger between ShinHwa and JK Group

23
00:02:56,587 --> 00:03:00,525
<i>all stocks regarding ShinHwa Group have been sky rocketing.

24
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:08,562
<i>As people continue to watch closesly as these two groups economize their companies.. they also watch as they plan to join theirs hands in-law

25
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:11,759
Do you know what that means?

26
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,736
If our relationship with JK breaks tomorrow,

27
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,635
What do you think will happen?

28
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:21,005
We don't know whether our company's stock will crash by the morning.

29
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:26,445
This ShinHwa which your grandfather and father built with their blood and sweat.

30
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:28,528
If it collapses due to your foolish love-play,

31
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,245
then will you understand?

32
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,092
Stop it.

33
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:34,924
JoonPyo, give us a moment.

34
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,469
I'm not finished talking.

35
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,064
JoonPyo, starting tomorrow,

36
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:44,455
treat JaeKyung like she's your fiancee, understand?

37
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:47,336
Aren't you going to answer me?

38
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:58,464
Aren't you going to give us a moment?

39
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:01,939
Was I not enough?

40
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,093
Don't butt in.

41
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:05,073
When you needed a hotel, you sold your daughter.

42
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,268
When you need an investment, you sell your son.

43
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:10,664
What will you do if you need anything else?

44
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,753
You don't have any kids left.

45
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,373
I do this all for you and JoonPyo.

46
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:15,575
Who asked you to?

47
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:17,495
Who the hell told you,

48
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,728
that it's all for us?

49
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,609
I've never even saw you,

50
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,613
as someone that was there for us.

51
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:27,722
Who do you think gave you the happiness you're enjoying now?

52
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:32,189
Happiness?

53
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,808
Do you even know,

54
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,558
what happiness really is?

55
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,467
I don't have the luxury to listen, you don't know how lucky you are.

56
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,101
JoonPyo . . .

57
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,628
Leave him alone.

58
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,891
I already said that this doesn't concern you!

59
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,869
This time...

60
00:04:45,869 --> 00:05:39,114
I won't just sit back and watch you do this.

61
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,459
Sunbae!

62
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:46,445
Why are you here?

63
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:53,043
Suam Art CenterConcert Hall

64
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:57,374
Now you. What are you doing here at this hour?

65
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:04,966
I have a bit of a situation.

66
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,234
You're doing all of this yourself?

67
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:33,423
I'm in the process of doing it all.

68
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:35,796
What are you doing?

69
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:54,181
I already told you. I can do some cleaning too.

70
00:06:54,181 --> 00:07:31,754
Thank you.

71
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:36,223
Here you go.

72
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,478
I can't split the work money.

73
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,601
Instead, I'll pay you back with coffee and a drive.

74
00:07:44,601 --> 00:09:29,723
Drive?

75
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:32,005
JanDi... JanDi...

76
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,989
Wake up! Can you hear me?

77
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,812
I'm OK.

78
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:41,415
Get on!

79
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:54,794
Get on!

80
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,361
It's exhaustion plus malnutrition.

81
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,934
If she just rests, she'll be fine.

82
00:09:59,934 --> 00:11:10,179
Thank you.

83
00:11:10,179 --> 00:12:46,257
I'll just do this and go.

84
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:51,237
I held back because you're my friend and she's your girl.

85
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:57,083
And I gave you chances up until the very end.

86
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,125
Now, I'm not going to hold back.

87
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,007
Why? Now that JunPyo's engaged, you're getting nervous?

88
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,931
So you planned to throw yourself at him?

89
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:16,481
- You detestable and audacious little.. - Stop it!

90
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:21,126
This is the company that your grandfather and father built with their blood and sweat.

91
00:13:21,126 --> 00:15:09,031
When you realize that you threw it all away for some love game, then will that set you straight?

92
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:34,278
Nuna, somebody is waiting for you at the playground.

93
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,779
What's wrong?

94
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,682
JunPyo...

95
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:44,251
Gu JunPyo...

96
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:50,731
Did something happen to Gu JoonPyo?

97
00:15:50,731 --> 00:16:01,862
He says he wants to go out for real.

98
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:05,924
I'm so happy. So happy that I thought I was going to go crazy.

99
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,443
I hurried all this way to tell you.

100
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:16,177
You are... going to congratulate me, right?

101
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:18,485
Congratulations.

102
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,888
Falling in love with one's fiance...

103
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:33,081
Don't you think it's so romantic?

104
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:37,603
Thank you.

105
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:43,275
I'm glad I have a friend to tell this to,

106
00:16:43,275 --> 00:17:52,491
I'm so happy.

107
00:17:52,491 --> 00:18:01,999
Hello.

108
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:15,027
Look, I got a matching phone as a present.

109
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:37,134
Let's go.

110
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:40,332
Please look this way.

111
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:47,851
Please look this way.

112
00:18:47,851 --> 00:19:01,001
Is a wedding date set yet?

113
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:06,085
Look at them, they suit each other don't they?

114
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,611
Yes, you can say that.

115
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:13,138
So little time has passed, and already JunPyo looks so dignified.

116
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:21,647
JaeKyung, please be careful not to bring shame to JunPyo.

117
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:26,166
No, I'm sure she won't.I think it's time

118
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,742
that the image of ShinHwa's future first lady changed, don't you?

119
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:34,176
Miss Jaekyung, please stay as bright as you are.

120
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:35,962
Thank you.

121
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:40,516
Then, is it okay if we leave?

122
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,787
Where do you plan to go?

123
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:46,532
It's our first date and you want to stalk us?

124
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,239
Fine.

125
00:19:48,239 --> 00:20:04,888
I got it. Please take care of her, JoonPyo.

126
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:14,982
<i>Over there.

127
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,319
<i>Shoot!

128
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:20,322
How did a little kid like you learn to gamble?!

129
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:39,814
<i>I'm not playing! I'm not playing!

130
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:42,365
<i>I'm staying with grandma.

131
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:49,947
<i>Who's grandma?

132
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,012
Hey, Joon.

133
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:54,773
Joon? Do you think I'm a dog?

134
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,079
Ouch!

135
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:55,092
Hey! You . . .

136
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:59,402
What picture?

137
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:11,471
Ah, let go.

138
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:22,651
Buy this for me!

139
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:27,911
Let's Go Together!

140
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:32,404
No, I don't want to ride this.

141
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:34,772
If you want to ride it, ride it yourself, you woman.

142
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,523
It's a date, why would I ride it by myself?

143
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,875
I see. Are you scared of heights?

144
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:45,165
You really are, aren't you? It really doesn't suit you.

145
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,867
Who's scared of heights?

146
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,322
If you confess you don't need to ride it

147
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:53,502
As soon as you get on the cable car,"AHH, SAVE ME!"

148
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:54,991
You're not going to be like that, are you??

149
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:57,498
Why does this monkey make me into some idiot?

150
00:22:57,498 --> 00:24:47,944
Fine! Let's ride it. I'll just ride it.

151
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,217
Is the studying going well??

152
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:53,404
If I get into medical school with all this studying,

153
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:56,093
then that would be a real miracle.

154
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:59,933
You're really good at miracles.

155
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:01,024
What?

156
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:02,677
Don't you remember?

157
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:10,227
Wondergirl, Geum JanDi.

158
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:36,558
Even if I don't get into medical school, I still want to help out at that grandpa's clinic...

159
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:43,089
Can't you make up with your grandpa?

160
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,578
We've never fought.

161
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,007
Because I'm the one who was thrown away.

162
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:52,038
It's not like that.

163
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,516
Your grandpa's also living with a lot of regret.

164
00:25:56,516 --> 00:26:02,341
- And... - And?

165
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:11,813
He also misses you, Sunbae.

166
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:13,044
What?

167
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,048
I always feel like

168
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:20,058
you understand things better than I do.

169
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:22,324
That person (Min SeoHyun)

170
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:25,564
And grandpa as well.

171
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:35,412
I... just...

172
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,528
Are you really going to be like this?

173
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:40,567
It's always me asking.

174
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,737
And even when we're together, you never agree.

175
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,053
You really are being annoying.

176
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:48,743
If you're really that unsatisfied, you can stop chasing me around.

177
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:52,478
It's because I feel anxious.

178
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:58,853
What?

179
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:07,046
I keep feeling anxious.

180
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:12,759
If you make me believe, if you make me certain,

181
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,731
I'll stop chasing after you.

182
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:18,505
I'll wait patiently.

183
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:22,276
What do you want me to do?

184
00:27:22,276 --> 00:28:39,807
Kiss me.

185
00:28:39,807 --> 00:29:23,676
Hey, Joon. Let's go together.

186
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:27,289
Hey, Joon, I said let's go together.

187
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:29,335
Hey, what is this again?

188
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,973
It's annoying, so go over there.

189
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:36,049
But there are 99 things I've alyways wanted to do once I got a boyfriend.

190
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,233
You're not already annoyed are you?

191
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,984
99 things?

192
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:41,009
I don't want to, so get another guy to do them with.

193
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:44,168
I'm busy.

194
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:47,046
Okay, then let's do just one a day.

195
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:51,774
Then, when we do all the 99 things, we'll reach our 100th day and become real lovers.

196
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:54,047
What 100th day?

197
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,073
You really plan on being together that long?

198
00:29:57,073 --> 00:31:06,085
Then since today's our first day, can't we make it special and do 2 things?

199
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:30,404
Can you...take me somewhere?

200
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:33,693
You probably were an otter during your last life.

201
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,929
Me?

202
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:38,164
You're similar.

203
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:42,298
You both are diligent, off-the-wall, cute,

204
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:47,081
and can't live without water.

205
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:53,427
Couldn't you just say something like the little mermaid or something?

206
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:57,171
The Little Mermaid won't do.

207
00:31:57,171 --> 00:32:00,819
Turning into bubbles because you can't forget your love...

208
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:14,533
is too sad, isn't it?

209
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:20,306
Seems like the otter is hungry?

210
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,657
Ah. Let's go!

211
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:36,555
I'll buy dinner.

212
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:40,447
Monkey, why should I go to a place like this? Go by yourself.

213
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:43,608
Just try to eat at this place, it's really good.

214
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,011
JoonPyo.

215
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:50,138
Oh... it's JanDi!

216
00:32:50,138 --> 00:33:17,488
Jandi, it's like we sense each other, right?

217
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:29,748
Hello, my name is Cha Eun Jae.

218
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:33,767
One moment...

219
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:35,312
Please come in.

220
00:33:35,312 --> 00:34:27,679
Welcome! I welcome you to the world of pottery.

221
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,904
Ah, thank you.

222
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:32,151
The one who is grateful is me.

223
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,027
What?

224
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:36,483
Usually, older women like to come.

225
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:42,562
I'm happy because someone young like you came.

226
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:47,506
How did you get interested in pottery?

227
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:50,051
Someone I know does pottery.

228
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:54,007
Is that someone a person you like?

229
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,456
Huh?

230
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:57,501
Because you want to get to know him

231
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:05,018
You want to learn so you can do it together. I know that feeling well.

232
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:07,229
Teacher, did you also...

233
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,697
We were childhood friends.

234
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:16,033
While other kids were playing house,we learned to make pottery together.

235
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:22,171
Did your boyfriend also become a potter?

236
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:24,452
He's a potter.

237
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:29,843
But he didn't become my boyfriend.

238
00:35:29,843 --> 00:35:33,404
Ah.I don't need sympathy.

239
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:41,463
Thanks to it, I became even stronger.

240
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:49,861
This piece here. Even though it looks weak on the outside, on the inside it's actually very strong.

241
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:52,003
Turned upside down,and stepped on.

242
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:56,236
After it's cut endlessly over and over again on the potter wheel, then . . .

243
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:58,839
1,300 graus

244
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,243
That's right!<Br>After heating it in a kiln at 1,300 degrees

245
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,468
You can make something with as strong a soul as this one.

246
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:08,059
But, GaEul, how did you know that?

247
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:16,732
Ah, it's because I've heard it before.

248
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:19,302
To me, that friend was,

249
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:23,715
was my kiln and my potter's wheel.

250
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:32,571
Have you forgotten that person now?

251
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:34,948
Gaeul, please bring your friend here sometime.

252
00:36:34,948 --> 00:37:25,234
I'm curious.

253
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,594
This is my studio.

254
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:29,021
Do your "job"

255
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:32,731
Somewhere else.

256
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:38,806
Son, don't you do the same thing?

257
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:43,099
Why don't the two of us try to get along, okay?

258
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,797
If you're going to be this way,

259
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,901
I'll move to another studio.

260
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:52,386
You can not do that.

261
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:55,589
I'm the one that should leave.

262
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:58,559
But you can't.

263
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,182
Did you forget that the person to take on the "So" name

264
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,977
is not me, but YiJung.

265
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:09,302
You.

266
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,047
I've never said I wanted to do that.

267
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:14,187
You've never said you didn't want it either.

268
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:17,244
Am I not correct?

269
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:28,999
Why must you live like this?

270
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:33,036
Because I'm bored.

271
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:37,588
Living is so boring, son.

272
00:38:37,588 --> 00:38:40,492
Have you ever lived properly,

273
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:44,254
for even one second?

274
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:50,228
The woman who makes me want to live right....

275
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:56,365
came only once in my entire life.

276
00:38:56,365 --> 00:39:02,331
If you lose a woman like that....

277
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:07,294
every other woman is the same.

278
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:11,683
It's just all meaningless repetition.

279
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,366
Don't you think that to mom....

280
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:21,087
Don't you think that you're being too cruel to mom?

281
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:29,054
That's why I wish this lifetime would go by faster.

282
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:40,444
It's just not working out the way I want it to.

283
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:45,059
Do you know why you passed Il-Hyun and became the head of our family?

284
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:52,695
It's because you resemble me the most.

285
00:39:52,695 --> 00:40:01,277
Cruel, don't you think?

286
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:05,786
Don't forget it. Once in a lifetime.

287
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:11,256
The real thing comes only once.

288
00:40:11,256 --> 00:40:54,239
That's just another cruel truth.

289
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:01,811
Here's "kim-bap" for 2 people

290
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:14,554
Event! 50 Bowls of Free Coupons for ladieswho can eat our jumbo ramyun in 20 mins!

291
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:15,973
Enjoy!

292
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,088
Excuse me.Yes?

293
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:20,593
Is that real?

294
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:21,961
Yes.

295
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:24,531
But it's pretty hard to accomplish.

296
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:26,166
Do you want to try it?

297
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:29,004
If you succeed, do you really get 50 coupons for free ramen noodles?

298
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:31,137
of course!

299
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:34,407
But...who is going to do it?

300
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:36,297
Me!

301
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,878
Hey, monkey, what are you doing?

302
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:46,652
JanDi, you want to try too, right?

303
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:49,589
All right. I'll win it for you!

304
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:52,925
No, don't. Do you really think you'll be able to eat all that?

305
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,399
What will you do if I win?

306
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:55,595
What?

307
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:56,698
If I win...

308
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:58,666
you three have to grant my wish.

309
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:02,669
- Wish? - Okay. We'll grant it.

310
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:12,445
All right! Ready to meet the challenge!

311
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:51,615
GO!

312
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:56,706
5... 4... 3... 2....

313
00:42:56,706 --> 00:42:59,914
1!

314
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:24,451
Success!

315
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:30,641
Jandi! For you.

316
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,917
Now, you all have to grant my wish.

317
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:36,484
What kind of wish?

318
00:43:36,484 --> 00:43:38,082
Let's go on a trip!

319
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,837
What?

320
00:43:39,837 --> 00:43:40,888
The four of us,

321
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:43,077
JanDi, JiHoo, JoonPyo and I.

322
00:43:43,077 --> 00:43:46,342
Two couples on a double date trip to our resort.

323
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:50,835
Hey, monkey, I really hate double anything.

324
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:55,269
What do you mean? You said you'd grant my wish.

325
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:04,879
JanDi, you will go, right? Let's go! Hmm, hmm?

326
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:07,248
What the heck are you, anyway?

327
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,664
How can a girl eat that all?

328
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:17,488
What a glutton!

329
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,406
JanDi, let's go. Hmm, hmm?

330
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:44,856
JiHoo, let's go, hmm?

331
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:47,068
Mom, please don't die!

332
00:44:47,068 --> 00:44:53,041
Don't die.

333
00:44:53,041 --> 00:45:03,146
Found you.

334
00:45:03,146 --> 00:45:08,222
- Do you think mom will die?- She'll be fine.

335
00:45:08,222 --> 00:46:54,371
- YiJung! So YiJung? Where are you? - IlHyun Oppa is calling you.

336
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:56,787
how did you find me?

337
00:46:56,787 --> 00:47:01,346
Wherever you are, I just know where you are.

338
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:40,797
You can't leave until I fall asleep.

339
00:47:40,797 --> 00:48:11,857
Can I . . . sleep?

340
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:26,657
EunJae, will you be able to find me again?

341
00:48:26,657 --> 00:49:33,648
You were always the one who found me.

342
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:35,876
Good morning!

343
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:39,447
Hey Monkey, why are you here so early in the morning?

344
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:45,352
What kind of question is that to ask your fiancee?

345
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:50,332
It's ok. I take it as a term of endearment, so I'm not bothered by it.

346
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:53,006
I'm used to it.

347
00:49:53,006 --> 00:49:56,697
You're making a perfectly fine person into an idiot.

348
00:49:56,697 --> 00:50:00,013
This is why girls who are raised properly are different.

349
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:05,431
That sweet heart of yours can't be bought with money or taught.

350
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:12,588
Not really. I have a friend who has a very hard life but she keeps working hard without any complaints.

351
00:50:12,588 --> 00:50:14,626
Friend?

352
00:50:14,626 --> 00:50:16,063
Hey, Monkey!

353
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:19,798
Aren't you leaving? If we leave late, we'll get stuck in traffic.

354
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:22,005
I'm leaving!

355
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:28,596
Have a great time.

356
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:38,711
Over here.

357
00:50:38,711 --> 00:50:44,957
Hello. How are you?

358
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:51,903
Wait right here.

359
00:50:51,903 --> 00:50:55,099
Tadah!

360
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:03,396
What do you think? Is it pretty? Do you think JoonPyo will like it?

361
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:07,054
Normally I find these things really cheesy.

362
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:08,903
But I guess people really do change.

363
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:16,144
I keep wanting to brand him: "This man is mine."

364
00:51:16,144 --> 00:51:21,883
- J and J? - JoonPyo and JaeKyung.

365
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:32,096
When I was getting this engraved, I felt really awkward. Is this man really my other half?

366
00:51:32,096 --> 00:52:43,566
J and J...right...

367
00:52:43,566 --> 00:52:46,934
Are you guys finished?

368
00:52:46,934 --> 00:53:04,251
Let's see.

369
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,753
It's awful.

370
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:08,889
Please prepare our dinner.

371
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:30,571
Yes, Barbeque.

372
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:40,545
Jandi, eat a lot.

373
00:53:40,545 --> 00:56:01,637
Let's make a toast! I already drank it all.

374
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:05,921
Hey Jandi! Guem Jandi, are you OK?

375
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:10,031
Wake up!

376
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:11,564
Hey, Geum JanDi, are you ok?

377
00:56:11,564 --> 00:56:20,576
Can you hear me?

378
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:23,259
Goo JoonPyo,

379
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:28,216
I thought you couldn't swim.

380
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:34,369
I can, now.

381
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:37,033
What happened?

382
00:56:37,033 --> 00:56:43,059
I learned.

383
00:56:43,059 --> 00:57:01,562
Don't lift your head up. Turn it to the side.

384
00:57:01,562 --> 00:57:16,269
I realized I would rather drown than to watch another guy save you. So I was able to learn.

385
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:20,083
What happened? JanDi, are you ok?

386
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,869
She is ok.

387
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:24,733
Thank god !

388
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,894
I'll take care of her from here.

389
00:57:27,894 --> 00:58:06,414
Yes. Take her so she can rest.

390
00:58:06,414 --> 00:58:09,484
You, are you okay?

391
00:58:09,484 --> 00:59:05,461
I'm okay.

392
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:13,298
Here's your lattes.

393
00:59:13,298 --> 00:59:15,231
- Which cake is good?<Br>- Oh, cake?

394
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:18,013
Today we have chocolate cake, and cheesecake.

395
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,903
With lattes, cheese cake will probably go better.

396
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:21,789
Then give us two cheesecakes.

397
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:39,054
Two? Okay.

398
00:59:39,054 --> 00:59:43,051
Why are you acting like this? Are you crazy?

399
00:59:43,051 --> 00:59:44,847
No.

400
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:49,045
I'm perfectly okay. That's how I know.

401
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:54,336
What? What do you mean you know?

402
00:59:54,336 --> 00:59:56,857
Do you remember?

403
00:59:56,857 --> 01:00:01,662
The story that grandfather used to tell,the story of the god of the kiln.

404
01:00:01,662 --> 01:00:04,599
What are you talking about?

405
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:11,045
The dish that the kiln god chose was not mine, but yours, YiJung.

406
01:00:11,045 --> 01:00:20,027
Hyung. (Older brother)

407
01:00:20,027 --> 01:00:27,588
This hand . . . How much I wanted this hand.

408
01:00:27,588 --> 01:00:47,574
You don't know, right?

409
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:50,891
Because of that....

410
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:55,583
you're quitting?

411
01:00:55,583 --> 01:01:04,501
So you're leaving me alone like this?

412
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:07,495
You're running away!

413
01:01:07,495 --> 01:01:32,687
You're leaving me alone in this house. Leaving me all the responsibilities and you're running away!

414
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:36,757
Are you alright?

415
01:01:36,757 --> 01:01:41,066
I keep forgetting that I'm not supposed to swim.

416
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:50,937
I'm supposed to be your fireman. And now your lifeguard too?

417
01:01:50,937 --> 01:01:56,911
I forgot something at the spa.I'll fetch it and be right back.

418
01:01:56,911 --> 01:02:39,838
Don't worry. I won't get into trouble again.

419
01:02:39,838 --> 01:03:23,159
I'll take her from here.

420
01:03:23,159 --> 99:59:59,999
What?

00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:10,059
CHAPTER I.

2
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:17,021
One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking upfrom anxious dreams, he discovered that in

3
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:23,097
bed he had been changed into a monstrousverminous bug.

4
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:30,055
He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, ashe lifted his head up a little, his brown,

5
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:37,085
arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sections.

6
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:43,068
From this height the blanket, just aboutready to slide off completely, could hardly

7
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:46,059
stay in place.

8
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:51,041
His numerous legs, pitifully thin incomparison to the rest of his

9
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:55,048
circumference, flickered helplessly beforehis eyes.

10
00:00:55,048 --> 00:01:00,067
"What's happened to me," he thought.

11
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:06,025
It was no dream.His room, a proper room for a human being,

12
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:12,084
only somewhat too small, lay quietlybetween the four well-known walls.

13
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:17,099
Above the table, on which an unpackedcollection of sample cloth goods was spread

14
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:23,035
out--Samsa was a travelling salesman--hungthe picture which he had cut out of an

15
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:29,097
illustrated magazine a little while ago andset in a pretty gilt frame.

16
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:34,549
It was a picture of a woman with a fur hatand a fur boa.

17
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:40,509
She sat erect there, lifting up in thedirection of the viewer a solid fur muff

18
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,061
into which her entire forearm haddisappeared.

19
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:49,119
Gregor's glance then turned to the window.

20
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,259
The dreary weather--the rain drops werefalling audibly down on the metal window

21
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,789
ledge--made him quite melancholy.

22
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:03,007
"Why don't I keep sleeping for a littlewhile longer and forget all this

23
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,002
foolishness," he thought.

24
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:12,319
But this was entirely impractical, for hewas used to sleeping on his right side, and

25
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,002
in his present state he couldn't gethimself into this position.

26
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:22,084
No matter how hard he threw himself ontohis right side, he always rolled again onto

27
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:24,047
his back.

28
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:29,022
He must have tried it a hundred times,closing his eyes so that he would not have

29
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:35,043
to see the wriggling legs, and gave up onlywhen he began to feel a light, dull pain in

30
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:38,006
his side which he had never felt before.

31
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:45,059
"O God," he thought, "what a demanding jobI've chosen!

32
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:48,097
Day in, day out, on the road.

33
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:54,159
The stresses of selling are much greaterthan the work going on at head office, and,

34
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,069
in addition to that, I have to cope withthe problems of travelling, the worries

35
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,008
about train connections, irregular bad

36
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:08,047
food, temporary and constantly changinghuman relationships, which never come from

37
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:13,033
the heart.To hell with it all!"

38
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:17,036
He felt a slight itching on the top of hisabdomen.

39
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:22,519
He slowly pushed himself on his back closerto the bed post so that he could lift his

40
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,078
head more easily, found the itchy part,which was entirely covered with small white

41
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:35,519
spots--he did not know what to make of themand wanted to feel the place with a leg.

42
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,099
But he retracted it immediately, for thecontact felt like a cold shower all over

43
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,439
him.

44
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,051
He slid back again into his earlierposition.

45
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:53,068
"This getting up early," he thought, "makesa man quite idiotic.

46
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:55,087
A man must have his sleep.

47
00:03:55,087 --> 00:04:00,909
Other travelling salesmen live like haremwomen.

48
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,002
For instance, when I come back to the innduring the course of the morning to write

49
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:10,068
up the necessary orders, these gentlemenare just sitting down to breakfast.

50
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:16,016
If I were to try that with my boss, I'd bethrown out on the spot.

51
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:20,041
Still, who knows whether that mightn't bereally good for me?

52
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:25,022
If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake,I'd have quit ages ago.

53
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:30,063
I would've gone to the boss and told himjust what I think from the bottom of my

54
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,014
heart.

55
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:36,082
He would've fallen right off his desk!How weird it is to sit up at that desk and

56
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:41,017
talk down to the employee from way upthere.

57
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:47,074
The boss has trouble hearing, so theemployee has to step up quite close to him.

58
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:50,069
Anyway, I haven't completely given up thathope yet.

59
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:56,072
Once I've got together the money to pay offmy parents' debt to him--that should take

60
00:04:56,072 --> 00:05:01,079
another five or six years--I'll do it forsure.

61
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,075
Then I'll make the big break.

62
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:11,066
In any case, right now I have to get up.My train leaves at five o'clock."

63
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:16,049
He looked over at the alarm clock tickingaway by the chest of drawers.

64
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,067
"Good God!" he thought.

65
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,049
It was half past six, and the hands weregoing quietly on.

66
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:28,041
It was past the half hour, already nearlyquarter to.

67
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,009
Could the alarm have failed to ring?

68
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,046
One saw from the bed that it was properlyset for four o'clock.

69
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:40,006
Certainly it had rung.Yes, but was it possible to sleep through

70
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,011
that noise which made the furniture shake?

71
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:51,005
Now, it's true he'd not slept quietly, butevidently he'd slept all the more deeply.

72
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:56,088
Still, what should he do now?The next train left at seven o'clock.

73
00:05:56,088 --> 00:06:00,084
To catch that one, he would have to go in amad rush.

74
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:05,069
The sample collection wasn't packed up yet,and he really didn't feel particularly

75
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,082
fresh and active.

76
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:13,003
And even if he caught the train, there wasno avoiding a blow-up with the boss,

77
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:17,013
because the firm's errand boy would'vewaited for the five o'clock train and

78
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:20,093
reported the news of his absence long ago.

79
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:25,087
He was the boss's minion, without backboneor intelligence.

80
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:29,006
Well then, what if he reported in sick?

81
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:35,004
But that would be extremely embarrassingand suspicious, because during his five

82
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:40,037
years' service Gregor hadn't been sick evenonce.

83
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:44,082
The boss would certainly come with thedoctor from the health insurance company

84
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:50,082
and would reproach his parents for theirlazy son and cut short all objections with

85
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:54,067
the insurance doctor's comments; for him

86
00:06:54,067 --> 00:07:00,012
everyone was completely healthy but reallylazy about work.

87
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:05,002
And besides, would the doctor in this casebe totally wrong?

88
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:11,006
Apart from a really excessive drowsinessafter the long sleep, Gregor in fact felt

89
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:16,057
quite well and even had a really strongappetite.

90
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:22,036
As he was thinking all this over in thegreatest haste, without being able to make

91
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:27,083
the decision to get out of bed--the alarmclock was indicating exactly quarter to

92
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:33,009
seven--there was a cautious knock on thedoor by the head of the bed.

93
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:39,099
"Gregor," a voice called--it was hismother!--"it's quarter to seven.

94
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,093
Don't you want to be on your way?"

95
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:48,022
The soft voice!Gregor was startled when he heard his voice

96
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,015
answering.

97
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:56,003
It was clearly and unmistakably his earliervoice, but in it was intermingled, as if

98
00:07:56,003 --> 00:08:02,008
from below, an irrepressibly painfulsqueaking, which left the words positively

99
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:06,016
distinct only in the first moment and

100
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:12,061
distorted them in the reverberation, sothat one didn't know if one had heard

101
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,054
correctly.

102
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:18,051
Gregor wanted to answer in detail andexplain everything, but in these

103
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:24,041
circumstances he confined himself tosaying, "Yes, yes, thank you mother.

104
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:28,029
I'm getting up right away."

105
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:33,219
Because of the wooden door the change inGregor's voice was not really noticeable

106
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:40,038
outside, so his mother calmed down withthis explanation and shuffled off.

107
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,061
However, as a result of the shortconversation, the other family members

108
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:50,051
became aware that Gregor was unexpectedlystill at home, and already his father was

109
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:55,016
knocking on one side door, weakly but withhis fist.

110
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:59,033
"Gregor, Gregor," he called out, "what'sgoing on?"

111
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:04,028
And, after a short while, he urged him onagain in a deeper voice: "Gregor!"

112
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:08,017
Gregor!"At the other side door, however, his sister

113
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,052
knocked lightly.

114
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,087
"Gregor?Are you all right?

115
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:18,052
Do you need anything?"Gregor directed answers in both directions,

116
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,095
"I'll be ready right away."

117
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:27,007
He made an effort with the most carefularticulation and by inserting long pauses

118
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:34,064
between the individual words to removeeverything remarkable from his voice.

119
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:37,042
His father turned back to his breakfast.

120
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:44,047
However, the sister whispered, "Gregor,open the door--I beg you."

121
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:49,014
Gregor had no intention of opening thedoor, but congratulated himself on his

122
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:56,025
precaution, acquired from travelling, oflocking all doors during the night, even at

123
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,028
home.

124
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:04,099
First he wanted to stand up quietly andundisturbed, get dressed, above all have

125
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:12,005
breakfast, and only then consider furtheraction, for--he noticed this clearly--by

126
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:18,033
thinking things over in bed he would notreach a reasonable conclusion.

127
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:24,063
He remembered that he had already oftenfelt a light pain or other in bed, perhaps

128
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:29,045
the result of an awkward lying position,which later turned out to be purely

129
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,018
imaginary when he stood up, and he was

130
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:36,005
eager to see how his present fantasieswould gradually dissipate.

131
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:43,019
That the change in his voice was nothingother than the onset of a real chill, an

132
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,093
occupational illness of commercialtravellers, of that he had not the

133
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:51,074
slightest doubt.

134
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:54,077
It was very easy to throw aside theblanket.

135
00:10:54,077 --> 00:11:00,013
He needed only to push himself up a little,and it fell by itself.

136
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:06,031
But to continue was difficult, particularlybecause he was so unusually wide.

137
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:11,012
He needed arms and hands to push himselfupright.

138
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:18,019
Instead of these, however, he had only manysmall limbs which were incessantly moving

139
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:25,092
with very different motions and which, inaddition, he was unable to control.

140
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:32,073
If he wanted to bend one of them, then itwas the first to extend itself, and if he

141
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:38,091
finally succeeded doing what he wanted withthis limb, in the meantime all the others,

142
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:44,092
as if left free, moved around in anexcessively painful agitation.

143
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:51,034
"But I must not stay in bed uselessly,"said Gregor to himself.

144
00:11:51,034 --> 00:12:00,069
At first he wanted to get out of bed withthe lower part of his body, but this lower

145
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:05,031
part--which, by the way, he had not yetlooked at and which he also couldn't

146
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:09,071
picture clearly--proved itself toodifficult to move.

147
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:14,529
The attempt went so slowly.

148
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:20,024
When, having become almost frantic, hefinally hurled himself forward with all his

149
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:27,001
force and without thinking, he chose hisdirection incorrectly, and he hit the lower

150
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,279
bedpost hard.

151
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,023
The violent pain he felt revealed to himthat the lower part of his body was at the

152
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:37,004
moment probably the most sensitive.

153
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:44,075
Thus, he tried to get his upper body out ofthe bed first and turned his head carefully

154
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:47,054
toward the edge of the bed.

155
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:53,091
He managed to do this easily, and in spiteof its width and weight his body mass at

156
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:58,003
last slowly followed the turning of hishead.

157
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:04,011
But as he finally raised his head outsidethe bed in the open air, he became anxious

158
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:08,098
about moving forward any further in thismanner, for if he allowed himself

159
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:11,074
eventually to fall by this process, it

160
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:15,075
would take a miracle to prevent his headfrom getting injured.

161
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:20,079
And at all costs he must not loseconsciousness right now.

162
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,092
He preferred to remain in bed.

163
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:31,007
However, after a similar effort, while helay there again, sighing as before, and

164
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:38,001
once again saw his small limbs fighting oneanother, if anything worse than earlier,

165
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:41,036
and didn't see any chance of imposing quiet

166
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:46,062
and order on this arbitrary movement, hetold himself again that he couldn't

167
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:52,039
possibly remain in bed and that it might bethe most reasonable thing to sacrifice

168
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,089
everything if there was even the slightest

169
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:58,024
hope of getting himself out of bed in theprocess.

170
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:05,057
At the same moment, however, he didn'tforget to remind himself from time to time

171
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:12,279
of the fact that calm--indeed the calmest--reflection might be better than the most

172
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,079
confused decisions.

173
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:22,043
At such moments, he directed his gaze asprecisely as he could toward the window,

174
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:27,083
but unfortunately there was littleconfident cheer to be had from a glance at

175
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:32,094
the morning mist, which concealed even theother side of the narrow street.

176
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:40,279
"It's already seven o'clock," he toldhimself at the latest striking of the alarm

177
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,018
clock, "already seven o'clock and stillsuch a fog."

178
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:52,004
And for a little while longer he layquietly with weak breathing, as if perhaps

179
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:58,279
waiting for normal and natural conditionsto re-emerge out of the complete stillness.

180
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:05,096
But then he said to himself, "Before itstrikes a quarter past seven, whatever

181
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:09,023
happens I must be completely out of bed.

182
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:14,067
Besides, by then someone from the officewill arrive to inquire about me, because

183
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:18,061
the office will open before seven o'clock."

184
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:24,041
And he made an effort then to rock hisentire body length out of the bed with a

185
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,044
uniform motion.

186
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:31,095
If he let himself fall out of the bed inthis way, his head, which in the course of

187
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:38,005
the fall he intended to lift up sharply,would probably remain uninjured.

188
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:44,077
His back seemed to be hard; nothing wouldreally happen to that as a result of the

189
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,074
fall.

190
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:51,057
His greatest reservation was a worry aboutthe loud noise which the fall must create

191
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:57,839
and which presumably would arouse, if notfright, then at least concern on the other

192
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
side of all the doors.

193
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,026
However, it had to be tried.

194
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:09,073
As Gregor was in the process of liftinghimself half out of bed--the new method was

195
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:16,036
more of a game than an effort; he neededonly to rock with a constant rhythm--it

196
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:21,589
struck him how easy all this would be ifsomeone were to come to his aid.

197
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:27,077
Two strong people--he thought of his fatherand the servant girl--would have been quite

198
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:29,013
sufficient.

199
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:34,022
They would have only had to push their armsunder his arched back to get him out of the

200
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:40,087
bed, to bend down with their load, and thenmerely to exercise patience and care that

201
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:44,279
he completed the flip onto the floor, where

202
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,085
his diminutive legs would then, he hoped,acquire a purpose.

203
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:55,023
Now, quite apart from the fact that thedoors were locked, should he really call

204
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,021
out for help?

205
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:04,689
In spite of all his distress, he was unableto suppress a smile at this idea.

206
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:10,003
He had already got to the point where, byrocking more strongly, he maintained his

207
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:16,064
equilibrium with difficulty, and very soonhe would finally have to decide, for in

208
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:19,008
five minutes it would be a quarter pastseven.

209
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:23,042
Then there was a ring at the door of theapartment.

210
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:28,006
"That's someone from the office," he toldhimself, and he almost froze while his

211
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:32,054
small limbs only danced around all thefaster.

212
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:35,058
For one moment everything remained still.

213
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:41,008
"They aren't opening," Gregor said tohimself, caught up in some absurd hope.

214
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:49,679
But of course then, as usual, the servantgirl with her firm tread went to the door

215
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,098
and opened it.

216
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:56,679
Gregor needed to hear only the first wordof the visitor's greeting to recognize

217
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,016
immediately who it was, the managerhimself.

218
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:07,008
Why was Gregor the only one condemned towork in a firm where, at the slightest

219
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:13,005
lapse, someone immediately attracted thegreatest suspicion?

220
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:18,036
Were all the employees then collectively,one and all, scoundrels?

221
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:24,075
Among them was there then no truly devotedperson who, if he failed to use just a

222
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:29,076
couple of hours in the morning for officework, would become abnormal from pangs of

223
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:34,077
conscience and really be in no state to getout of bed?

224
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:39,015
Was it really not enough to let anapprentice make inquiries, if such

225
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:41,077
questioning was even necessary?

226
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:47,052
Must the manager himself come, and in theprocess must it be demonstrated to the

227
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:52,000
entire innocent family that theinvestigation of this suspicious

228
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,096
circumstance could be entrusted only to theintelligence of the manager?

229
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:03,061
And more as a consequence of the excitedstate in which this idea put Gregor than as

230
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:11,024
a result of an actual decision, he swunghimself with all his might out of the bed.

231
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:15,028
There was a loud thud, but not a realcrash.

232
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:21,006
The fall was absorbed somewhat by thecarpet and, in addition, his back was more

233
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:25,013
elastic than Gregor had thought.

234
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:30,049
For that reason the dull noise was notquite so conspicuous.

235
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:35,011
But he had not held his head up withsufficient care and had hit it.

236
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:42,092
He turned his head, irritated and in pain,and rubbed it on the carpet.

237
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:48,011
"Something has fallen in there," said themanager in the next room on the left.

238
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:52,929
Gregor tried to imagine to himself whetheranything similar to what was happening to

239
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,015
him today could have also happened at somepoint to the manager.

240
00:19:57,015 --> 00:20:02,062
At least one had to concede the possibilityof such a thing.

241
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:08,075
However, as if to give a rough answer tothis question, the manager now, with a

242
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:15,049
squeak of his polished boots, took a fewdetermined steps in the next room.

243
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,071
From the neighbouring room on the right thesister was whispering to inform Gregor:

244
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:26,041
"Gregor, the manager is here.""I know," said Gregor to himself.

245
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:32,058
But he did not dare make his voice loudenough so that his sister could hear.

246
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:37,086
"Gregor," his father now said from theneighbouring room on the left, "Mr. Manager

247
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:42,035
has come and is asking why you have notleft on the early train.

248
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:45,004
We don't know what we should tell him.

249
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:49,048
Besides, he also wants to speak to youpersonally.

250
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:53,076
So please open the door.He will be good enough to forgive the mess

251
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:56,008
in your room."

252
00:20:56,008 --> 00:21:00,065
In the middle of all this, the managercalled out in a friendly way, "Good

253
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:01,075
morning, Mr. Samsa."

254
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:08,001
"He is not well," said his mother to themanager, while his father was still talking

255
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:12,033
at the door, "He is not well, believe me,Mr. Manager.

256
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,092
Otherwise how would Gregor miss a train?

257
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:19,041
The young man has nothing in his headexcept business.

258
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:23,011
I'm almost angry that he never goes out atnight.

259
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:28,079
Right now he's been in the city eight days,but he's been at home every evening.

260
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:35,013
He sits here with us at the table and readsthe newspaper quietly or studies his travel

261
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:36,559
schedules.

262
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,058
It's a quite a diversion for him to busyhimself with fretwork.

263
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:46,062
For instance, he cut out a small frame overthe course of two or three evenings.

264
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:49,036
You'd be amazed how pretty it is.

265
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:53,054
It's hanging right inside the room.You'll see it immediately, as soon as

266
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:57,029
Gregor opens the door.Anyway, I'm happy that you're here, Mr.

267
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,299
Manager.

268
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,053
By ourselves, we would never have madeGregor open the door.

269
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:07,078
He's so stubborn, and he's certainly notwell, although he denied that this

270
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:09,071
morning."

271
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:17,085
"I'm coming right away," said Gregor slowlyand deliberately and didn't move, so as not

272
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,089
to lose one word of the conversation.

273
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:26,072
"My dear lady, I cannot explain it tomyself in any other way," said the manager;

274
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,094
"I hope it is nothing serious.

275
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:34,066
On the other hand, I must also say that webusiness people, luckily or unluckily,

276
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:41,001
however one looks at it, very often simplyhave to overcome a slight indisposition for

277
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:43,029
business reasons."

278
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,058
"So can Mr. Manager come in to see younow?" asked his father impatiently and

279
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:53,063
knocked once again on the door."No," said Gregor.

280
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:58,078
In the neighbouring room on the left apainful stillness descended.

281
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:05,026
In the neighbouring room on the right thesister began to sob.

282
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:08,559
Why didn't his sister go to the others?

283
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,022
She'd probably just gotten up out of bednow and hadn't even started to get dressed

284
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:16,006
yet.Then why was she crying?

285
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:21,063
Because he wasn't getting up and wasn'tletting the manager in, because he was in

286
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:27,044
danger of losing his position, and becausethen his boss would badger his parents once

287
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:29,045
again with the old demands?

288
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:34,038
Those were probably unnecessary worriesright now.

289
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:39,054
Gregor was still here and wasn't thinkingat all about abandoning his family.

290
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:46,013
At the moment he was lying right there onthe carpet, and no one who knew about his

291
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:50,095
condition would've seriously demanded thathe let the manager in.

292
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:56,048
But Gregor wouldn't be casually dismissedright way because of this small

293
00:23:56,048 --> 00:24:03,002
discourtesy, for which he would find aneasy and suitable excuse later on.

294
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:08,012
It seemed to Gregor that it might be farmore reasonable to leave him in peace at

295
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:13,019
the moment, instead of disturbing him withcrying and conversation.

296
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:19,036
But it was the very uncertainty whichdistressed the others and excused their

297
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:24,086
behaviour."Mr. Samsa," the manager was now shouting,

298
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:27,069
his voice raised, "what's the matter?

299
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:34,049
You are barricading yourself in your room,answer with only a yes and a no, are making

300
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:40,074
serious and unnecessary troubles for yourparents, and neglecting (I mention this

301
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:46,039
only incidentally) your commercial dutiesin a truly unheard of manner.

302
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,073
I am speaking here in the name of yourparents and your employer, and I am

303
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:58,006
requesting you in all seriousness for animmediate and clear explanation.

304
00:24:58,006 --> 00:24:59,064
I am amazed.

305
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:04,099
I am amazed.I thought I knew you as a calm, reasonable

306
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:10,048
person, and now you appear suddenly to wantto start parading around in weird moods.

307
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:18,022
The Chief indicated to me earlier this veryday a possible explanation for your

308
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:22,051
neglect--it concerned the collection ofcash entrusted to you a short while ago--

309
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:26,027
but in truth I almost gave him my word of

310
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:30,023
honour that this explanation could not becorrect.

311
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:36,069
However, now I see here your unimaginablepig headedness, and I am totally losing any

312
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:39,036
desire to speak up for you in theslightest.

313
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:44,016
And your position is not at all the mostsecure.

314
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:48,041
Originally I intended to mention all thisto you privately, but since you are letting

315
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:53,012
me waste my time here uselessly, I don'tknow why the matter shouldn't come to the

316
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,034
attention of your parents.

317
00:25:54,034 --> 00:26:00,086
Your productivity has also been veryunsatisfactory recently.

318
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:05,076
Of course, it's not the time of year toconduct exceptional business, we recognize

319
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:12,032
that, but a time of year for conducting nobusiness, there is no such thing at all,

320
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:15,048
Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be."

321
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:22,299
"But Mr. Manager," called Gregor, besidehimself and, in his agitation, forgetting

322
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:27,059
everything else, "I'm opening the doorimmediately, this very moment.

323
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:32,006
A slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, hasprevented me from getting up.

324
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:37,065
I'm still lying in bed right now.But I'm quite refreshed once again.

325
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:40,023
I'm in the midst of getting out of bed.

326
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:46,034
Just have patience for a short moment!Things are not going as well as I thought.

327
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:51,669
But things are all right.How suddenly this can overcome someone!

328
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:54,033
Only yesterday evening everything was finewith me.

329
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:58,669
My parents certainly know that.Actually just yesterday evening I had a

330
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,023
small premonition.

331
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:06,038
People must have seen that in me.Why have I not reported that to the office?

332
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:10,096
But people always think that they'll getover sickness without having to stay at

333
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,015
home.

334
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:15,097
Mr. Manager!Take it easy on my parents!

335
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:20,057
There is really no basis for the criticismswhich you're now making against me, and

336
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:23,429
really nobody has said a word to me aboutthat.

337
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:28,009
Perhaps you have not read the latest orderswhich I shipped.

338
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:34,005
Besides, now I'm setting out on my trip onthe eight o'clock train; the few hours'

339
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:36,809
rest have made me stronger.

340
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:41,065
Mr. Manager, do not stay.I will be at the office in person right

341
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:45,094
away.Please have the goodness to say that and to

342
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:49,082
convey my respects to the Chief."

343
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:55,004
While Gregor was quickly blurting all thisout, hardly aware of what he was saying, he

344
00:27:55,004 --> 00:28:00,679
had moved close to the chest of drawerswithout effort, probably as a result of the

345
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,049
practice he had already had in bed, and now

346
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:09,086
he was trying to raise himself up on it.Actually, he wanted to open the door.

347
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:15,073
He really wanted to let himself be seen byand to speak with the manager.

348
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:21,001
He was keen to witness what the others nowasking about him would say when they saw

349
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:25,038
him.If they were startled, then Gregor had no

350
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,033
more responsibility and could be calm.

351
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:34,919
But if they accepted everything quietly,then he would have no reason to get excited

352
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,039
and, if he got a move on, could really beat the station around eight o'clock.

353
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,007
At first he slid down a few times on thesmooth chest of drawers.

354
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:52,023
But at last he gave himself a final swingand stood upright there.

355
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:57,048
He was no longer at all aware of the painsin his lower body, no matter how they might

356
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:59,078
still sting.

357
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:04,076
Now he let himself fall against the back ofa nearby chair, on the edge of which he

358
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:08,024
braced himself with his thin limbs.

359
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:13,919
By doing this he gained control overhimself and kept quiet, for he could now

360
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,799
hear the manager.

361
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,089
"Did you understood a single word?" themanager asked the parents, "Is he playing

362
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:23,419
the fool with us?"

363
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:29,679
"For God's sake," cried the mother alreadyin tears, "perhaps he's very ill and we're

364
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,059
upsetting him.Grete!

365
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,929
Grete!" she yelled at that point.

366
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,096
"Mother?" called the sister from the otherside.

367
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:41,009
They were making themselves understoodthrough Gregor's room.

368
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:44,025
"You must go to the doctor right away.

369
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,048
Gregor is sick.Hurry to the doctor.

370
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:50,169
Have you heard Gregor speak yet?"

371
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:56,016
"That was an animal's voice," said themanager, remarkably quietly in comparison

372
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:59,008
to the mother's cries."Anna!

373
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:03,078
Anna!' yelled the father through the hallinto the kitchen, clapping his hands,

374
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:06,051
"fetch a locksmith right away!"

375
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:11,061
The two young women were already runningthrough the hall with swishing skirts--how

376
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:15,091
had his sister dressed herself so quickly?--and yanked open the doors of the

377
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:17,179
apartment.

378
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:21,082
One couldn't hear the doors closing at all.They probably had left them open, as is

379
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:28,019
customary in an apartment where a hugemisfortune has taken place.

380
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,002
However, Gregor had become much calmer.

381
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:37,002
All right, people did not understand hiswords any more, although they seemed clear

382
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:43,021
enough to him, clearer than previously,perhaps because his ears had gotten used to

383
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,001
them.

384
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:48,085
But at least people now thought that thingswere not all right with him and were

385
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:51,009
prepared to help him.

386
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:56,036
The confidence and assurance with which thefirst arrangements had been carried out

387
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,028
made him feel good.

388
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:04,073
He felt himself included once again in thecircle of humanity and was expecting from

389
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:10,004
both the doctor and the locksmith, withoutdifferentiating between them with any real

390
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:15,179
precision, splendid and surprising results.

391
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:20,036
In order to get as clear a voice aspossible for the critical conversation

392
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:25,549
which was imminent, he coughed a little,and certainly took the trouble to do this

393
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,061
in a really subdued way, since it was

394
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:34,087
possible that even this noise sounded likesomething different from a human cough.

395
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:39,046
He no longer trusted himself to decide anymore.

396
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:42,087
Meanwhile in the next room it had becomereally quiet.

397
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:48,023
Perhaps his parents were sitting with themanager at the table whispering; perhaps

398
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:52,058
they were all leaning against the doorlistening.

399
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:58,027
Gregor pushed himself slowly towards thedoor, with the help of the easy chair, let

400
00:31:58,027 --> 00:32:05,008
go of it there, threw himself against thedoor, held himself upright against it--the

401
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:09,025
balls of his tiny limbs had a little sticky

402
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:14,052
stuff on them--and rested there momentarilyfrom his exertion.

403
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:19,074
Then he made an effort to turn the key inthe lock with his mouth.

404
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:24,035
Unfortunately it seemed that he had no realteeth.

405
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:27,073
How then was he to grab hold of the key?

406
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:33,073
But to make up for that his jaws werenaturally very strong; with their help he

407
00:32:33,073 --> 00:32:36,082
managed to get the key really moving.

408
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:41,086
He didn't notice that he was obviouslyinflicting some damage on himself, for a

409
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:50,023
brown fluid came out of his mouth, flowedover the key, and dripped onto the floor.

410
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:53,089
"Just listen for a moment," said themanager in the next room; "he's turning the

411
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:59,179
key."For Gregor that was a great encouragement.

412
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:03,061
But they all should've called out to him,including his father and mother, "Come on,

413
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:09,075
Gregor," they should've shouted; "keepgoing, keep working on the lock."

414
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:14,087
Imagining that all his efforts were beingfollowed with suspense, he bit down

415
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:19,032
frantically on the key with all the forcehe could muster.

416
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:23,789
As the key turned more, he danced aroundthe lock.

417
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:29,099
Now he was holding himself upright onlywith his mouth, and he had to hang onto the

418
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:35,659
key or then press it down again with thewhole weight of his body, as necessary.

419
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:42,098
The quite distinct click of the lock as itfinally snapped really woke Gregor up.

420
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:49,789
Breathing heavily he said to himself, "So Ididn't need the locksmith," and he set his

421
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:55,048
head against the door handle to open thedoor completely.

422
00:33:55,048 --> 00:34:01,026
Because he had to open the door in thisway, it was already open very wide without

423
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:03,919
him yet being really visible.

424
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,072
He first had to turn himself slowly aroundthe edge of the door, very carefully, of

425
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:14,046
course, if he didn't want to fall awkwardlyon his back right at the entrance into the

426
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,839
room.

427
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,029
He was still preoccupied with thisdifficult movement and had no time to pay

428
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:26,619
attention to anything else, when he heardthe manager exclaim a loud "Oh!"--it

429
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,096
sounded like the wind whistling--and now he

430
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:35,007
saw him, nearest to the door, pressing hishand against his open mouth and moving

431
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:42,289
slowly back, as if an invisible constantforce was pushing him away.

432
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:47,071
His mother--in spite of the presence of themanager she was standing here with her hair

433
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:53,046
sticking up on end, still a mess from thenight--was looking at his father with her

434
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:55,389
hands clasped.

435
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:01,229
She then went two steps towards Gregor andcollapsed right in the middle of her

436
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:06,569
skirts, which were spread out all aroundher, her face sunk on her breast,

437
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:08,096
completely concealed.

438
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:15,239
His father clenched his fist with a hostileexpression, as if he wished to push Gregor

439
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,769
back into his room, then looked uncertainlyaround the living room, covered his eyes

440
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:27,609
with his hands, and cried so that hismighty breast shook.

441
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:33,619
At this point Gregor did not take one stepinto the room, but leaned his body from the

442
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:40,289
inside against the firmly bolted wing ofthe door, so that only half his body was

443
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:43,014
visible, as well as his head, tilted

444
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:48,013
sideways, with which he peeped over at theothers.

445
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,489
Meanwhile it had become much brighter.

446
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:56,019
Standing out clearly from the other side ofthe street was a part of the endless grey-

447
00:35:56,019 --> 00:36:02,799
black house situated opposite--it was ahospital--with its severe regular windows

448
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:05,089
breaking up the facade.

449
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:12,042
The rain was still coming down, but only inlarge individual drops visibly and firmly

450
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:17,038
thrown down one by one onto the ground.

451
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:22,859
The breakfast dishes were standing piledaround on the table, because for his father

452
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:28,064
breakfast was the most important meal timein the day, which he prolonged for hours by

453
00:36:28,064 --> 00:36:30,042
reading various newspapers.

454
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:37,018
Directly across on the opposite wall hung aphotograph of Gregor from the time of his

455
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:43,569
military service; it was a picture of himas a lieutenant, as he, smiling and worry

456
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:49,094
free, with his hand on his sword, demandedrespect for his bearing and uniform.

457
00:36:49,094 --> 00:36:57,029
The door to the hall was ajar, and sincethe door to the apartment was also open,

458
00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:02,043
one could see out into the landing of theapartment and the start of the staircase

459
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:05,059
going down.

460
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:10,002
"Now," said Gregor, well aware that he wasthe only one who had kept his composure.

461
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:17,309
"I'll get dressed right away, pack up thecollection of samples, and set off.

462
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:20,479
You'll allow me to set out on my way, willyou not?

463
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:25,599
You see, Mr. Manager, I am not pig-headed,and I am happy to work.

464
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,046
Travelling is exhausting, but I couldn'tlive without it.

465
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:33,089
Where are you going, Mr. Manager?To the office?

466
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:33,819
Really?

467
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,719
Will you report everything truthfully?

468
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:42,369
A person can be incapable of workmomentarily, but that's precisely the best

469
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:47,092
time to remember the earlier achievementsand to consider that later, after the

470
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:49,799
obstacles have been shoved aside, the

471
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:54,619
person will work all the more eagerly andintensely.

472
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,096
I am really so indebted to Mr. Chief--youknow that perfectly well.

473
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:04,067
On the other hand, I am concerned about myparents and my sister.

474
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:08,099
I'm in a fix, but I'll work myself out ofit again.

475
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,229
Don't make things more difficult for methan they already are.

476
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:18,239
Speak up on my behalf in the office!People don't like travelling salesmen.

477
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,119
I know that.

478
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,839
People think they earn pots of money andthus lead a fine life.

479
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,269
People don't even have any special reasonto think through this judgment more

480
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,239
clearly.

481
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:35,069
But you, Mr. Manager, you have a betterperspective on what's involved than other

482
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:39,569
people, even, I tell you in totalconfidence, a better perspective than Mr.

483
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:42,499
Chairman himself, who in his capacity as

484
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:48,038
the employer may let his judgment makecasual mistakes at the expense of an

485
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:48,859
employee.

486
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:54,065
You also know well enough that thetravelling salesman who is outside the

487
00:38:54,065 --> 00:39:02,004
office almost the entire year can become soeasily a victim of gossip, coincidences,

488
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:05,018
and groundless complaints, against which

489
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:10,259
it's impossible for him to defend himself,since for the most part he doesn't hear

490
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:16,045
about them at all and only then when he'sexhausted after finishing a trip and at

491
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:20,719
home gets to feel in his own body the nasty

492
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,046
consequences, which can't be thoroughlyexplored back to their origins.

493
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:30,729
Mr. Manager, don't leave without speaking aword telling me that you'll at least

494
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,619
concede that I'm a little in the right!"

495
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:40,969
But at Gregor's first words the manager hadalready turned away, and now he looked back

496
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:45,095
at Gregor over his twitching shoulders withpursed lips.

497
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:52,229
During Gregor's speech he was not still fora moment but kept moving away towards the

498
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:58,359
door, without taking his eyes off Gregor,but really gradually, as if there was a

499
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:01,329
secret ban on leaving the room.

500
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:06,259
He was already in the hall, and given thesudden movement with which he finally

501
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:10,619
pulled his foot out of the living room, onecould have believed that he had just burned

502
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,093
the sole of his foot.

503
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:18,229
In the hall, however, he stretched hisright hand out away from his body towards

504
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:25,049
the staircase, as if some trulysupernatural relief was waiting for him

505
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,066
there.

506
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:33,339
Gregor realized that he must not under anycircumstances allow the manager to go away

507
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:38,729
in this frame of mind, especially if hisposition in the firm was not to be placed

508
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,369
in the greatest danger.

509
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:44,269
His parents did not understand all thisvery well.

510
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:50,009
Over the long years, they had developed theconviction that Gregor was set up for life

511
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:55,779
in his firm and, in addition, they had somuch to do nowadays with their present

512
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:59,829
troubles that all foresight was foreign tothem.

513
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:05,599
But Gregor had this foresight.The manager must be held back, calmed down,

514
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,969
convinced, and finally won over.

515
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:13,209
The future of Gregor and his family reallydepended on it!

516
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:16,979
If only the sister had been there!She was clever.

517
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:21,063
She had already cried while Gregor wasstill lying quietly on his back.

518
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:27,369
And the manager, this friend of the ladies,would certainly let himself be guided by

519
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:28,719
her.

520
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,041
She would have closed the door to theapartment and talked him out of his fright

521
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:37,065
in the hall.But the sister was not even there.

522
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:42,059
Gregor must deal with it himself.

523
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,819
Without thinking that as yet he didn't knowanything about his present ability to move

524
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:53,589
and that his speech possibly--indeedprobably--had once again not been

525
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:56,459
understood, he left the wing of the door,

526
00:41:56,459 --> 00:42:01,249
pushed himself through the opening, andwanted to go over to the manager, who was

527
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:06,016
already holding tight onto the handrailwith both hands on the landing in a

528
00:42:06,016 --> 00:42:07,869
ridiculous way.

529
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:13,709
But as he looked for something to holdonto, with a small scream Gregor

530
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:17,019
immediately fell down onto his numerouslittle legs.

531
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:22,769
Scarcely had this happened, when he feltfor the first time that morning a general

532
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:24,989
physical well being.

533
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:32,042
The small limbs had firm floor under them;they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed to his

534
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:37,259
joy, and strove to carry him forward in thedirection he wanted.

535
00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:42,609
Right away he believed that the finalamelioration of all his suffering was

536
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,088
immediately at hand.

537
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:50,859
But at the very moment when he lay on thefloor rocking in a restrained manner quite

538
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:56,009
close and directly across from his mother,who had apparently totally sunk into

539
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:59,349
herself, she suddenly sprang right up with

540
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:06,329
her arms spread far apart and her fingersextended and cried out, "Help, for God's

541
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,369
sake, help!"

542
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:14,289
She held her head bowed down, as if shewanted to view Gregor better, but ran

543
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:19,259
senselessly back, contradicting thatgesture, forgetting that behind her stood

544
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:21,042
the table with all the dishes on it.

545
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:27,369
When she reached the table, she sat downheavily on it, as if absent-mindedly, and

546
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:32,009
did not appear to notice at all that nextto her coffee was pouring out onto the

547
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:38,088
carpet in a full stream from the largeoverturned container.

548
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:45,119
"Mother, mother," said Gregor quietly, andlooked over towards her.

549
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,799
The manager momentarily had disappearedcompletely from his mind.

550
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:55,095
At the sight of the flowing coffee Gregorcouldn't stop himself snapping his jaws in

551
00:43:55,095 --> 00:43:58,769
the air a few times .

552
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:04,009
At that his mother screamed all over again,hurried from the table, and collapsed into

553
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:09,059
the arms of his father, who was rushingtowards her.

554
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:14,849
But Gregor had no time right now for hisparents--the manager was already on the

555
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:18,045
staircase.His chin level with the banister, the

556
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:21,799
manager looked back for the last time.

557
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:25,579
Gregor took an initial movement to catch upto him if possible.

558
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:30,269
But the manager must have suspectedsomething, because he made a leap down over

559
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:34,859
a few stairs and disappeared, stillshouting "Huh!"

560
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:39,979
The sound echoed throughout the entirestairwell.

561
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:45,064
Now, unfortunately this flight of themanager also seemed to bewilder his father

562
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:46,209
completely.

563
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:51,959
Earlier he had been relatively calm, forinstead of running after the manager

564
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:57,599
himself or at least not hindering Gregorfrom his pursuit, with his right hand he

565
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,549
grabbed hold of the manager's cane, which

566
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:04,619
he had left behind with his hat andovercoat on a chair.

567
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,002
With his left hand, his father picked up alarge newspaper from the table and,

568
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:15,015
stamping his feet on the floor, he set outto drive Gregor back into his room by

569
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:18,349
waving the cane and the newspaper.

570
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:24,599
No request of Gregor's was of any use; norequest would even be understood.

571
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,839
No matter how willing he was to turn hishead respectfully, his father just stomped

572
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,039
all the harder with his feet.

573
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,329
Across the room from him his mother hadpulled open a window, in spite of the cool

574
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:44,489
weather, and leaning out with her hands onher cheeks, she pushed her face far outside

575
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:46,044
the window.

576
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:51,609
Between the alley and the stairwell astrong draught came up, the curtains on the

577
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:57,359
window flew around, the newspapers on thetable swished, and individual sheets

578
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,979
fluttered down over the floor.

579
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:06,094
The father relentlessly pressed forward,pushing out sibilants, like a wild man.

580
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:13,489
Now, Gregor had no practice at all in goingbackwards--it was really very slow going.

581
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:17,859
If Gregor only had been allowed to turnhimself around, he would have been in his

582
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:23,339
room right away, but he was afraid to makehis father impatient by the time-consuming

583
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,459
process of turning around, and each moment

584
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:32,299
he faced the threat of a mortal blow on hisback or his head from the cane in his

585
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:33,569
father's hand.

586
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:39,339
Finally Gregor had no other option, for henoticed with horror that he did not

587
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:44,499
understand yet how to maintain hisdirection going backwards.

588
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:50,088
And so he began, amid constantly anxioussideways glances in his father's direction,

589
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:56,569
to turn himself around as quickly aspossible, although in truth this was only

590
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:57,329
done very slowly.

591
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:03,093
Perhaps his father noticed his goodintentions, for he did not disrupt Gregor

592
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:09,349
in this motion, but with the tip of thecane from a distance he even directed

593
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:13,015
Gregor's rotating movement here and there.

594
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:18,095
If only his father had not hissed sounbearably!

595
00:47:18,095 --> 00:47:22,619
Because of that Gregor totally lost hishead.

596
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,093
He was already almost totally turnedaround, when, always with this hissing in

597
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:33,109
his ear, he just made a mistake and turnedhimself back a little.

598
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:37,739
But when he finally was successful ingetting his head in front of the door

599
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:43,219
opening, it became clear that his body wastoo wide to go through any further.

600
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:50,329
Naturally his father, in his present mentalstate, had no idea of opening the other

601
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:55,719
wing of the door a bit to create a suitablepassage for Gregor to get through.

602
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:01,559
His single fixed thought was that Gregormust get into his room as quickly as

603
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:02,369
possible.

604
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:07,959
He would never have allowed the elaboratepreparations that Gregor required to orient

605
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:11,279
himself and thus perhaps get through thedoor.

606
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:16,449
On the contrary, as if there were noobstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now

607
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:19,239
drove Gregor forwards.

608
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,069
Behind Gregor the sound at this point wasno longer like the voice of only a single

609
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:25,329
father.

610
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:31,109
Now it was really no longer a joke, andGregor forced himself, come what might,

611
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,789
into the door.One side of his body was lifted up.

612
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,599
He lay at an angle in the door opening.

613
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:46,329
His one flank was sore with the scraping.On the white door ugly blotches were left.

614
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:52,029
Soon he was stuck fast and would have notbeen able to move any more on his own.

615
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:58,014
The tiny legs on one side hung twitching inthe air above, and the ones on the other

616
00:48:58,014 --> 00:49:01,019
side were pushed painfully into the floor.

617
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:08,044
Then his father gave him one really strongliberating push from behind, and he

618
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:13,869
scurried, bleeding severely, far into theinterior of his room.

619
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:18,769
The door was slammed shut with the cane,and finally it was quiet.

620
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:35,699
CHAPTER II.

621
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:42,339
Gregor first woke up from his heavy swoon-like sleep in the evening twilight.

622
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:47,589
He would certainly have woken up soonafterwards without any disturbance, for he

623
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:53,799
felt himself sufficiently rested and wideawake, although it appeared to him as if a

624
00:49:53,799 --> 00:50:01,119
hurried step and a cautious closing of thedoor to the hall had aroused him.

625
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,279
Light from the electric streetlamps laypale here and there on the ceiling and on

626
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:13,017
the higher parts of the furniture, butunderneath around Gregor it was dark.

627
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:19,069
He pushed himself slowly toward the door,still groping awkwardly with his feelers,

628
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:25,809
which he now learned to value for the firsttime, to check what was happening there.

629
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:33,699
His left side seemed one single longunpleasantly stretched scar, and he really

630
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:37,067
had to hobble on his two rows of legs.

631
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:42,068
In addition, one small leg had beenseriously wounded in the course of the

632
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:48,043
morning incident--it was almost a miraclethat only one had been hurt--and dragged

633
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:52,239
lifelessly behind.

634
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:58,239
By the door he first noticed what hadreally lured him there: it was the smell of

635
00:50:58,239 --> 00:50:59,229
something to eat.

636
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:07,219
A bowl stood there, filled with sweetenedmilk, in which swam tiny pieces of white

637
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:08,004
bread.

638
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:14,499
He almost laughed with joy, for he now hada much greater hunger than in the morning,

639
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:21,069
and he immediately dipped his head almostup to and over his eyes down into the milk.

640
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:26,369
But he soon drew it back again indisappointment, not just because it was

641
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:32,339
difficult for him to eat on account of hisdelicate left side--he could eat only if

642
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,239
his entire panting body worked in a

643
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:41,041
coordinated way--but also because the milk,which otherwise was his favourite drink and

644
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:46,088
which his sister had certainly placed therefor that reason, did not appeal to him at

645
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:48,019
all.

646
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:53,829
He turned away from the bowl almost withaversion and crept back into the middle of

647
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:56,539
the room.

648
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:03,239
In the living room, as Gregor saw throughthe crack in the door, the gas was lit, but

649
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:09,039
where, on other occasions at this time ofday, his father was accustomed to read the

650
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,799
afternoon newspaper in a loud voice to his

651
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:18,869
mother and sometimes also to his sister, atthe moment no sound was audible.

652
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:23,749
Now, perhaps this reading aloud, aboutwhich his sister had always spoken and

653
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:28,869
written to him, had recently fallen out oftheir general routine.

654
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:35,009
But it was so still all around, in spite ofthe fact that the apartment was certainly

655
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:35,699
not empty.

656
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:43,092
"What a quiet life the family leads," saidGregor to himself and, as he stared fixedly

657
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:50,039
out in front of him into the darkness, hefelt a great pride that he had been able to

658
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:53,009
provide such a life in a beautiful

659
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:56,009
apartment like this for his parents and hissister.

660
00:52:56,009 --> 00:53:04,339
But how would things go if now alltranquillity, all prosperity, all

661
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:09,049
contentment should come to a horrible end?

662
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:14,599
In order not to lose himself in suchthoughts, Gregor preferred to set himself

663
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:21,359
moving, so he moved up and down in hisroom.

664
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:27,092
Once during the long evening one side doorand then the other door was opened just a

665
00:53:27,092 --> 00:53:34,799
tiny crack and quickly closed again.Someone presumably needed to come in but

666
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:37,064
had then thought better of it.

667
00:53:37,064 --> 00:53:42,619
Gregor immediately took up a position bythe living room door, determined to bring

668
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:49,469
in the hesitant visitor somehow or other orat least to find out who it might be.

669
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:53,989
But now the door was not opened any more,and Gregor waited in vain.

670
00:53:53,989 --> 00:54:00,739
Earlier, when the door had been barred,they had all wanted to come in to him; now,

671
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:05,489
when he had opened one door and when theothers had obviously been opened during the

672
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:13,989
day, no one came any more, and the keyswere stuck in the locks on the outside.

673
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:20,449
The light in the living room was turned offonly late at night, and now it was easy to

674
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:25,619
establish that his parents and his sisterhad stayed awake all this time, for one

675
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:30,729
could hear clearly as all three moved awayon tiptoe.

676
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:35,038
Now it was certain that no one would comeinto Gregor any more until the morning.

677
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:42,849
Thus, he had a long time to thinkundisturbed about how he should reorganize

678
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:44,004
his life from scratch.

679
00:54:44,004 --> 00:54:51,093
But the high, open room, in which he wascompelled to lie flat on the floor, made

680
00:54:51,093 --> 00:54:57,199
him anxious, without his being able tofigure out the reason, for he had lived in

681
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,229
the room for five years.

682
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:06,329
With a half unconscious turn and notwithout a slight shame he scurried under

683
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:12,013
the couch, where, in spite of the fact thathis back was a little cramped and he could

684
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:14,959
no longer lift up his head, he felt very

685
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:21,559
comfortable and was sorry only that hisbody was too wide to fit completely under

686
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:22,749
it.

687
00:55:22,749 --> 00:55:30,029
There he remained the entire night, whichhe spent partly in a state of semi-sleep,

688
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:35,739
out of which his hunger constantly woke himwith a start, but partly in a state of

689
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:39,509
worry and murky hopes, which all led to the

690
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:46,066
conclusion that for the time being he wouldhave to keep calm and with patience and the

691
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:51,091
greatest consideration for his familytolerate the troubles which in his present

692
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:57,819
condition he was now forced to cause them.

693
00:55:57,819 --> 00:56:04,069
Already early in the morning--it was stillalmost night--Gregor had an opportunity to

694
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:11,269
test the power of the decisions he had justmade, for his sister, almost fully dressed,

695
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:17,859
opened the door from the hall into his roomand looked eagerly inside.

696
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:23,004
She did not find him immediately, but whenshe noticed him under the couch--God, he

697
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:29,038
had to be somewhere or other, for he couldhardly fly away--she got such a shock that,

698
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:32,089
without being able to control herself, she

699
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:35,009
slammed the door shut once again from theoutside.

700
00:56:35,009 --> 00:56:41,099
However, as if she was sorry for herbehaviour, she immediately opened the door

701
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:46,091
again and walked in on her tiptoes, as ifshe was in the presence of a serious

702
00:56:46,091 --> 00:56:51,329
invalid or a total stranger.

703
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:56,269
Gregor had pushed his head forward just tothe edge of the couch and was observing

704
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:57,339
her.

705
00:56:57,339 --> 00:57:02,529
Would she really notice that he had leftthe milk standing, not indeed from any lack

706
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:08,869
of hunger, and would she bring in somethingelse to eat more suitable for him?

707
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:13,749
If she did not do it on her own, he wouldsooner starve to death than call her

708
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:19,018
attention to the fact, although he had areally powerful urge to move beyond the

709
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:22,239
couch, throw himself at his sister's feet,

710
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,017
and beg her for something or other good toeat.

711
00:57:25,017 --> 00:57:32,013
But his sister noticed right away withastonishment that the bowl was still full,

712
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:35,068
with only a little milk spilled around it.

713
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:41,018
She picked it up immediately, although notwith her bare hands but with a rag, and

714
00:57:41,018 --> 00:57:43,849
took it out of the room.

715
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:49,089
Gregor was extremely curious what she wouldbring as a substitute, and he pictured to

716
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:52,769
himself different ideas about it.

717
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:58,319
But he never could have guessed what hissister out of the goodness of her heart in

718
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,469
fact did.

719
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:06,719
She brought him, to test his taste, anentire selection, all spread out on an old

720
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,699
newspaper.

721
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:14,089
There were old half-rotten vegetables,bones from the evening meal, covered with a

722
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:21,789
white sauce which had almost solidified,some raisins and almonds, cheese which

723
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,039
Gregor had declared inedible two days

724
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:31,067
earlier, a slice of dry bread, and a sliceof salted bread smeared with butter.

725
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:37,249
In addition to all this, she put down abowl--probably designated once and for all

726
00:58:37,249 --> 00:58:41,439
as Gregor's--into which she had poured somewater.

727
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:46,209
And out of her delicacy of feeling, sinceshe knew that Gregor would not eat in front

728
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:52,209
of her, she went away very quickly and eventurned the key in the lock, so that Gregor

729
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:56,239
would now observe that he could makehimself as comfortable as he wished.

730
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:03,769
Gregor's small limbs buzzed now that thetime for eating had come.

731
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:07,092
His wounds must, in any case, have alreadyhealed completely.

732
00:59:07,092 --> 00:59:11,015
He felt no handicap on that score.

733
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:16,289
He was astonished at that and thought abouthow more than a month ago he had cut his

734
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:22,015
finger slightly with a knife and how thiswound had hurt enough even the day before

735
00:59:22,015 --> 00:59:22,015
yesterday.

736
00:59:22,015 --> 00:59:30,259
"Am I now going to be less sensitive," hethought, already sucking greedily on the

737
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:37,569
cheese, which had strongly attracted himright away, more than all the other foods.

738
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:43,689
Quickly and with his eyes watering withsatisfaction, he ate one after the other

739
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:51,449
the cheese, the vegetables, and the sauce.The fresh food, by contrast, didn't taste

740
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:53,019
good to him.

741
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:58,279
He couldn't bear the smell and even carriedthe things he wanted to eat a little

742
00:59:58,279 --> 01:00:00,249
distance away.

743
01:00:00,249 --> 01:00:06,209
By the time his sister slowly turned thekey as a sign that he should withdraw, he

744
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:11,599
was long finished and now lay lazily in thesame spot.

745
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,014
The noise immediately startled him, inspite of the fact that he was already

746
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:21,239
almost asleep, and he scurried back againunder the couch.

747
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:26,819
But it cost him great self-control toremain under the couch, even for the short

748
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:32,569
time his sister was in the room, becausehis body had filled out somewhat on account

749
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:39,013
of the rich meal and in the narrow spacethere he could scarcely breathe.

750
01:00:39,013 --> 01:00:44,009
In the midst of minor attacks ofasphyxiation, he looked at her with

751
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:50,088
somewhat protruding eyes, as hisunsuspecting sister swept up with a broom,

752
01:00:50,088 --> 01:00:53,119
not just the remnants, but even the foods

753
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,339
which Gregor had not touched at all, as ifthese were also now useless, and as she

754
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:04,469
dumped everything quickly into a bucket,which she closed with a wooden lid, and

755
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:08,079
then carried all of it out of the room.

756
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,064
She had hardly turned around before Gregorhad already dragged himself out from the

757
01:01:13,064 --> 01:01:19,064
couch, stretched out, and let his bodyexpand.

758
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:25,739
In this way Gregor got his food every day,once in the morning, when his parents and

759
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:32,329
the servant girl were still asleep, and asecond time after the common noon meal, for

760
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:35,269
his parents were, as before, asleep then

761
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:40,091
for a little while, and the servant girlwas sent off by his sister on some errand

762
01:01:40,091 --> 01:01:42,229
or other.

763
01:01:42,229 --> 01:01:48,299
They certainly would not have wanted Gregorto starve to death, but perhaps they could

764
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:54,339
not have endured finding out what he ateother than by hearsay.

765
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:59,469
Perhaps his sister wanted to spare themwhat was possibly only a small grief, for

766
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:04,092
they were really suffering quite enoughalready.

767
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:10,929
What sorts of excuses people had used onthat first morning to get the doctor and

768
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:18,029
the locksmith out of the house Gregor wascompletely unable to ascertain.

769
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:23,038
Since they could not understand him, noone, not even his sister, thought that he

770
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:29,489
might be able to understand others, andthus, when his sister was in her room, he

771
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:31,689
had to be content with listening now and

772
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:36,499
then to her sighs and invocations to thesaints.

773
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:42,539
Only later, when she had grown somewhataccustomed to everything--naturally there

774
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:47,859
could never be any talk of her growingcompletely accustomed to it--Gregor

775
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:49,429
sometimes caught a comment which was

776
01:02:49,429 --> 01:02:54,759
intended to be friendly or could beinterpreted as such.

777
01:02:54,759 --> 01:03:00,189
"Well, today it tasted good to him," shesaid, if Gregor had really cleaned up what

778
01:03:00,189 --> 01:03:06,013
he had to eat; whereas, in the reversesituation, which gradually repeated itself

779
01:03:06,013 --> 01:03:14,064
more and more frequently, she used to saysadly, "Now everything has stopped again."

780
01:03:14,064 --> 01:03:20,609
But while Gregor could get no newinformation directly, he did hear a good

781
01:03:20,609 --> 01:03:26,599
deal from the room next door, and as soonas he heard voices, he scurried right away

782
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:32,819
to the appropriate door and pressed hisentire body against it.

783
01:03:32,819 --> 01:03:37,939
In the early days especially, there was noconversation which was not concerned with

784
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:42,849
him in some way or other, even if only insecret.

785
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:49,719
For two days at all meal times discussionson that subject could be heard on how

786
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:55,299
people should now behave; but they alsotalked about the same subject in the times

787
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:58,229
between meals, for there were always at

788
01:03:58,229 --> 01:04:03,809
least two family members at home, since noone really wanted to remain in the house

789
01:04:03,809 --> 01:04:08,088
alone and people could not under anycircumstances leave the apartment

790
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:11,929
completely empty.

791
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:17,709
In addition, on the very first day theservant girl--it was not completely clear

792
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:23,014
what and how much she knew about what hadhappened--on her knees had begged his

793
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:26,749
mother to let her go immediately, and when

794
01:04:26,749 --> 01:04:32,499
she said good bye about fifteen minuteslater, she thanked them for the dismissal

795
01:04:32,499 --> 01:04:37,979
with tears in her eyes, as if she wasreceiving the greatest favour which people

796
01:04:37,979 --> 01:04:40,989
had shown her there, and, without anyone

797
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:47,091
demanding it from her, she swore a fearfuloath not to betray anyone, not even the

798
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:50,589
slightest bit.

799
01:04:50,589 --> 01:04:55,679
Now his sister had to team up with hismother to do the cooking, although that

800
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:00,063
didn't create much trouble because peoplewere eating almost nothing.

801
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:06,469
Again and again Gregor listened as one ofthem vainly invited another one to eat and

802
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:13,064
received no answer other than "Thank you.I've had enough" or something like that.

803
01:05:13,064 --> 01:05:17,859
And perhaps they had stopped havinganything to drink, too.

804
01:05:17,859 --> 01:05:22,939
His sister often asked his father whetherhe wanted to have a beer and gladly offered

805
01:05:22,939 --> 01:05:29,229
to fetch it herself, and when his fatherwas silent, she said, in order to remove

806
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:35,038
any reservations he might have, that shecould send the caretaker's wife to get it.

807
01:05:35,038 --> 01:05:41,038
But then his father finally said aresounding "No," and nothing more would be

808
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:44,349
spoken about it.

809
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:49,869
Already during the first day his fatherlaid out all the financial circumstances

810
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:55,013
and prospects to his mother and to hissister as well.

811
01:05:55,013 --> 01:06:00,049
From time to time he stood up from thetable and pulled out of the small lockbox

812
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:05,042
salvaged from his business, which hadcollapsed five years previously, some

813
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:09,299
document or other or some notebook.

814
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:15,459
The sound was audible as he opened up thecomplicated lock and, after removing what

815
01:06:15,459 --> 01:06:19,709
he was looking for, locked it up again.

816
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:26,049
These explanations by his father were, inpart, the first enjoyable thing that Gregor

817
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:30,219
had the chance to listen to since hisimprisonment.

818
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:35,789
He had thought that nothing at all was leftover for his father from that business; at

819
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:41,489
least his father had told him nothing tocontradict that view, and Gregor in any

820
01:06:41,489 --> 01:06:43,989
case hadn't asked him about it.

821
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:49,189
At the time Gregor's only concern had beento use everything he had in order to allow

822
01:06:49,189 --> 01:06:54,004
his family to forget as quickly as possiblethe business misfortune which had brought

823
01:06:54,004 --> 01:06:58,759
them all into a state of completehopelessness.

824
01:06:58,759 --> 01:07:04,089
And so at that point he'd started to workwith a special intensity and from an

825
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:09,609
assistant had become, almost overnight, atravelling salesman, who naturally had

826
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,092
entirely different possibilities for

827
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:17,449
earning money and whose successes at workwere converted immediately into the form of

828
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:22,689
cash commissions, which could be set out onthe table at home in front of his

829
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:24,779
astonished and delighted family.

830
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:33,439
Those had been beautiful days, and they hadnever come back afterwards, at least not

831
01:07:33,439 --> 01:07:39,349
with the same splendour, in spite of thefact that Gregor later earned so much money

832
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:41,079
that he was in a position to bear the

833
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:47,429
expenses of the entire family, costs whichhe, in fact, did bear.

834
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:52,769
They had become quite accustomed to it,both the family and Gregor as well.

835
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:58,039
They took the money with thanks, and hehappily surrendered it, but the special

836
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:01,089
warmth was no longer present.

837
01:08:01,089 --> 01:08:07,219
Only the sister had remained still close toGregor, and it was his secret plan to send

838
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:12,041
her next year to the conservatory,regardless of the great expense which that

839
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:18,019
necessarily involved and which would bemade up in other ways.

840
01:08:18,019 --> 01:08:24,012
In contrast to Gregor she loved music verymuch and knew how to play the violin

841
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:25,087
charmingly.

842
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:31,062
Now and then during Gregor's short stays inthe city the conservatory was mentioned in

843
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:37,004
conversations with his sister, but alwaysonly as a beautiful dream, whose

844
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:40,015
realization was unimaginable, and their

845
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:46,000
parents never listened to these innocentexpectations with pleasure.

846
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,016
But Gregor thought about them withscrupulous consideration and intended to

847
01:08:51,016 --> 01:08:56,839
explain the matter ceremoniously onChristmas Eve.

848
01:08:56,839 --> 01:09:03,042
In his present situation, such futile ideaswent through his head, while he pushed

849
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:08,001
himself right up against the door andlistened.

850
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:12,009
Sometimes in his general exhaustion hecouldn't listen any more and let his head

851
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:19,002
bang listlessly against the door, but heimmediately pulled himself together, for

852
01:09:19,002 --> 01:09:21,048
even the small sound which he made by this

853
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:25,052
motion was heard near by and silencedeveryone.

854
01:09:25,052 --> 01:09:32,071
"There he goes on again," said his fatherafter a while, clearly turning towards the

855
01:09:32,071 --> 01:09:40,085
door, and only then would the interruptedconversation gradually be resumed again.

856
01:09:40,085 --> 01:09:46,042
Gregor found out clearly enough--for hisfather tended to repeat himself often in

857
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:51,005
his explanations, partly because he had notpersonally concerned himself with these

858
01:09:51,005 --> 01:09:54,005
matters for a long time now, and partly

859
01:09:54,005 --> 01:10:00,077
also because his mother did not understandeverything right away the first time--that,

860
01:10:00,077 --> 01:10:07,005
in spite all bad luck, a fortune, althougha very small one, was available from the

861
01:10:07,005 --> 01:10:11,002
old times, which the interest, which had

862
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:16,027
not been touched, had in the interveningtime gradually allowed to increase a

863
01:10:16,027 --> 01:10:16,056
little.

864
01:10:16,056 --> 01:10:23,069
Furthermore, in addition to this, the moneywhich Gregor had brought home every month--

865
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:29,009
he had kept only a few florins for himself--had not been completely spent and had

866
01:10:29,009 --> 01:10:33,062
grown into a small capital amount.

867
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:40,044
Gregor, behind his door, nodded eagerly,rejoicing over this unanticipated foresight

868
01:10:40,044 --> 01:10:42,042
and frugality.

869
01:10:42,042 --> 01:10:47,029
True, with this excess money, he could havepaid off more of his father's debt to his

870
01:10:47,029 --> 01:10:51,096
employer and the day on which he could berid of this position would have been a lot

871
01:10:51,096 --> 01:10:54,091
closer, but now things were doubtless

872
01:10:54,091 --> 01:10:56,098
better the way his father had arrangedthem.

873
01:10:56,098 --> 01:11:04,033
At the moment, however, this money was notnearly sufficient to permit the family to

874
01:11:04,033 --> 01:11:07,025
live on the interest payments.

875
01:11:07,025 --> 01:11:13,042
Perhaps it would be enough to maintain thefamily for one or at most two years, that's

876
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:13,083
all.

877
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:19,072
Thus, it only added up to an amount whichone should not really draw upon and which

878
01:11:19,072 --> 01:11:26,065
must be set aside for an emergency.But the money to live on had to be earned.

879
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:32,031
Now, although his father was old, he was ahealthy man who had not worked at all for

880
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:37,053
five years and thus could not be counted onfor very much.

881
01:11:37,053 --> 01:11:42,042
He had in these five years, the firstholidays of his trouble-filled but

882
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:50,015
unsuccessful life, put on a good deal offat and thus had become really heavy.

883
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:54,081
And should his old mother now perhaps workfor money, a woman who suffered from

884
01:11:54,081 --> 01:12:01,000
asthma, for whom wandering through theapartment even now was a great strain and

885
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,009
who spent every second day on the sofa bythe open window labouring for breath?

886
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:13,034
Should his sister earn money, a girl whowas still a seventeen-year-old child whose

887
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:18,024
earlier life style had been so verydelightful that it had consisted of

888
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:22,003
dressing herself nicely, sleeping in late,

889
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:28,023
helping around the house, taking part in afew modest enjoyments and, above all,

890
01:12:28,023 --> 01:12:30,008
playing the violin?

891
01:12:30,008 --> 01:12:36,029
When it came to talking about this need toearn money, at first Gregor went away from

892
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:41,096
the door and threw himself on the coolleather sofa beside the door, for he was

893
01:12:41,096 --> 01:12:45,008
quite hot from shame and sorrow.

894
01:12:45,008 --> 01:12:51,094
Often he lay there all night long.He didn't sleep a moment and just scratched

895
01:12:51,094 --> 01:12:57,087
on the leather for hours at a time.He undertook the very difficult task of

896
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,079
shoving a chair over to the window.

897
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:06,058
Then he crept up on the window sill and,braced in the chair, leaned against the

898
01:13:06,058 --> 01:13:12,042
window to look out, obviously with somememory or other of the satisfaction which

899
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:17,029
that used to bring him in earlier times.

900
01:13:17,029 --> 01:13:22,068
Actually, from day to day he perceivedthings with less and less clarity, even

901
01:13:22,068 --> 01:13:28,045
those a short distance away: the hospitalacross the street, the all-too-frequent

902
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:31,056
sight of which he had previously cursed,

903
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:37,024
was not visible at all any more, and if hehad not been precisely aware that he lived

904
01:13:37,024 --> 01:13:43,001
in the quiet but completely urban CharlotteStreet, he could have believed that from

905
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,073
his window he was peering out at a

906
01:13:45,073 --> 01:13:51,075
featureless wasteland, in which the greyheaven and the grey earth had merged and

907
01:13:51,075 --> 01:13:54,035
were indistinguishable.

908
01:13:54,035 --> 01:14:00,002
His attentive sister must have observed acouple of times that the chair stood by the

909
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:06,024
window; then, after cleaning up the room,each time she pushed the chair back right

910
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:11,016
against the window and from now on she evenleft the inner casement open.

911
01:14:11,016 --> 01:14:18,066
If Gregor had only been able to speak tohis sister and thank her for everything

912
01:14:18,066 --> 01:14:24,044
that she had to do for him, he would havetolerated her service more easily.

913
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:27,064
As it was, he suffered under it.

914
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:32,004
The sister admittedly sought to cover upthe awkwardness of everything as much as

915
01:14:32,004 --> 01:14:37,055
possible, and, as time went by, shenaturally got more successful at it.

916
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:42,076
But with the passing of time Gregor alsocame to understand everything more

917
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:48,029
precisely.Even her entrance was terrible for him.

918
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:53,037
As soon as she entered, she ran straight tothe window, without taking the time to shut

919
01:14:53,037 --> 01:14:58,085
the door, in spite of the fact that she wasotherwise very considerate in sparing

920
01:14:58,085 --> 01:15:01,093
anyone the sight of Gregor's room, and

921
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:08,015
yanked the window open with eager hands, asif she was almost suffocating, and remained

922
01:15:08,015 --> 01:15:15,000
for a while by the window breathing deeply,even when it was still so cold.

923
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,089
With this running and noise she frightenedGregor twice every day.

924
01:15:20,089 --> 01:15:26,033
The entire time he trembled under thecouch, and yet he knew very well that she

925
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:31,027
would certainly have spared him gladly ifit had only been possible to remain with

926
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:36,039
the window closed in a room where Gregorlived.

927
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:41,079
On one occasion--about one month hadalready gone by since Gregor's

928
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:45,085
transformation, and there was now noparticular reason any more for his sister

929
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:49,015
to be startled at Gregor's appearance--she

930
01:15:49,015 --> 01:15:54,006
arrived a little earlier than usual andcame upon Gregor as he was still looking

931
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:58,079
out the window, immobile and wellpositioned to frighten someone.

932
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,097
It would not have come as a surprise toGregor if she had not come in, since his

933
01:16:04,097 --> 01:16:09,096
position was preventing her from openingthe window immediately.

934
01:16:09,096 --> 01:16:16,046
But she not only did not step inside; sheeven retreated and shut the door.

935
01:16:16,046 --> 01:16:21,066
A stranger really might have concluded fromthis that Gregor had been lying in wait for

936
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:24,098
her and wanted to bite her.

937
01:16:24,098 --> 01:16:30,005
Of course, Gregor immediately concealedhimself under the couch, but he had to wait

938
01:16:30,005 --> 01:16:36,035
until the noon meal before his sisterreturned, and she seemed much less calm

939
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:38,044
than usual.

940
01:16:38,044 --> 01:16:44,075
From this he realized that his appearancewas still constantly intolerable to her and

941
01:16:44,075 --> 01:16:50,083
must remain intolerable in future, and thatshe really had to exert a lot of self-

942
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:54,016
control not to run away from a glimpse of

943
01:16:54,016 --> 01:16:59,009
only the small part of his body which stuckout from under the couch.

944
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:06,085
In order to spare her even this sight, oneday he dragged the sheet on his back and

945
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:13,078
onto the couch--this task took him fourhours--and arranged it in such a way that

946
01:17:13,078 --> 01:17:17,001
he was now completely concealed and his

947
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:20,071
sister, even if she bent down, could notsee him.

948
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:26,099
If this sheet was not necessary as far asshe was concerned, then she could remove

949
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:31,099
it, for it was clear enough that Gregorcould not derive any pleasure from

950
01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:35,042
isolating himself away so completely.

951
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:41,017
But she left the sheet just as it was, andGregor believed he even caught a look of

952
01:17:41,017 --> 01:17:47,015
gratitude when, on one occasion, hecarefully lifted up the sheet a little with

953
01:17:47,015 --> 01:17:55,026
his head to check, as his sister took stockof the new arrangement.

954
01:17:55,026 --> 01:18:00,095
In the first two weeks his parents couldnot bring themselves to visit him, and he

955
01:18:00,095 --> 01:18:07,045
often heard how they fully acknowledged hissister's present work; whereas, earlier

956
01:18:07,045 --> 01:18:10,039
they had often got annoyed at his sister

957
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:15,037
because she had seemed to them a somewhatuseless young woman.

958
01:18:15,037 --> 01:18:21,038
However, now both his father and his motheroften waited in front of Gregor's door

959
01:18:21,038 --> 01:18:26,068
while his sister cleaned up inside, and assoon as she came out, she had to explain in

960
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:30,004
detail how things looked in the room, what

961
01:18:30,004 --> 01:18:35,045
Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved thistime, and whether perhaps a slight

962
01:18:35,045 --> 01:18:38,006
improvement was perceptible.

963
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:44,006
In any event, his mother comparatively soonwanted to visit Gregor, but his father and

964
01:18:44,006 --> 01:18:50,015
his sister restrained her, at first withreasons which Gregor listened to very

965
01:18:50,015 --> 01:18:54,052
attentively and which he completelyendorsed.

966
01:18:54,052 --> 01:19:00,025
Later, however, they had to hold her backforcefully, and when she then cried "Let me

967
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:01,048
go to Gregor.

968
01:19:01,048 --> 01:19:05,043
He's my unlucky son!Don't you understand that I have to go to

969
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:06,092
him?"

970
01:19:06,092 --> 01:19:11,023
Gregor then thought that perhaps it wouldbe a good thing if his mother came in, not

971
01:19:11,023 --> 01:19:14,077
every day, of course, but maybe once aweek.

972
01:19:14,077 --> 01:19:20,027
She understood everything much better thanhis sister, who, in spite of all her

973
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:26,033
courage, was still a child and, in the lastanalysis, had perhaps undertaken such a

974
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:30,025
difficult task only out of childishrecklessness.

975
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:37,056
Gregor's wish to see his mother was soonrealized.

976
01:19:37,056 --> 01:19:43,027
While during the day Gregor, out ofconsideration for his parents, did not want

977
01:19:43,027 --> 01:19:48,083
to show himself by the window, he couldn'tcrawl around very much on the few square

978
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,094
metres of the floor.

979
01:19:50,094 --> 01:19:56,087
He found it difficult to bear lying quietlyduring the night, and soon eating no longer

980
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:59,063
gave him the slightest pleasure.

981
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:05,046
So for diversion he acquired the habit ofcrawling back and forth across the walls

982
01:20:05,046 --> 01:20:09,054
and ceiling.He was especially fond of hanging from the

983
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,038
ceiling.

984
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:14,016
The experience was quite different fromlying on the floor.

985
01:20:14,016 --> 01:20:20,042
It was easier to breathe, a slightvibration went through his body, and in the

986
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:26,017
midst of the almost happy amusement whichGregor found up there, it could happen

987
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:32,004
that, to his own surprise, he let go andhit the floor.

988
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:37,013
However, now he naturally controlled hisbody quite differently, and he did not

989
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:41,000
injure himself in such a great fall.

990
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,063
His sister noticed immediately the newamusement which Gregor had found for

991
01:20:46,063 --> 01:20:51,039
himself--for as he crept around he leftbehind here and there traces of his sticky

992
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,067
stuff--and so she got the idea of making

993
01:20:54,067 --> 01:21:00,057
Gregor's creeping around as easy aspossible and thus of removing the furniture

994
01:21:00,057 --> 01:21:06,098
which got in the way, especially the chestof drawers and the writing desk.

995
01:21:06,098 --> 01:21:10,079
But she was in no position to do this byherself.

996
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:16,008
She did not dare to ask her father to help,and the servant girl would certainly not

997
01:21:16,008 --> 01:21:22,031
have assisted her, for although this girl,about sixteen years old, had courageously

998
01:21:22,031 --> 01:21:24,038
remained since the dismissal of the

999
01:21:24,038 --> 01:21:28,067
previous cook, she had begged for theprivilege of being allowed to stay

1000
01:21:28,067 --> 01:21:34,063
permanently confined to the kitchen and ofhaving to open the door only in answer to a

1001
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:35,063
special summons.

1002
01:21:35,063 --> 01:21:42,075
Thus, his sister had no other choice but toinvolve his mother while his father was

1003
01:21:42,075 --> 01:21:44,079
absent.

1004
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:51,019
His mother approached Gregor's room withcries of excited joy, but she fell silent

1005
01:21:51,019 --> 01:21:55,077
at the door.Of course, his sister first checked whether

1006
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,075
everything in the room was in order.

1007
01:21:57,075 --> 01:22:04,006
Only then did she let his mother walk in.In great haste Gregor had drawn the sheet

1008
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:10,083
down even further and wrinkled it more.The whole thing really looked just like a

1009
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:14,098
coverlet thrown carelessly over the couch.

1010
01:22:14,098 --> 01:22:20,046
On this occasion, Gregor held back fromspying out from under the sheet.

1011
01:22:20,046 --> 01:22:25,081
Thus, he refrained from looking at hismother this time and was just happy that

1012
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:28,034
she had come.

1013
01:22:28,034 --> 01:22:33,015
"Come on; he's not visible," said hissister, and evidently led his mother by the

1014
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:34,055
hand.

1015
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:40,076
Now Gregor listened as these two weak womenshifted the still heavy old chest of

1016
01:22:40,076 --> 01:22:45,046
drawers from its position, and as hissister constantly took on herself the

1017
01:22:45,046 --> 01:22:48,091
greater part of the work, without listening

1018
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:55,014
to the warnings of his mother, who wasafraid that she would strain herself.

1019
01:22:55,014 --> 01:22:57,067
The work lasted a long time.

1020
01:22:57,067 --> 01:23:02,015
After about a quarter of an hour hadalready gone by, his mother said it would

1021
01:23:02,015 --> 01:23:08,017
be better if they left the chest of drawerswhere it was, because, in the first place,

1022
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:10,054
it was too heavy: they would not be

1023
01:23:10,054 --> 01:23:15,044
finished before his father's arrival, andleaving the chest of drawers in the middle

1024
01:23:15,044 --> 01:23:20,056
of the room would block all Gregor'spathways, but, in the second place, they

1025
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:25,009
could not be certain that Gregor would bepleased with the removal of the furniture.

1026
01:23:25,009 --> 01:23:32,009
To her the reverse seemed to be true; thesight of the empty walls pierced her right

1027
01:23:32,009 --> 01:23:37,077
to the heart, and why should Gregor notfeel the same, since he had been accustomed

1028
01:23:37,077 --> 01:23:40,096
to the room furnishings for a long time and

1029
01:23:40,096 --> 01:23:45,055
in an empty room would feel himselfabandoned?

1030
01:23:45,055 --> 01:23:51,042
"And is it not the case," his motherconcluded very quietly, almost whispering

1031
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:57,004
as if she wished to prevent Gregor, whoseexact location she really didn't know, from

1032
01:23:57,004 --> 01:24:00,073
hearing even the sound of her voice--for

1033
01:24:00,073 --> 01:24:05,046
she was convinced that he did notunderstand her words--"and isn't it a fact

1034
01:24:05,046 --> 01:24:10,001
that by removing the furniture we'reshowing that we're giving up all hope of an

1035
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:16,017
improvement and are leaving him to his ownresources without any consideration?

1036
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:20,052
I think it would be best if we tried tokeep the room exactly in the condition it

1037
01:24:20,052 --> 01:24:27,001
was in before, so that, when Gregor returnsto us, he finds everything unchanged and

1038
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:31,084
can forget the intervening time all themore easily."

1039
01:24:31,084 --> 01:24:37,023
As he heard his mother's words Gregorrealized that the lack of all immediate

1040
01:24:37,023 --> 01:24:43,032
human contact, together with the monotonouslife surrounded by the family over the

1041
01:24:43,032 --> 01:24:46,013
course of these two months, must have

1042
01:24:46,013 --> 01:24:51,038
confused his understanding, becauseotherwise he couldn't explain to himself

1043
01:24:51,038 --> 01:24:57,098
how he, in all seriousness, could have beenso keen to have his room emptied.

1044
01:24:57,098 --> 01:25:03,085
Was he really eager to let the warm room,comfortably furnished with pieces he had

1045
01:25:03,085 --> 01:25:09,083
inherited, be turned into a cavern in whichhe would, of course, then be able to crawl

1046
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:11,006
about in all directions without

1047
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:17,067
disturbance, but at the same time with aquick and complete forgetting of his human

1048
01:25:17,067 --> 01:25:18,082
past as well?

1049
01:25:18,082 --> 01:25:25,094
Was he then at this point already on theverge of forgetting and was it only the

1050
01:25:25,094 --> 01:25:32,099
voice of his mother, which he had not heardfor a long time, that had aroused him?

1051
01:25:32,099 --> 01:25:37,017
Nothing was to be removed--everything mustremain.

1052
01:25:37,017 --> 01:25:41,053
In his condition he could not functionwithout the beneficial influences of his

1053
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:42,067
furniture.

1054
01:25:42,067 --> 01:25:47,083
And if the furniture prevented him fromcarrying out his senseless crawling about

1055
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:53,002
all over the place, then there was no harmin that, but rather a great benefit.

1056
01:25:53,002 --> 01:25:59,046
But his sister unfortunately thoughtotherwise.

1057
01:25:59,046 --> 01:26:04,069
She had grown accustomed, certainly notwithout justification, so far as the

1058
01:26:04,069 --> 01:26:10,085
discussion of matters concerning Gregor wasconcerned, to act as an special expert with

1059
01:26:10,085 --> 01:26:14,019
respect to their parents, and so now the

1060
01:26:14,019 --> 01:26:19,029
mother's advice was for his sistersufficient reason to insist on the removal,

1061
01:26:19,029 --> 01:26:24,079
not only of the chest of drawers and thewriting desk, which were the only items she

1062
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,006
had thought about at first, but also of all

1063
01:26:28,006 --> 01:26:33,017
the furniture, with the exception of theindispensable couch.

1064
01:26:33,017 --> 01:26:39,019
Of course, it was not only childishdefiance and her recent very unexpected and

1065
01:26:39,019 --> 01:26:43,071
hard won self-confidence which led her tothis demand.

1066
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:49,079
She had also actually observed that Gregorneeded a great deal of room to creep about;

1067
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:55,013
the furniture, on the other hand, as far asone could see, was not of the slightest

1068
01:26:55,013 --> 01:26:57,066
use.

1069
01:26:57,066 --> 01:27:05,031
But perhaps the enthusiastic sensibility ofyoung women of her age also played a role.

1070
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:11,006
This feeling sought release at everyopportunity, and with it Grete now felt

1071
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:16,098
tempted to want to make Gregor's situationeven more terrifying, so that then she

1072
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:20,051
would be able to do even more for him thannow.

1073
01:27:20,051 --> 01:27:26,004
For surely no one except Grete would evertrust themselves to enter a room in which

1074
01:27:26,004 --> 01:27:30,045
Gregor ruled the empty walls all byhimself.

1075
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:35,093
And so she did not let herself be dissuadedfrom her decision by her mother, who in

1076
01:27:35,093 --> 01:27:43,027
this room seemed uncertain of herself inher sheer agitation and soon kept quiet,

1077
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:50,001
helping his sister with all her energy toget the chest of drawers out of the room.

1078
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:55,068
Now, Gregor could still do without thechest of drawers if need be, but the

1079
01:27:55,068 --> 01:27:58,078
writing desk really had to stay.

1080
01:27:58,078 --> 01:28:03,047
And scarcely had the women left the roomwith the chest of drawers, groaning as they

1081
01:28:03,047 --> 01:28:09,072
pushed it, when Gregor stuck his head outfrom under the sofa to take a look how he

1082
01:28:09,072 --> 01:28:15,039
could intervene cautiously and with as muchconsideration as possible.

1083
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:21,063
But unfortunately it was his mother whocame back into the room first, while Grete

1084
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:26,086
had her arms wrapped around the chest ofdrawers in the next room and was rocking it

1085
01:28:26,086 --> 01:28:32,061
back and forth by herself, without movingit from its position.

1086
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:38,045
His mother was not used to the sight ofGregor; he could have made her ill, and so,

1087
01:28:38,045 --> 01:28:44,052
frightened, Gregor scurried backwards rightto the other end of the sofa, but he could

1088
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:48,094
no longer prevent the sheet from movingforward a little.

1089
01:28:48,094 --> 01:28:52,034
That was enough to catch his mother'sattention.

1090
01:28:52,034 --> 01:28:57,087
She came to a halt, stood still for amoment, and then went back to Grete.

1091
01:28:57,087 --> 01:29:05,084
Although Gregor kept repeating to himselfover and over that really nothing unusual

1092
01:29:05,084 --> 01:29:12,044
was going on, that only a few pieces offurniture were being rearranged, he soon

1093
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:15,005
had to admit to himself that the movements

1094
01:29:15,005 --> 01:29:21,094
of the women to and fro, their quietconversations, and the scratching of the

1095
01:29:21,094 --> 01:29:28,047
furniture on the floor affected him like agreat swollen commotion on all sides, and,

1096
01:29:28,047 --> 01:29:31,045
so firmly was he pulling in his head and

1097
01:29:31,045 --> 01:29:37,086
legs and pressing his body into the floor,he had to tell himself unequivocally that

1098
01:29:37,086 --> 01:29:40,082
he wouldn't be able to endure all this muchlonger.

1099
01:29:40,082 --> 01:29:48,032
They were cleaning out his room, takingaway from him everything he cherished; they

1100
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:53,017
had already dragged out the chest ofdrawers in which the fret saw and other

1101
01:29:53,017 --> 01:29:55,034
tools were kept, and they were now

1102
01:29:55,034 --> 01:30:01,013
loosening the writing desk which was fixedtight to the floor, the desk on which he,

1103
01:30:01,013 --> 01:30:06,028
as a business student, a school student,indeed even as an elementary school

1104
01:30:06,028 --> 01:30:09,073
student, had written out his assignments.

1105
01:30:09,073 --> 01:30:15,036
At that moment he really didn't have anymore time to check the good intentions of

1106
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:20,084
the two women, whose existence he had inany case almost forgotten, because in their

1107
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:22,096
exhaustion they were working really

1108
01:30:22,096 --> 01:30:29,082
silently, and the heavy stumbling of theirfeet was the only sound to be heard.

1109
01:30:29,082 --> 01:30:34,099
And so he scuttled out--the women were justpropping themselves up on the writing desk

1110
01:30:34,099 --> 01:30:39,065
in the next room in order to take abreather--changing the direction of his

1111
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:41,009
path four times.

1112
01:30:41,009 --> 01:30:45,063
He really didn't know what he should rescuefirst.

1113
01:30:45,063 --> 01:30:51,042
Then he saw hanging conspicuously on thewall, which was otherwise already empty,

1114
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:55,002
the picture of the woman dressed in nothingbut fur.

1115
01:30:55,002 --> 01:31:00,055
He quickly scurried up over it and pressedhimself against the glass which held it in

1116
01:31:00,055 --> 01:31:05,017
place and which made his hot abdomen feelgood.

1117
01:31:05,017 --> 01:31:11,063
At least this picture, which Gregor at themoment completely concealed, surely no one

1118
01:31:11,063 --> 01:31:13,094
would now take away.

1119
01:31:13,094 --> 01:31:18,086
He twisted his head towards the door of theliving room to observe the women as they

1120
01:31:18,086 --> 01:31:23,019
came back in.They had not allowed themselves very much

1121
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:26,067
rest and were coming back right away.

1122
01:31:26,067 --> 01:31:31,025
Grete had placed her arm around her motherand held her tightly.

1123
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:36,057
"So what shall we take now?" said Grete andlooked around her.

1124
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:40,025
Then her glance met Gregor's from the wall.

1125
01:31:40,025 --> 01:31:43,034
She kept her composure only because hermother was there.

1126
01:31:43,034 --> 01:31:48,019
She bent her face towards her mother inorder to prevent her from looking around,

1127
01:31:48,019 --> 01:31:53,081
and said, although in a trembling voice andtoo quickly, "Come, wouldn't it be better

1128
01:31:53,081 --> 01:31:56,013
to go back to the living room for justanother moment?"

1129
01:31:56,013 --> 01:32:02,059
Grete's purpose was clear to Gregor: shewanted to bring his mother to a safe place

1130
01:32:02,059 --> 01:32:05,055
and then chase him down from the wall.

1131
01:32:05,055 --> 01:32:12,001
Well, let her just try!He squatted on his picture and did not hand

1132
01:32:12,001 --> 01:32:17,098
it over.He would sooner spring into Grete's face.

1133
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:22,003
But Grete's words had immediately made themother very uneasy.

1134
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:28,027
She walked to the side, caught sight of theenormous brown splotch on the flowered

1135
01:32:28,027 --> 01:32:33,017
wallpaper, and, before she became trulyaware that what she was looking at was

1136
01:32:33,017 --> 01:32:37,005
Gregor, screamed out in a high pitched raw

1137
01:32:37,005 --> 01:32:42,077
voice "Oh God, oh God" and fell withoutstretched arms, as if she was

1138
01:32:42,077 --> 01:32:48,086
surrendering everything, down onto thecouch and lay there motionless.

1139
01:32:48,086 --> 01:32:50,054
"Gregor, you.

1140
01:32:50,054 --> 01:32:52,091
.." cried out his sister with a raised fist

1141
01:32:52,091 --> 01:32:54,094
and an urgent glare.

1142
01:32:54,094 --> 01:32:59,093
Since his transformation these were thefirst words which she had directed right at

1143
01:32:59,093 --> 01:33:00,095
him.

1144
01:33:00,095 --> 01:33:05,005
She ran into the room next door to bringsome spirits or other with which she could

1145
01:33:05,005 --> 01:33:09,018
revive her mother from her fainting spell.

1146
01:33:09,018 --> 01:33:14,068
Gregor wanted to help as well--there wastime enough to save the picture--but he was

1147
01:33:14,068 --> 01:33:20,001
stuck fast on the glass and had to tearhimself loose forcefully.

1148
01:33:20,001 --> 01:33:25,028
Then he also scurried into the next room,as if he could give his sister some advice,

1149
01:33:25,028 --> 01:33:31,016
as in earlier times, but then he had tostand there idly behind her, while she

1150
01:33:31,016 --> 01:33:34,081
rummaged about among various small bottles.

1151
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:37,072
Still, she was frightened when she turnedaround.

1152
01:33:37,072 --> 01:33:41,012
A bottle fell onto the floor and shattered.

1153
01:33:41,012 --> 01:33:47,005
A splinter of glass wounded Gregor in theface, some corrosive medicine or other

1154
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:49,033
dripped over him.

1155
01:33:49,033 --> 01:33:54,037
Now, without lingering any longer, Gretetook as many small bottles as she could

1156
01:33:54,037 --> 01:34:01,018
hold and ran with them into her mother.She slammed the door shut with her foot.

1157
01:34:01,018 --> 01:34:07,008
Gregor was now shut off from his mother,who was perhaps near death, thanks to him.

1158
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:13,013
He could not open the door, and he did notwant to chase away his sister who had to

1159
01:34:13,013 --> 01:34:14,083
remain with her mother.

1160
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:20,065
At this point he had nothing to do butwait, and overwhelmed with self-reproach

1161
01:34:20,065 --> 01:34:28,086
and worry, he began to creep and crawl overeverything: walls, furniture, and ceiling.

1162
01:34:28,086 --> 01:34:36,042
Finally, in his despair, as the entire roomstarted to spin around him, he fell onto

1163
01:34:36,042 --> 01:34:43,009
the middle of the large table.A short time elapsed.

1164
01:34:43,009 --> 01:34:45,074
Gregor lay there limply.

1165
01:34:45,074 --> 01:34:50,095
All around was still.Perhaps that was a good sign.

1166
01:34:50,095 --> 01:34:52,094
Then there was ring at the door.

1167
01:34:52,094 --> 01:34:58,007
The servant girl was naturally shut up inher kitchen, and therefore Grete had to go

1168
01:34:58,007 --> 01:35:03,031
to open the door.The father had arrived.

1169
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:06,042
"What's happened?" were his first words.

1170
01:35:06,042 --> 01:35:13,013
Grete's appearance had told him everything.Grete replied with a dull voice; evidently

1171
01:35:13,013 --> 01:35:19,057
she was pressing her face into her father'schest: "Mother fainted, but she's getting

1172
01:35:19,057 --> 01:35:20,088
better now.

1173
01:35:20,088 --> 01:35:26,051
Gregor has broken loose.""Yes, I have expected that," said his

1174
01:35:26,051 --> 01:35:32,074
father, "I always told you that, but youwomen don't want to listen."

1175
01:35:32,074 --> 01:35:38,026
It was clear to Gregor that his father hadbadly misunderstood Grete's short message

1176
01:35:38,026 --> 01:35:43,011
and was assuming that Gregor had committedsome violent crime or other.

1177
01:35:43,011 --> 01:35:49,061
Thus, Gregor now had to find his father tocalm him down, for he had neither the time

1178
01:35:49,061 --> 01:35:53,002
nor the ability to explain things to him.

1179
01:35:53,002 --> 01:35:58,082
And so he rushed away to the door of hisroom and pushed himself against it, so that

1180
01:35:58,082 --> 01:36:03,016
his father could see right away as heentered from the hall that Gregor fully

1181
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:06,099
intended to return at once to his room,

1182
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:12,028
that it was not necessary to drive himback, but that one only needed to open the

1183
01:36:12,028 --> 01:36:19,007
door, and he would disappear immediately.But his father was not in the mood to

1184
01:36:19,007 --> 01:36:20,087
observe such niceties.

1185
01:36:20,087 --> 01:36:27,005
"Ah," he yelled as soon as he entered, witha tone as if he were all at once angry and

1186
01:36:27,005 --> 01:36:28,043
pleased.

1187
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:34,076
Gregor pulled his head back from the doorand raised it in the direction of his

1188
01:36:34,076 --> 01:36:37,083
father.He had not really pictured his father as he

1189
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,052
now stood there.

1190
01:36:39,052 --> 01:36:45,034
Of course, what with his new style ofcreeping all around, he had in the past

1191
01:36:45,034 --> 01:36:50,031
while neglected to pay attention to whatwas going on in the rest of the apartment,

1192
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:53,012
as he had done before, and really should

1193
01:36:53,012 --> 01:36:58,032
have grasped the fact that he wouldencounter different conditions.

1194
01:36:58,032 --> 01:37:02,032
Nevertheless, nevertheless, was that stillhis father?

1195
01:37:02,032 --> 01:37:07,078
Was that the same man who had lainexhausted and buried in bed in earlier days

1196
01:37:07,078 --> 01:37:12,095
when Gregor was setting out on a businesstrip, who had received him on the evenings

1197
01:37:12,095 --> 01:37:16,054
of his return in a sleeping gown and arm

1198
01:37:16,054 --> 01:37:22,028
chair, totally incapable of standing up,who had only lifted his arm as a sign of

1199
01:37:22,028 --> 01:37:28,076
happiness, and who in their rare strollstogether a few Sundays a year and on the

1200
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:32,009
important holidays made his way slowly

1201
01:37:32,009 --> 01:37:38,077
forwards between Gregor and his mother--whothemselves moved slowly--always a bit more

1202
01:37:38,077 --> 01:37:45,018
slowly than them, bundled up in his oldcoat, all the time setting down his walking

1203
01:37:45,018 --> 01:37:48,021
stick carefully, and who, when he had

1204
01:37:48,021 --> 01:37:53,081
wanted to say something, almost alwaysstood still and gathered his entourage

1205
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:55,086
around him?

1206
01:37:55,086 --> 01:38:02,042
But now he was standing up really straight,dressed in a tight-fitting blue uniform

1207
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:07,067
with gold buttons, like the ones servantswear in a banking company.

1208
01:38:07,067 --> 01:38:14,057
Above the high stiff collar of his jackethis firm double chin stuck out prominently,

1209
01:38:14,057 --> 01:38:20,025
beneath his bushy eyebrows the glance ofhis black eyes was freshly penetrating and

1210
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:24,000
alert, his otherwise dishevelled white hair

1211
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,022
was combed down into a carefully exactshining part.

1212
01:38:29,022 --> 01:38:35,011
He threw his cap, on which a gold monogram,apparently the symbol of the bank, was

1213
01:38:35,011 --> 01:38:42,005
affixed, in an arc across the entire roomonto the sofa and moved, throwing back the

1214
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:45,008
edge of the long coat of his uniform, with

1215
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:52,038
his hands in his trouser pockets and a grimface, right up to Gregor.

1216
01:38:52,038 --> 01:38:58,026
He really didn't know what he had in mind,but he raised his foot uncommonly high

1217
01:38:58,026 --> 01:39:05,055
anyway, and Gregor was astonished at thegigantic size of the sole of his boot.

1218
01:39:05,055 --> 01:39:08,004
However, he did not linger on that point.

1219
01:39:08,004 --> 01:39:14,055
For he knew from the first day of his newlife that, as far as he was concerned, his

1220
01:39:14,055 --> 01:39:19,063
father considered the greatest force theonly appropriate response.

1221
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:24,084
And so he scurried away from his father,stopped when his father remained standing,

1222
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:29,078
and scampered forward again when his fathermerely stirred.

1223
01:39:29,078 --> 01:39:35,009
In this way they made their way around theroom repeatedly, without anything decisive

1224
01:39:35,009 --> 01:39:40,048
taking place.In fact, because of the slow pace, it

1225
01:39:40,048 --> 01:39:42,092
didn't look like a chase.

1226
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:48,045
Gregor remained on the floor for the timebeing, especially since he was afraid that

1227
01:39:48,045 --> 01:39:53,057
his father could take a flight up onto thewall or the ceiling as an act of real

1228
01:39:53,057 --> 01:39:55,013
malice.

1229
01:39:55,013 --> 01:39:59,009
At any event, Gregor had to tell himselfthat he couldn't keep up this running

1230
01:39:59,009 --> 01:40:05,055
around for a long time, because wheneverhis father took a single step, he had to go

1231
01:40:05,055 --> 01:40:08,097
through an enormous number of movements.

1232
01:40:08,097 --> 01:40:14,009
Already he was starting to suffer from ashortage of breath, just as in his earlier

1233
01:40:14,009 --> 01:40:18,054
days when his lungs had been quiteunreliable.

1234
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:23,085
As he now staggered around in this way inorder to gather all his energies for

1235
01:40:23,085 --> 01:40:30,009
running, hardly keeping his eyes open andfeeling so listless that he had no notion

1236
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:33,099
at all of any escape other than by running

1237
01:40:33,099 --> 01:40:39,025
and had almost already forgotten that thewalls were available to him, although they

1238
01:40:39,025 --> 01:40:44,007
were obstructed by carefully carvedfurniture full of sharp points and spikes,

1239
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:48,002
at that moment something or other thrown

1240
01:40:48,002 --> 01:40:53,088
casually flew down close by and rolled infront of him.

1241
01:40:53,088 --> 01:40:59,084
It was an apple.Immediately a second one flew after it.

1242
01:40:59,084 --> 01:41:02,044
Gregor stood still in fright.

1243
01:41:02,044 --> 01:41:08,072
Further running away was useless, for hisfather had decided to bombard him.

1244
01:41:08,072 --> 01:41:14,038
From the fruit bowl on the sideboard hisfather had filled his pockets.

1245
01:41:14,038 --> 01:41:19,083
And now, without for the moment takingaccurate aim, he was throwing apple after

1246
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:21,033
apple.

1247
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:26,008
These small red apples rolled around on thefloor, as if electrified, and collided with

1248
01:41:26,008 --> 01:41:31,048
each other.A weakly thrown apple grazed Gregor's back

1249
01:41:31,048 --> 01:41:34,054
but skidded off harmlessly.

1250
01:41:34,054 --> 01:41:40,046
However, another thrown immediately afterthat one drove into Gregor's back really

1251
01:41:40,046 --> 01:41:41,094
hard.

1252
01:41:41,094 --> 01:41:46,096
Gregor wanted to drag himself off, as ifthe unexpected and incredible pain would go

1253
01:41:46,096 --> 01:41:49,096
away if he changed his position.

1254
01:41:49,096 --> 01:41:56,014
But he felt as if he was nailed in placeand lay stretched out completely confused

1255
01:41:56,014 --> 01:41:57,094
in all his senses.

1256
01:41:57,094 --> 01:42:03,089
Only with his final glance did he noticehow the door of his room was pulled open

1257
01:42:03,089 --> 01:42:09,017
and how, right in front of his sister--whowas yelling--his mother ran out in her

1258
01:42:09,017 --> 01:42:11,088
undergarments, for his sister had undressed

1259
01:42:11,088 --> 01:42:17,046
her in order to give her some freedom tobreathe in her fainting spell, and how his

1260
01:42:17,046 --> 01:42:22,008
mother then ran up to his father, on theway her tied up skirts slipped toward the

1261
01:42:22,008 --> 01:42:25,054
floor one after the other, and how,

1262
01:42:25,054 --> 01:42:31,002
tripping over her skirts, she hurledherself onto his father and, throwing her

1263
01:42:31,002 --> 01:42:37,005
arms around him, in complete union withhim--but at this moment Gregor's powers of

1264
01:42:37,005 --> 01:42:40,037
sight gave way--as her hands reached to the

1265
01:42:40,037 --> 01:42:52,053
back of his father's head and she beggedhim to spare Gregor's life.

1266
01:42:52,053 --> 01:42:58,056
CHAPTER III.

1267
01:42:58,056 --> 01:43:06,002
Gregor's serious wound, from which hesuffered for over a month--since no one

1268
01:43:06,002 --> 01:43:11,099
ventured to remove the apple, it remainedin his flesh as a visible reminder--seemed

1269
01:43:11,099 --> 01:43:15,001
by itself to have reminded the father that,

1270
01:43:15,001 --> 01:43:20,063
in spite of his present unhappy and hatefulappearance, Gregor was a member of the

1271
01:43:20,063 --> 01:43:27,002
family, something one should not treat asan enemy, and that it was, on the contrary,

1272
01:43:27,002 --> 01:43:30,026
a requirement of family duty to suppress

1273
01:43:30,026 --> 01:43:37,043
one's aversion and to endure--nothing else,just endure.

1274
01:43:37,043 --> 01:43:42,035
And if through his wound Gregor had nowapparently lost for good his ability to

1275
01:43:42,035 --> 01:43:49,024
move and for the time being needed many,many minutes to crawl across his room, like

1276
01:43:49,024 --> 01:43:52,041
an aged invalid--so far as creeping up high

1277
01:43:52,041 --> 01:43:58,003
was concerned, that was unimaginable--nevertheless for this worsening of his

1278
01:43:58,003 --> 01:44:04,005
condition, in his opinion, he did getcompletely satisfactory compensation,

1279
01:44:04,005 --> 01:44:07,001
because every day towards evening the door

1280
01:44:07,001 --> 01:44:11,097
to the living room, which he was in thehabit of keeping a sharp eye on even one or

1281
01:44:11,097 --> 01:44:18,099
two hours beforehand, was opened, so thathe, lying down in the darkness of his room,

1282
01:44:18,099 --> 01:44:22,006
invisible from the living room, could see

1283
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:28,067
the entire family at the illuminated tableand listen to their conversation, to a

1284
01:44:28,067 --> 01:44:33,068
certain extent with their commonpermission, a situation quite different

1285
01:44:33,068 --> 01:44:37,043
from what had happened before.

1286
01:44:37,043 --> 01:44:42,096
Of course, it was no longer the animatedsocial interaction of former times, which

1287
01:44:42,096 --> 01:44:48,004
Gregor in small hotel rooms had alwaysthought about with a certain longing, when,

1288
01:44:48,004 --> 01:44:54,047
tired out, he had had to throw himself intothe damp bedclothes.

1289
01:44:54,047 --> 01:44:57,037
For the most part what went on now was veryquiet.

1290
01:44:57,037 --> 01:45:03,063
After the evening meal, the father fellasleep quickly in his arm chair.

1291
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:09,033
The mother and sister talked guardedly toeach other in the stillness.

1292
01:45:09,033 --> 01:45:15,025
Bent far over, the mother sewed fineundergarments for a fashion shop.

1293
01:45:15,025 --> 01:45:20,019
The sister, who had taken on a job as asalesgirl, in the evening studied

1294
01:45:20,019 --> 01:45:27,084
stenography and French, so as perhaps laterto obtain a better position.

1295
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:33,000
Sometimes the father woke up and, as if hewas quite ignorant that he had been asleep,

1296
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,034
said to the mother "How long you have beensewing today?" and went right back to

1297
01:45:38,034 --> 01:45:45,018
sleep, while the mother and the sistersmiled tiredly to each other.

1298
01:45:45,018 --> 01:45:50,004
With a sort of stubbornness the fatherrefused to take off his servant's uniform

1299
01:45:50,004 --> 01:45:56,082
even at home, and while his sleeping gownhung unused on the coat hook, the father

1300
01:45:56,082 --> 01:46:00,036
dozed completely dressed in his place, as

1301
01:46:00,036 --> 01:46:05,002
if he was always ready for hisresponsibility and even here was waiting

1302
01:46:05,002 --> 01:46:08,024
for the voice of his superior.

1303
01:46:08,024 --> 01:46:14,028
As a result, in spite of all the care ofthe mother and sister, his uniform, which

1304
01:46:14,028 --> 01:46:20,084
even at the start was not new, grew dirty,and Gregor looked, often for the entire

1305
01:46:20,084 --> 01:46:24,011
evening, at this clothing, with stains all

1306
01:46:24,011 --> 01:46:30,026
over it and with its gold buttons alwayspolished, in which the old man, although

1307
01:46:30,026 --> 01:46:36,047
very uncomfortable, slept peacefullynonetheless.

1308
01:46:36,047 --> 01:46:41,074
As soon as the clock struck ten, the mothertried gently encouraging the father to wake

1309
01:46:41,074 --> 01:46:47,005
up and then persuading him to go to bed, onthe ground that he couldn't get a proper

1310
01:46:47,005 --> 01:46:50,014
sleep here and that the father, who had to

1311
01:46:50,014 --> 01:46:55,049
report for service at six o'clock, reallyneeded a good sleep.

1312
01:46:55,049 --> 01:47:00,003
But in his stubbornness, which had grippedhim since he had become a servant, he

1313
01:47:00,003 --> 01:47:05,093
insisted always on staying even longer bythe table, although he regularly fell

1314
01:47:05,093 --> 01:47:08,055
asleep and then could only be prevailed

1315
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:14,026
upon with the greatest difficulty to tradehis chair for the bed.

1316
01:47:14,026 --> 01:47:18,061
No matter how much the mother and sistermight at that point work on him with small

1317
01:47:18,061 --> 01:47:25,059
admonitions, for a quarter of an hour hewould remain shaking his head slowly, his

1318
01:47:25,059 --> 01:47:28,082
eyes closed, without standing up.

1319
01:47:28,082 --> 01:47:33,099
The mother would pull him by the sleeve andspeak flattering words into his ear; the

1320
01:47:33,099 --> 01:47:39,005
sister would leave her work to help hermother, but that would not have the desired

1321
01:47:39,005 --> 01:47:41,039
effect on the father.

1322
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,026
He would settle himself even more deeply inhis arm chair.

1323
01:47:45,026 --> 01:47:51,016
Only when the two women grabbed him underthe armpits would he throw his eyes open,

1324
01:47:51,016 --> 01:47:57,049
look back and forth at the mother andsister, and habitually say "This is a life.

1325
01:47:57,049 --> 01:48:02,032
This is the peace and quiet of my old age."

1326
01:48:02,032 --> 01:48:07,078
And propped up by both women, he wouldheave himself up elaborately, as if for him

1327
01:48:07,078 --> 01:48:13,007
it was the greatest trouble, allow himselfto be led to the door by the women, wave

1328
01:48:13,007 --> 01:48:16,047
them away there, and proceed on his own

1329
01:48:16,047 --> 01:48:21,036
from there, while the mother quickly threwdown her sewing implements and the sister

1330
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:27,092
her pen in order to run after the fatherand help him some more.

1331
01:48:27,092 --> 01:48:34,082
In this overworked and exhausted family whohad time to worry any longer about Gregor

1332
01:48:34,082 --> 01:48:39,065
more than was absolutely necessary?The household was constantly getting

1333
01:48:39,065 --> 01:48:40,095
smaller.

1334
01:48:40,095 --> 01:48:46,095
The servant girl was now let go.A huge bony cleaning woman with white hair

1335
01:48:46,095 --> 01:48:51,051
flying all over her head came in themorning and evening to do the heaviest

1336
01:48:51,051 --> 01:48:53,034
work.

1337
01:48:53,034 --> 01:48:59,003
The mother took care of everything else inaddition to her considerable sewing work.

1338
01:48:59,003 --> 01:49:03,076
It even happened that various pieces offamily jewellery, which previously the

1339
01:49:03,076 --> 01:49:09,013
mother and sister had been overjoyed towear on social and festive occasions, were

1340
01:49:09,013 --> 01:49:12,067
sold, as Gregor found out in the evening

1341
01:49:12,067 --> 01:49:15,059
from the general discussion of the pricesthey had fetched.

1342
01:49:15,059 --> 01:49:22,003
But the greatest complaint was always thatthey could not leave this apartment, which

1343
01:49:22,003 --> 01:49:28,006
was too big for their present means, sinceit was impossible to imagine how Gregor

1344
01:49:28,006 --> 01:49:29,089
might be moved.

1345
01:49:29,089 --> 01:49:35,027
But Gregor fully recognized that it was notjust consideration for him which was

1346
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:40,065
preventing a move, for he could have beentransported easily in a suitable box with a

1347
01:49:40,065 --> 01:49:41,053
few air holes.

1348
01:49:41,053 --> 01:49:47,096
The main thing holding the family back froma change in living quarters was far more

1349
01:49:47,096 --> 01:49:53,077
their complete hopelessness and the ideathat they had been struck by a misfortune

1350
01:49:53,077 --> 01:50:01,043
like no one else in their entire circle ofrelatives and acquaintances.

1351
01:50:01,043 --> 01:50:08,038
What the world demands of poor people theynow carried out to an extreme degree.

1352
01:50:08,038 --> 01:50:13,021
The father bought breakfast to the pettyofficials at the bank, the mother

1353
01:50:13,021 --> 01:50:19,034
sacrificed herself for the undergarments ofstrangers, the sister behind her desk was

1354
01:50:19,034 --> 01:50:23,001
at the beck and call of customers, but the

1355
01:50:23,001 --> 01:50:26,005
family's energies did not extend anyfurther.

1356
01:50:26,005 --> 01:50:33,038
And the wound in his back began to painGregor all over again, when now mother and

1357
01:50:33,038 --> 01:50:40,055
sister, after they had escorted the fatherto bed, came back, let their work lie,

1358
01:50:40,055 --> 01:50:43,027
moved close together, and sat cheek to

1359
01:50:43,027 --> 01:50:49,096
cheek and when his mother would now say,pointing to Gregor's room, "Close the door,

1360
01:50:49,096 --> 01:50:56,007
Grete," and when Gregor was again in thedarkness, while close by the women mingled

1361
01:50:56,007 --> 01:51:03,095
their tears or, quite dry eyed, stared atthe table.

1362
01:51:03,095 --> 01:51:09,002
Gregor spent his nights and days withhardly any sleep.

1363
01:51:09,002 --> 01:51:12,067
Sometimes he thought that the next time thedoor opened he would take over the family

1364
01:51:12,067 --> 01:51:16,002
arrangements just as he had earlier.

1365
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:22,064
In his imagination appeared again, after along time, his employer and supervisor and

1366
01:51:22,064 --> 01:51:29,051
the apprentices, the excessively spinelesscustodian, two or three friends from other

1367
01:51:29,051 --> 01:51:32,075
businesses, a chambermaid from a hotel in

1368
01:51:32,075 --> 01:51:40,033
the provinces, a loving fleeting memory, afemale cashier from a hat shop, whom he had

1369
01:51:40,033 --> 01:51:47,003
seriously but too slowly courted--they allappeared mixed in with strangers or people

1370
01:51:47,003 --> 01:51:49,008
he had already forgotten, but instead of

1371
01:51:49,008 --> 01:51:55,067
helping him and his family, they were allunapproachable, and he was happy to see

1372
01:51:55,067 --> 01:52:01,048
them disappear.But then he was in no mood to worry about

1373
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:02,081
his family.

1374
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:08,051
He was filled with sheer anger over thewretched care he was getting, even though

1375
01:52:08,051 --> 01:52:13,045
he couldn't imagine anything which he mighthave an appetite for.

1376
01:52:13,045 --> 01:52:18,065
Still, he made plans about how he couldtake from the larder what he at all account

1377
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:22,067
deserved, even if he wasn't hungry.

1378
01:52:22,067 --> 01:52:26,054
Without thinking any more about how theymight be able to give Gregor special

1379
01:52:26,054 --> 01:52:32,075
pleasure, the sister now kicked some foodor other very quickly into his room in the

1380
01:52:32,075 --> 01:52:35,068
morning and at noon, before she ran off to

1381
01:52:35,068 --> 01:52:40,034
her shop, and in the evening, quiteindifferent to whether the food had perhaps

1382
01:52:40,034 --> 01:52:47,003
only been tasted or, what happened mostfrequently, remained entirely undisturbed,

1383
01:52:47,003 --> 01:52:51,036
she whisked it out with one sweep of herbroom.

1384
01:52:51,036 --> 01:52:56,489
The task of cleaning his room, which shenow always carried out in the evening,

1385
01:52:56,489 --> 01:53:00,005
could not be done any more quickly.

1386
01:53:00,005 --> 01:53:06,027
Streaks of dirt ran along the walls; hereand there lay tangles of dust and garbage.

1387
01:53:06,027 --> 01:53:12,038
At first, when his sister arrived, Gregorpositioned himself in a particularly filthy

1388
01:53:12,038 --> 01:53:18,007
corner in order with this posture to makesomething of a protest.

1389
01:53:18,007 --> 01:53:22,018
But he could have well stayed there forweeks without his sister's changing her

1390
01:53:22,018 --> 01:53:24,001
ways.

1391
01:53:24,001 --> 01:53:30,065
In fact, she perceived the dirt as much ashe did, but she had decided just to let it

1392
01:53:30,065 --> 01:53:33,061
stay.

1393
01:53:33,061 --> 01:53:38,088
In this business, with a touchiness whichwas quite new to her and which had

1394
01:53:38,088 --> 01:53:44,055
generally taken over the entire family, shekept watch to see that the cleaning of

1395
01:53:44,055 --> 01:53:49,000
Gregor's room remained reserved for her.

1396
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,008
Once his mother had undertaken a majorcleaning of Gregor's room, which she had

1397
01:53:53,008 --> 01:53:58,006
only completed successfully after using afew buckets of water.

1398
01:53:58,006 --> 01:54:06,013
But the extensive dampness made Gregor sickand he lay supine, embittered and immobile

1399
01:54:06,013 --> 01:54:10,055
on the couch.However, the mother's punishment was not

1400
01:54:10,055 --> 01:54:11,097
delayed for long.

1401
01:54:11,097 --> 01:54:16,008
For in the evening the sister had hardlyobserved the change in Gregor's room before

1402
01:54:16,008 --> 01:54:22,011
she ran into the living room mightilyoffended and, in spite of her mother's hand

1403
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:26,018
lifted high in entreaty, broke out in a fitof crying.

1404
01:54:26,018 --> 01:54:33,036
Her parents--the father had, of course,woken up with a start in his arm chair--at

1405
01:54:33,036 --> 01:54:37,007
first looked at her astonished andhelpless, until they started to get

1406
01:54:37,007 --> 01:54:39,042
agitated.

1407
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:44,059
Turning to his right, the father heapedreproaches on the mother that she was not

1408
01:54:44,059 --> 01:54:49,082
to take over the cleaning of Gregor's roomfrom the sister and, turning to his left,

1409
01:54:49,082 --> 01:54:52,069
he shouted at the sister that she would no

1410
01:54:52,069 --> 01:54:58,005
longer be allowed to clean Gregor's roomever again, while the mother tried to pull

1411
01:54:58,005 --> 01:55:03,086
the father, beside himself in hisexcitement, into the bed room.

1412
01:55:03,086 --> 01:55:10,061
The sister, shaken by her crying fit,pounded on the table with her tiny fists,

1413
01:55:10,061 --> 01:55:16,989
and Gregor hissed at all this, angry thatno one thought about shutting the door and

1414
01:55:16,989 --> 01:55:21,053
sparing him the sight of this commotion.

1415
01:55:21,053 --> 01:55:27,016
But even when the sister, exhausted fromher daily work, had grown tired of caring

1416
01:55:27,016 --> 01:55:34,037
for Gregor as she had before, even then themother did not have to come at all on her

1417
01:55:34,037 --> 01:55:34,093
behalf.

1418
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:41,007
And Gregor did not have to be neglected.For now the cleaning woman was there.

1419
01:55:41,007 --> 01:55:46,085
This old widow, who in her long life musthave managed to survive the worst with the

1420
01:55:46,085 --> 01:55:52,057
help of her bony frame, had no real horrorof Gregor.

1421
01:55:52,057 --> 01:55:57,028
Without being in the least curious, she hadonce by chance opened Gregor's door.

1422
01:55:57,028 --> 01:56:03,048
At the sight of Gregor, who, totallysurprised, began to scamper here and there,

1423
01:56:03,048 --> 01:56:08,023
although no one was chasing him, sheremained standing with her hands folded

1424
01:56:08,023 --> 01:56:11,068
across her stomach staring at him.

1425
01:56:11,068 --> 01:56:16,083
Since then she did not fail to open thedoor furtively a little every morning and

1426
01:56:16,083 --> 01:56:18,045
evening to look in on Gregor.

1427
01:56:18,045 --> 01:56:25,005
At first, she also called him to her withwords which she presumably thought were

1428
01:56:25,005 --> 01:56:31,051
friendly, like "Come here for a bit, olddung beetle!" or "Hey, look at the old dung

1429
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:33,075
beetle!"

1430
01:56:33,075 --> 01:56:39,003
Addressed in such a manner, Gregor answerednothing, but remained motionless in his

1431
01:56:39,003 --> 01:56:43,053
place, as if the door had not been openedat all.

1432
01:56:43,053 --> 01:56:48,059
If only, instead of allowing this cleaningwoman to disturb him uselessly whenever she

1433
01:56:48,059 --> 01:56:55,031
felt like it, they had given her orders toclean up his room every day!

1434
01:56:55,031 --> 01:57:00,091
One day in the early morning--a harddownpour, perhaps already a sign of the

1435
01:57:00,091 --> 01:57:06,092
coming spring, struck the window panes--when the cleaning woman started up once

1436
01:57:06,092 --> 01:57:09,009
again with her usual conversation, Gregor

1437
01:57:09,009 --> 01:57:16,008
was so bitter that he turned towards her,as if for an attack, although slowly and

1438
01:57:16,008 --> 01:57:17,086
weakly.

1439
01:57:17,086 --> 01:57:22,043
But instead of being afraid of him, thecleaning woman merely lifted up a chair

1440
01:57:22,043 --> 01:57:28,007
standing close by the door and, as shestood there with her mouth wide open, her

1441
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:31,044
intention was clear: she would close her

1442
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:36,003
mouth only when the chair in her hand hadbeen thrown down on Gregor's back.

1443
01:57:36,003 --> 01:57:42,063
"This goes no further, all right?" sheasked, as Gregor turned himself around

1444
01:57:42,063 --> 01:57:48,067
again, and she placed the chair calmly backin the corner.

1445
01:57:48,067 --> 01:57:52,078
Gregor ate hardly anything any more.

1446
01:57:52,078 --> 01:57:58,073
Only when he chanced to move past the foodwhich had been prepared did he, as a game,

1447
01:57:58,073 --> 01:58:04,068
take a bit into his mouth, hold it therefor hours, and generally spit it out again.

1448
01:58:04,068 --> 01:58:10,008
At first he thought it might be his sadnessover the condition of his room which kept

1449
01:58:10,008 --> 01:58:18,053
him from eating, but he very soon becamereconciled to the alterations in his room.

1450
01:58:18,053 --> 01:58:22,068
People had grown accustomed to put intostorage in his room things which they

1451
01:58:22,068 --> 01:58:28,076
couldn't put anywhere else, and at thispoint there were many such things, now that

1452
01:58:28,076 --> 01:58:32,007
they had rented one room of the apartmentto three lodgers.

1453
01:58:32,007 --> 01:58:39,097
These solemn gentlemen--all three had fullbeards, as Gregor once found out through a

1454
01:58:39,097 --> 01:58:46,048
crack in the door--were meticulously intenton tidiness, not only in their own room

1455
01:58:46,048 --> 01:58:49,097
but, since they had now rented a room here,

1456
01:58:49,097 --> 01:58:54,092
in the entire household, and particularlyin the kitchen.

1457
01:58:54,092 --> 01:59:00,076
They simply did not tolerate any useless orshoddy stuff.

1458
01:59:00,076 --> 01:59:05,003
Moreover, for the most part they hadbrought with them their own pieces of

1459
01:59:05,003 --> 01:59:06,001
furniture.

1460
01:59:06,001 --> 01:59:11,007
Thus, many items had become superfluous,and these were not really things one could

1461
01:59:11,007 --> 01:59:15,071
sell or things people wanted to throw out.

1462
01:59:15,071 --> 01:59:22,008
All these items ended up in Gregor's room,even the box of ashes and the garbage pail

1463
01:59:22,008 --> 01:59:24,026
from the kitchen.

1464
01:59:24,026 --> 01:59:29,047
The cleaning woman, always in a hurry,simply flung anything that was momentarily

1465
01:59:29,047 --> 01:59:35,098
useless into Gregor's room.Fortunately Gregor generally saw only the

1466
01:59:35,098 --> 01:59:39,089
relevant object and the hand which held it.

1467
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:45,062
The cleaning woman perhaps was intending,when time and opportunity allowed, to take

1468
01:59:45,062 --> 01:59:51,036
the stuff out again or to throw everythingout all at once, but in fact the things

1469
01:59:51,036 --> 01:59:53,088
remained lying there, wherever they had

1470
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:59,051
ended up at the first throw, unless Gregorsquirmed his way through the accumulation

1471
01:59:59,051 --> 02:00:01,081
of junk and moved it.

1472
02:00:01,081 --> 02:00:07,028
At first he was forced to do this becauseotherwise there was no room for him to

1473
02:00:07,028 --> 02:00:13,055
creep around, but later he did it with agrowing pleasure, although after such

1474
02:00:13,055 --> 02:00:21,056
movements, tired to death and feelingwretched, he didn't budge for hours.

1475
02:00:21,056 --> 02:00:25,067
Because the lodgers sometimes also tooktheir evening meal at home in the common

1476
02:00:25,067 --> 02:00:31,489
living room, the door to the living roomstayed shut on many evenings.

1477
02:00:31,489 --> 02:00:36,041
But Gregor had no trouble at all goingwithout the open door.

1478
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:41,076
Already on many evenings when it was openhe had not availed himself of it, but,

1479
02:00:41,076 --> 02:00:48,009
without the family noticing, was stretchedout in the darkest corner of his room.

1480
02:00:48,009 --> 02:00:53,489
However, once the cleaning woman had leftthe door to the living room slightly ajar,

1481
02:00:53,489 --> 02:00:58,033
and it remained open even when the lodgerscame in in the evening and the lights were

1482
02:00:58,033 --> 02:01:00,003
put on.

1483
02:01:00,003 --> 02:01:04,038
They sat down at the head of the table,where in earlier days the mother, the

1484
02:01:04,038 --> 02:01:09,026
father, and Gregor had eaten, unfoldedtheir serviettes, and picked up their

1485
02:01:09,026 --> 02:01:12,489
knives and forks.

1486
02:01:12,489 --> 02:01:17,009
The mother immediately appeared in the doorwith a dish of meat and right behind her

1487
02:01:17,009 --> 02:01:21,034
the sister with a dish piled high withpotatoes.

1488
02:01:21,034 --> 02:01:24,034
The food gave off a lot of steam.

1489
02:01:24,034 --> 02:01:29,022
The gentlemen lodgers bent over the plateset before them, as if they wanted to check

1490
02:01:29,022 --> 02:01:34,072
it before eating, and in fact the one whosat in the middle--for the other two he

1491
02:01:34,072 --> 02:01:38,005
seemed to serve as the authority--cut off a

1492
02:01:38,005 --> 02:01:42,047
piece of meat still on the plate obviouslyto establish whether it was sufficiently

1493
02:01:42,047 --> 02:01:47,036
tender and whether or not something shouldbe shipped back to the kitchen.

1494
02:01:47,036 --> 02:01:53,001
He was satisfied, and mother and sister,who had looked on in suspense, began to

1495
02:01:53,001 --> 02:02:00,038
breathe easily and to smile.The family itself ate in the kitchen.

1496
02:02:00,038 --> 02:02:06,018
In spite of that, before the father wentinto the kitchen, he came into the room and

1497
02:02:06,018 --> 02:02:11,019
with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tourof the table.

1498
02:02:11,019 --> 02:02:16,038
The lodgers rose up collectively andmurmured something in their beards.

1499
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:21,008
Then, when they were alone, they ate almostin complete silence.

1500
02:02:21,008 --> 02:02:27,037
It seemed odd to Gregor that, out of allthe many different sorts of sounds of

1501
02:02:27,037 --> 02:02:33,067
eating, what was always audible was theirchewing teeth, as if by that Gregor should

1502
02:02:33,067 --> 02:02:35,094
be shown that people needed their teeth to

1503
02:02:35,094 --> 02:02:41,046
eat and that nothing could be done evenwith the most handsome toothless jawbone.

1504
02:02:41,046 --> 02:02:49,092
"I really do have an appetite," Gregor saidto himself sorrowfully, "but not for these

1505
02:02:49,092 --> 02:02:51,034
things.

1506
02:02:51,034 --> 02:02:58,005
How these lodgers stuff themselves, and Iam dying."

1507
02:02:58,005 --> 02:03:04,061
On this very evening the violin soundedfrom the kitchen.

1508
02:03:04,061 --> 02:03:09,016
Gregor didn't remember hearing it allthrough this period.

1509
02:03:09,016 --> 02:03:13,053
The lodgers had already ended their nightmeal, the middle one had pulled out a

1510
02:03:13,053 --> 02:03:18,086
newspaper and had given each of the othertwo a page, and they were now leaning back,

1511
02:03:18,086 --> 02:03:21,079
reading and smoking.

1512
02:03:21,079 --> 02:03:26,088
When the violin started playing, theybecame attentive, got up, and went on

1513
02:03:26,088 --> 02:03:31,098
tiptoe to the hall door, at which theyremained standing pressed up against one

1514
02:03:31,098 --> 02:03:32,034
another.

1515
02:03:32,034 --> 02:03:37,989
They must have been audible from thekitchen, because the father called out

1516
02:03:37,989 --> 02:03:40,489
"Perhaps the gentlemen don't like theplaying?

1517
02:03:40,489 --> 02:03:42,092
It can be stopped at once."

1518
02:03:42,092 --> 02:03:47,091
"On the contrary," stated the lodger in themiddle, "might the young woman not come

1519
02:03:47,091 --> 02:03:51,048
into us and play in the room here, where itis really much more comfortable and

1520
02:03:51,048 --> 02:03:51,096
cheerful?"

1521
02:03:51,096 --> 02:03:59,489
"Oh, thank you," cried out the father, asif he were the one playing the violin.

1522
02:03:59,489 --> 02:04:02,989
The men stepped back into the room andwaited.

1523
02:04:02,989 --> 02:04:08,969
Soon the father came with the music stand,the mother with the sheet music, and the

1524
02:04:08,969 --> 02:04:13,739
sister with the violin.The sister calmly prepared everything for

1525
02:04:13,739 --> 02:04:15,063
the recital.

1526
02:04:15,063 --> 02:04:20,489
The parents, who had never previouslyrented a room and therefore exaggerated

1527
02:04:20,489 --> 02:04:25,095
their politeness to the lodgers, dared notsit on their own chairs.

1528
02:04:25,095 --> 02:04:30,007
The father leaned against the door, hisright hand stuck between two buttons of his

1529
02:04:30,007 --> 02:04:35,018
buttoned-up uniform.The mother, however, accepted a chair

1530
02:04:35,018 --> 02:04:38,013
offered by one lodger.

1531
02:04:38,013 --> 02:04:42,039
Since she left the chair sit where thegentleman had chanced to put it, she sat to

1532
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:49,239
one side in a corner.The sister began to play.

1533
02:04:49,239 --> 02:04:54,038
The father and mother, one on each side,followed attentively the movements of her

1534
02:04:54,038 --> 02:04:56,007
hands.

1535
02:04:56,007 --> 02:05:00,087
Attracted by the playing, Gregor hadventured to advance a little further

1536
02:05:00,087 --> 02:05:04,093
forward and his head was already in theliving room.

1537
02:05:04,093 --> 02:05:10,026
He scarcely wondered about the fact thatrecently he had had so little consideration

1538
02:05:10,026 --> 02:05:13,091
for the others.Earlier this consideration had been

1539
02:05:13,091 --> 02:05:15,084
something he was proud of.

1540
02:05:15,084 --> 02:05:21,007
And for that very reason he would have hadat this moment more reason to hide away,

1541
02:05:21,007 --> 02:05:27,002
because as a result of the dust which layall over his room and flew around with the

1542
02:05:27,002 --> 02:05:31,043
slightest movement, he was totally coveredin dirt.

1543
02:05:31,043 --> 02:05:38,045
On his back and his sides he carted aroundwith him dust, threads, hair, and remnants

1544
02:05:38,045 --> 02:05:40,219
of food.

1545
02:05:40,219 --> 02:05:45,469
His indifference to everything was much toogreat for him to lie on his back and scour

1546
02:05:45,469 --> 02:05:51,036
himself on the carpet, as he often had doneearlier during the day.

1547
02:05:51,036 --> 02:05:57,028
In spite of his condition he had notimidity about inching forward a bit on the

1548
02:05:57,028 --> 02:06:04,011
spotless floor of the living room.In any case, no one paid him any attention.

1549
02:06:04,011 --> 02:06:07,051
The family was all caught up in the violinplaying.

1550
02:06:07,051 --> 02:06:12,086
The lodgers, by contrast, who for themoment had placed themselves, hands in

1551
02:06:12,086 --> 02:06:19,005
their trouser pockets, behind the musicstand much too close to the sister, so that

1552
02:06:19,005 --> 02:06:21,034
they could all see the sheet music,

1553
02:06:21,034 --> 02:06:26,045
something that must certainly bother thesister, soon drew back to the window

1554
02:06:26,045 --> 02:06:31,989
conversing in low voices with bowed heads,where they then remained, worriedly

1555
02:06:31,989 --> 02:06:35,002
observed by the father.

1556
02:06:35,002 --> 02:06:39,068
It now seemed really clear that, havingassumed they were to hear a beautiful or

1557
02:06:39,068 --> 02:06:45,038
entertaining violin recital, they weredisappointed and were allowing their peace

1558
02:06:45,038 --> 02:06:50,719
and quiet to be disturbed only out ofpoliteness.

1559
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:54,088
The way in which they all blew the smokefrom their cigars out of their noses and

1560
02:06:54,088 --> 02:07:01,034
mouths in particular led one to concludethat they were very irritated.

1561
02:07:01,034 --> 02:07:04,084
And yet his sister was playing sobeautifully.

1562
02:07:04,084 --> 02:07:12,026
Her face was turned to the side, her gazefollowed the score intently and sadly.

1563
02:07:12,026 --> 02:07:17,059
Gregor crept forward still a littlefurther, keeping his head close against the

1564
02:07:17,059 --> 02:07:23,003
floor in order to be able to catch her gazeif possible.

1565
02:07:23,003 --> 02:07:26,095
Was he an animal that music so captivatedhim?

1566
02:07:26,095 --> 02:07:33,007
For him it was as if the way to the unknownnourishment he craved was revealing itself.

1567
02:07:33,007 --> 02:07:39,091
He was determined to press forward right tohis sister, to tug at her dress, and to

1568
02:07:39,091 --> 02:07:46,003
indicate to her in this way that she mightstill come with her violin into his room,

1569
02:07:46,003 --> 02:07:52,015
because here no one valued the recital ashe wanted to value it.

1570
02:07:52,015 --> 02:07:59,002
He did not wish to let her go from his roomany more, at least not as long as he lived.

1571
02:07:59,002 --> 02:08:04,013
His frightening appearance would for thefirst time become useful for him.

1572
02:08:04,013 --> 02:08:09,091
He wanted to be at all the doors of hisroom simultaneously and snarl back at the

1573
02:08:09,091 --> 02:08:12,018
attackers.

1574
02:08:12,018 --> 02:08:17,057
However, his sister should not be compelledbut would remain with him voluntarily.

1575
02:08:17,057 --> 02:08:23,014
She would sit next to him on the sofa, benddown her ear to him, and he would then

1576
02:08:23,014 --> 02:08:30,026
confide in her that he firmly intended tosend her to the conservatory and that, if

1577
02:08:30,026 --> 02:08:32,055
his misfortune had not arrived in the

1578
02:08:32,055 --> 02:08:38,001
interim, he would have declared all thislast Christmas--had Christmas really

1579
02:08:38,001 --> 02:08:42,033
already come and gone?--and would havebrooked no argument.

1580
02:08:42,033 --> 02:08:49,013
After this explanation his sister wouldbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor

1581
02:08:49,013 --> 02:08:55,003
would lift himself up to her armpit andkiss her throat, which she, from the time

1582
02:08:55,003 --> 02:09:02,055
she started going to work, had left exposedwithout a band or a collar.

1583
02:09:02,055 --> 02:09:07,078
"Mr. Samsa," called out the middle lodgerto the father and, without uttering a

1584
02:09:07,078 --> 02:09:14,089
further word, pointed his index finger atGregor as he was moving slowly forward.

1585
02:09:14,089 --> 02:09:17,003
The violin fell silent.

1586
02:09:17,003 --> 02:09:23,002
The middle lodger smiled, first shaking hishead once at his friends, and then looked

1587
02:09:23,002 --> 02:09:26,027
down at Gregor once more.

1588
02:09:26,027 --> 02:09:31,002
Rather than driving Gregor back again, thefather seemed to consider it of prime

1589
02:09:31,002 --> 02:09:36,048
importance to calm down the lodgers,although they were not at all upset and

1590
02:09:36,048 --> 02:09:41,036
Gregor seemed to entertain them more thanthe violin recital.

1591
02:09:41,036 --> 02:09:45,969
The father hurried over to them and withoutstretched arms tried to push them into

1592
02:09:45,969 --> 02:09:52,003
their own room and simultaneously to blocktheir view of Gregor with his own body.

1593
02:09:52,003 --> 02:09:57,005
At this point they became really somewhatirritated, although one no longer knew

1594
02:09:57,005 --> 02:10:01,036
whether that was because of the father'sbehaviour or because of knowledge they had

1595
02:10:01,036 --> 02:10:07,068
just acquired that they had, withoutknowing it, a neighbour like Gregor.

1596
02:10:07,068 --> 02:10:12,076
They demanded explanations from his father,raised their arms to make their points,

1597
02:10:12,076 --> 02:10:19,489
tugged agitatedly at their beards, andmoved back towards their room quite slowly.

1598
02:10:19,489 --> 02:10:24,063
In the meantime, the isolation which hadsuddenly fallen upon his sister after the

1599
02:10:24,063 --> 02:10:29,007
sudden breaking off of the recital hadoverwhelmed her.

1600
02:10:29,007 --> 02:10:34,053
She had held onto the violin and bow in herlimp hands for a little while and had

1601
02:10:34,053 --> 02:10:39,011
continued to look at the sheet music as ifshe was still playing.

1602
02:10:39,011 --> 02:10:44,041
All at once she pulled herself together,placed the instrument in her mother's lap--

1603
02:10:44,041 --> 02:10:48,082
the mother was still sitting in her chairhaving trouble breathing for her lungs were

1604
02:10:48,082 --> 02:10:52,061
labouring--and had run into the next room,

1605
02:10:52,061 --> 02:10:58,989
which the lodgers, pressured by the father,were already approaching more rapidly.

1606
02:10:58,989 --> 02:11:04,003
One could observe how under the sister'spracticed hands the sheets and pillows on

1607
02:11:04,003 --> 02:11:07,084
the beds were thrown on high and arranged.

1608
02:11:07,084 --> 02:11:13,001
Even before the lodgers had reached theroom, she was finished fixing the beds and

1609
02:11:13,001 --> 02:11:15,018
was slipping out.

1610
02:11:15,018 --> 02:11:19,094
The father seemed so gripped once againwith his stubbornness that he forgot about

1611
02:11:19,094 --> 02:11:23,048
the respect which he always owed to hisrenters.

1612
02:11:23,048 --> 02:11:28,001
He pressed on and on, until at the door ofthe room the middle gentleman stamped

1613
02:11:28,001 --> 02:11:32,011
loudly with his foot and thus brought thefather to a standstill.

1614
02:11:32,011 --> 02:11:37,038
"I hereby declare," the middle lodger said,raising his hand and casting his glance

1615
02:11:37,038 --> 02:11:42,005
both on the mother and the sister, "thatconsidering the disgraceful conditions

1616
02:11:42,005 --> 02:11:45,018
prevailing in this apartment and family"--

1617
02:11:45,018 --> 02:11:51,239
with this he spat decisively on the floor--"I immediately cancel my room.

1618
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:55,069
I will, of course, pay nothing at all forthe days which I have lived here; on the

1619
02:11:55,069 --> 02:12:00,041
contrary I shall think about whether or notI will initiate some sort of action against

1620
02:12:00,041 --> 02:12:06,006
you, something which--believe me--will bevery easy to establish."

1621
02:12:06,006 --> 02:12:12,719
He fell silent and looked directly in frontof him, as if he was waiting for something.

1622
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:17,081
In fact, his two friends immediately joinedin with their opinions, "We also give

1623
02:12:17,081 --> 02:12:23,044
immediate notice."At that he seized the door handle, banged

1624
02:12:23,044 --> 02:12:27,026
the door shut, and locked it.

1625
02:12:27,026 --> 02:12:32,091
The father groped his way tottering to hischair and let himself fall in it.

1626
02:12:32,091 --> 02:12:38,044
It looked as if he was stretching out forhis usual evening snooze, but the heavy

1627
02:12:38,044 --> 02:12:44,018
nodding of his head, which looked as if itwas without support, showed that he was not

1628
02:12:44,018 --> 02:12:46,007
sleeping at all.

1629
02:12:46,007 --> 02:12:51,025
Gregor had lain motionless the entire timein the spot where the lodgers had caught

1630
02:12:51,025 --> 02:12:52,035
him.

1631
02:12:52,035 --> 02:12:57,033
Disappointment with the collapse of hisplan and perhaps also weakness brought on

1632
02:12:57,033 --> 02:13:02,008
by his severe hunger made it impossible forhim to move.

1633
02:13:02,008 --> 02:13:05,092
He was certainly afraid that a generaldisaster would break over him at any

1634
02:13:05,092 --> 02:13:09,015
moment, and he waited.

1635
02:13:09,015 --> 02:13:14,029
He was not even startled when the violinfell from the mother's lap, out from under

1636
02:13:14,029 --> 02:13:20,006
her trembling fingers, and gave off areverberating tone.

1637
02:13:20,006 --> 02:13:25,004
"My dear parents," said the sister bangingher hand on the table by way of an

1638
02:13:25,004 --> 02:13:29,969
introduction, "things cannot go on anylonger in this way.

1639
02:13:29,969 --> 02:13:33,043
Maybe if you don't understand that, well,I do.

1640
02:13:33,043 --> 02:13:37,989
I will not utter my brother's name in frontof this monster, and thus I say only that

1641
02:13:37,989 --> 02:13:40,036
we must try to get rid of it.

1642
02:13:40,036 --> 02:13:45,007
We have tried what is humanly possible totake care of it and to be patient.

1643
02:13:45,007 --> 02:13:49,045
I believe that no one can criticize us inthe slightest."

1644
02:13:49,045 --> 02:13:54,059
"She is right in a thousand ways," said thefather to himself.

1645
02:13:54,059 --> 02:13:59,008
The mother, who was still incapable ofbreathing properly, began to cough numbly

1646
02:13:59,008 --> 02:14:06,719
with her hand held up over her mouth and amanic expression in her eyes.

1647
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:10,079
The sister hurried over to her mother andheld her forehead.

1648
02:14:10,079 --> 02:14:15,055
The sister's words seemed to have led thefather to certain reflections.

1649
02:14:15,055 --> 02:14:21,048
He sat upright, played with his uniform hatamong the plates, which still lay on the

1650
02:14:21,048 --> 02:14:26,039
table from the lodgers' evening meal, andlooked now and then at the motionless

1651
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:26,091
Gregor.

1652
02:14:26,091 --> 02:14:34,239
"We must try to get rid of it," the sisternow said decisively to the father, for the

1653
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:37,239
mother, in her coughing fit, was notlistening to anything.

1654
02:14:37,239 --> 02:14:39,066
"It is killing you both.

1655
02:14:39,066 --> 02:14:43,002
I see it coming.When people have to work as hard as we all

1656
02:14:43,002 --> 02:14:48,219
do, they cannot also tolerate this endlesstorment at home.

1657
02:14:48,219 --> 02:14:50,091
I just can't go on any more."

1658
02:14:50,091 --> 02:14:57,034
And she broke out into such a crying fitthat her tears flowed out down onto her

1659
02:14:57,034 --> 02:15:00,969
mother's face.She wiped them off her mother with

1660
02:15:00,969 --> 02:15:04,088
mechanical motions of her hands.

1661
02:15:04,088 --> 02:15:09,989
"Child," said the father sympatheticallyand with obvious appreciation, "then what

1662
02:15:09,989 --> 02:15:12,007
should we do?"

1663
02:15:12,007 --> 02:15:17,033
The sister only shrugged her shoulders as asign of the perplexity which, in contrast

1664
02:15:17,033 --> 02:15:23,001
to her previous confidence, had come overher while she was crying.

1665
02:15:23,001 --> 02:15:29,027
"If only he understood us," said the fatherin a semi-questioning tone.

1666
02:15:29,027 --> 02:15:34,029
The sister, in the midst of her sobbing,shook her hand energetically as a sign that

1667
02:15:34,029 --> 02:15:37,026
there was no point thinking of that.

1668
02:15:37,026 --> 02:15:42,053
"If he only understood us," repeated thefather and by shutting his eyes he absorbed

1669
02:15:42,053 --> 02:15:47,006
the sister's conviction of theimpossibility of this point, "then perhaps

1670
02:15:47,006 --> 02:15:49,989
some compromise would be possible with him.

1671
02:15:49,989 --> 02:15:50,088
But as it is..

1672
02:15:50,088 --> 02:15:54,219
.""It must be gotten rid of," cried the

1673
02:15:54,219 --> 02:15:54,073
sister.

1674
02:15:54,073 --> 02:15:58,076
"That is the only way, father.You must try to get rid of the idea that

1675
02:15:58,076 --> 02:16:03,003
this is Gregor.The fact that we have believed for so long,

1676
02:16:03,003 --> 02:16:05,084
that is truly our real misfortune.

1677
02:16:05,084 --> 02:16:10,044
But how can it be Gregor?If it were Gregor, he would have long ago

1678
02:16:10,044 --> 02:16:16,051
realized that a communal life among humanbeings is not possible with such an animal

1679
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:19,036
and would have gone away voluntarily.

1680
02:16:19,036 --> 02:16:25,079
Then we would not have a brother, but wecould go on living and honour his memory.

1681
02:16:25,079 --> 02:16:27,719
But this animal plagues us.

1682
02:16:27,719 --> 02:16:33,439
It drives away the lodgers, will obviouslytake over the entire apartment, and leave

1683
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:39,319
us to spend the night in the alley.Just look, father," she suddenly cried out,

1684
02:16:39,319 --> 02:16:40,819
"he's already starting up again."

1685
02:16:40,819 --> 02:16:46,051
With a fright which was totallyincomprehensible to Gregor, the sister even

1686
02:16:46,051 --> 02:16:51,051
left the mother, pushed herself away fromher chair, as if she would sooner sacrifice

1687
02:16:51,051 --> 02:16:54,059
her mother than remain in Gregor's

1688
02:16:54,059 --> 02:17:00,013
vicinity, and rushed behind her father who,excited merely by her behaviour, also stood

1689
02:17:00,013 --> 02:17:05,279
up and half raised his arms in front of thesister as though to protect her.

1690
02:17:05,279 --> 02:17:11,063
But Gregor did not have any notion ofwishing to create problems for anyone and

1691
02:17:11,063 --> 02:17:14,489
certainly not for his sister.

1692
02:17:14,489 --> 02:17:20,349
He had just started to turn himself aroundin order to creep back into his room, quite

1693
02:17:20,349 --> 02:17:26,069
a startling sight, since, as a result ofhis suffering condition, he had to guide

1694
02:17:26,069 --> 02:17:28,008
himself through the difficulty of turning

1695
02:17:28,008 --> 02:17:34,309
around with his head, in this processlifting and banging it against the floor

1696
02:17:34,309 --> 02:17:38,779
several times.He paused and looked around.

1697
02:17:38,779 --> 02:17:43,001
His good intentions seem to have beenrecognized.

1698
02:17:43,001 --> 02:17:48,034
The fright had lasted only for a moment.Now they looked at him in silence and

1699
02:17:48,034 --> 02:17:50,109
sorrow.

1700
02:17:50,109 --> 02:17:55,084
His mother lay in her chair, with her legsstretched out and pressed together; her

1701
02:17:55,084 --> 02:18:01,459
eyes were almost shut from weariness.The father and sister sat next to one

1702
02:18:01,459 --> 02:18:02,076
another.

1703
02:18:02,076 --> 02:18:07,359
The sister had set her hands around thefather's neck.

1704
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:13,359
"Now perhaps I can actually turn myselfaround," thought Gregor and began the task

1705
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:14,769
again.

1706
02:18:14,769 --> 02:18:21,042
He couldn't stop puffing at the effort andhad to rest now and then.

1707
02:18:21,042 --> 02:18:27,079
Besides, no one was urging him on.It was all left to him on his own.

1708
02:18:27,079 --> 02:18:32,979
When he had completed turning around, heimmediately began to wander straight back.

1709
02:18:32,979 --> 02:18:37,869
He was astonished at the great distancewhich separated him from his room and did

1710
02:18:37,869 --> 02:18:42,209
not understand in the least how in hisweakness he had covered the same distance a

1711
02:18:42,209 --> 02:18:47,739
short time before, almost without noticingit.

1712
02:18:47,739 --> 02:18:52,689
Constantly intent only on creeping alongquickly, he hardly paid any attention to

1713
02:18:52,689 --> 02:18:58,209
the fact that no word or cry from hisfamily interrupted him.

1714
02:18:58,209 --> 02:19:03,829
Only when he was already in the door did heturn his head, not completely, because he

1715
02:19:03,829 --> 02:19:08,749
felt his neck growing stiff.At any rate he still saw that behind him

1716
02:19:08,749 --> 02:19:11,069
nothing had changed.

1717
02:19:11,069 --> 02:19:16,359
Only the sister was standing up.His last glimpse brushed over the mother

1718
02:19:16,359 --> 02:19:17,979
who was now completely asleep.

1719
02:19:17,979 --> 02:19:25,359
Hardly was he inside his room when the doorwas pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast,

1720
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,849
and barred.

1721
02:19:27,849 --> 02:19:32,819
Gregor was startled by the sudden commotionbehind him, so much so that his little

1722
02:19:32,819 --> 02:19:37,092
limbs bent double under him.It was his sister who had been in such a

1723
02:19:37,092 --> 02:19:38,679
hurry.

1724
02:19:38,679 --> 02:19:45,469
She had stood up right away, had waited,and had then sprung forward nimbly.

1725
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:48,489
Gregor had not heard anything of herapproach.

1726
02:19:48,489 --> 02:19:55,959
She cried out "Finally!" to her parents, asshe turned the key in the lock.

1727
02:19:55,959 --> 02:20:00,031
"What now?"Gregor asked himself and looked around him

1728
02:20:00,031 --> 02:20:02,009
in the darkness.

1729
02:20:02,009 --> 02:20:06,089
He soon made the discovery that he could nolonger move at all.

1730
02:20:06,089 --> 02:20:09,409
He was not surprised at that.

1731
02:20:09,409 --> 02:20:14,369
On the contrary, it struck him as unnaturalthat up to this point he had really been

1732
02:20:14,369 --> 02:20:18,059
able up to move around with these thinlittle legs.

1733
02:20:18,059 --> 02:20:21,229
Besides he felt relatively content.

1734
02:20:21,229 --> 02:20:27,319
True, he had pains throughout his entirebody, but it seemed to him that they were

1735
02:20:27,319 --> 02:20:33,399
gradually becoming weaker and weaker andwould finally go away completely.

1736
02:20:33,399 --> 02:20:39,119
The rotten apple in his back and theinflamed surrounding area, entirely covered

1737
02:20:39,119 --> 02:20:45,399
with white dust, he hardly noticed.He remembered his family with deep feelings

1738
02:20:45,399 --> 02:20:47,279
of love.

1739
02:20:47,279 --> 02:20:53,319
In this business, his own thought that hehad to disappear was, if possible, even

1740
02:20:53,319 --> 02:20:56,649
more decisive than his sister's.

1741
02:20:56,649 --> 02:21:02,014
He remained in this state of empty andpeaceful reflection until the tower clock

1742
02:21:02,014 --> 02:21:06,949
struck three o'clock in the morning.From the window he witnessed the beginning

1743
02:21:06,949 --> 02:21:09,008
of the general dawning outside.

1744
02:21:09,008 --> 02:21:16,189
Then without willing it, his head sank allthe way down, and from his nostrils flowed

1745
02:21:16,189 --> 02:21:22,909
out weakly his last breath.Early in the morning the cleaning woman

1746
02:21:22,909 --> 02:21:23,092
came.

1747
02:21:23,092 --> 02:21:30,059
In her sheer energy and haste she bangedall the doors--in precisely the way people

1748
02:21:30,059 --> 02:21:36,006
had already asked her to avoid--so much sothat once she arrived a quiet sleep was no

1749
02:21:36,006 --> 02:21:40,989
longer possible anywhere in the entireapartment.

1750
02:21:40,989 --> 02:21:47,239
In her customarily brief visit to Gregorshe at first found nothing special.

1751
02:21:47,239 --> 02:21:51,034
She thought he lay so immobile therebecause he wanted to play the offended

1752
02:21:51,034 --> 02:21:55,063
party.She gave him credit for as complete an

1753
02:21:55,063 --> 02:21:58,059
understanding as possible.

1754
02:21:58,059 --> 02:22:02,097
Since she happened to be holding the longbroom in her hand, she tried to tickle

1755
02:22:02,097 --> 02:22:04,409
Gregor with it from the door.

1756
02:22:04,409 --> 02:22:12,149
When that was quite unsuccessful, shebecame irritated and poked Gregor a little,

1757
02:22:12,149 --> 02:22:16,979
and only when she had shoved him from hisplace without any resistance did she become

1758
02:22:16,979 --> 02:22:19,159
attentive.

1759
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:25,859
When she quickly realized the true state ofaffairs, her eyes grew large, she whistled

1760
02:22:25,859 --> 02:22:30,055
to herself.However, she didn't restrain herself for

1761
02:22:30,055 --> 02:22:31,739
long.

1762
02:22:31,739 --> 02:22:36,949
She pulled open the door of the bedroom andyelled in a loud voice into the darkness,

1763
02:22:36,949 --> 02:22:39,529
"Come and look.It's kicked the bucket.

1764
02:22:39,529 --> 02:22:43,009
It's lying there, totally snuffed!"

1765
02:22:43,009 --> 02:22:48,109
The Samsa married couple sat upright intheir marriage bed and had to get over

1766
02:22:48,109 --> 02:22:52,209
their fright at the cleaning woman beforethey managed to grasp her message.

1767
02:22:52,209 --> 02:23:00,749
But then Mr. and Mrs. Samsa climbed veryquickly out of bed, one on either side.

1768
02:23:00,749 --> 02:23:06,006
Mr. Samsa threw the bedspread over hisshoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her

1769
02:23:06,006 --> 02:23:11,077
night-shirt, and like this they steppedinto Gregor's room.

1770
02:23:11,077 --> 02:23:15,097
Meanwhile, the door of the living room, inwhich Grete had slept since the lodgers had

1771
02:23:15,097 --> 02:23:19,499
arrived on the scene, had also opened.

1772
02:23:19,499 --> 02:23:25,939
She was fully clothed, as if she had notslept at all; her white face also seem to

1773
02:23:25,939 --> 02:23:26,569
indicate that.

1774
02:23:26,569 --> 02:23:33,579
"Dead?" said Mrs. Samsa and lookedquestioningly at the cleaning woman,

1775
02:23:33,579 --> 02:23:38,529
although she could check everything on herown and even understand without a check.

1776
02:23:38,529 --> 02:23:44,052
"I should say so," said the cleaning womanand, by way of proof, poked Gregor's body

1777
02:23:44,052 --> 02:23:48,689
with the broom a considerable distance moreto the side.

1778
02:23:48,689 --> 02:23:55,399
Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wishedto restrain the broom, but didn't do it.

1779
02:23:55,399 --> 02:23:59,069
"Well," said Mr. Samsa, "now we can givethanks to God."

1780
02:23:59,069 --> 02:24:05,064
He crossed himself, and the three womenfollowed his example.

1781
02:24:05,064 --> 02:24:11,909
Grete, who did not take her eyes off thecorpse, said, "Look how thin he was.

1782
02:24:11,909 --> 02:24:16,003
He had eaten nothing for such a long time.

1783
02:24:16,003 --> 02:24:19,052
The meals which came in here came out againexactly the same."

1784
02:24:19,052 --> 02:24:26,034
In fact, Gregor's body was completely flatand dry.

1785
02:24:26,034 --> 02:24:31,017
That was apparent really for the firsttime, now that he was no longer raised on

1786
02:24:31,017 --> 02:24:35,031
his small limbs and nothing else distractedone's gaze.

1787
02:24:35,031 --> 02:24:43,027
"Grete, come into us for a moment," saidMrs. Samsa with a melancholy smile, and

1788
02:24:43,027 --> 02:24:49,449
Grete went, not without looking back at thecorpse, behind her parents into the bed

1789
02:24:49,449 --> 02:24:50,979
room.

1790
02:24:50,979 --> 02:24:55,026
The cleaning woman shut the door and openedthe window wide.

1791
02:24:55,026 --> 02:25:00,819
In spite of the early morning, the freshair was partly tinged with warmth.

1792
02:25:00,819 --> 02:25:05,068
It was already the end of March.

1793
02:25:05,068 --> 02:25:10,064
The three lodgers stepped out of their roomand looked around for their breakfast,

1794
02:25:10,064 --> 02:25:13,034
astonished that they had been forgotten.

1795
02:25:13,034 --> 02:25:18,009
"Where is the breakfast?" asked the middleone of the gentlemen grumpily to the

1796
02:25:18,009 --> 02:25:19,047
cleaning woman.

1797
02:25:19,047 --> 02:25:25,489
However, she laid her finger to her lipsand then quickly and silently indicated to

1798
02:25:25,489 --> 02:25:28,829
the lodgers that they could come intoGregor's room.

1799
02:25:28,829 --> 02:25:35,079
So they came and stood in the room, whichwas already quite bright, around Gregor's

1800
02:25:35,079 --> 02:25:39,319
corpse, their hands in the pockets of theirsomewhat worn jackets.

1801
02:25:39,319 --> 02:25:46,017
Then the door of the bed room opened, andMr. Samsa appeared in his uniform, with his

1802
02:25:46,017 --> 02:25:49,199
wife on one arm and his daughter on theother.

1803
02:25:49,199 --> 02:25:52,059
All were a little tear stained.

1804
02:25:52,059 --> 02:25:57,819
Now and then Grete pressed her face ontoher father's arm.

1805
02:25:57,819 --> 02:26:03,056
"Get out of my apartment immediately," saidMr. Samsa and pulled open the door, without

1806
02:26:03,056 --> 02:26:05,399
letting go of the women.

1807
02:26:05,399 --> 02:26:12,399
"What do you mean?" said the middle lodger,somewhat dismayed and with a sugary smile.

1808
02:26:12,399 --> 02:26:17,069
The two others kept their hands behind themand constantly rubbed them against each

1809
02:26:17,069 --> 02:26:23,279
other, as if in joyful anticipation of agreat squabble which must end up in their

1810
02:26:23,279 --> 02:26:23,609
favour.

1811
02:26:23,609 --> 02:26:29,006
"I mean exactly what I say," replied Mr.Samsa and went directly with his two female

1812
02:26:29,006 --> 02:26:32,043
companions up to the lodger.

1813
02:26:32,043 --> 02:26:38,239
The latter at first stood there motionlessand looked at the floor, as if matters were

1814
02:26:38,239 --> 02:26:42,009
arranging themselves in a new way in hishead.

1815
02:26:42,009 --> 02:26:48,199
"All right, then we'll go," he said andlooked up at Mr. Samsa as if, suddenly

1816
02:26:48,199 --> 02:26:54,749
overcome by humility, he was asking freshpermission for this decision.

1817
02:26:54,749 --> 02:26:59,017
Mr. Samsa merely nodded to him repeatedlywith his eyes open wide.

1818
02:26:59,017 --> 02:27:06,289
Following that, the lodger actually wentwith long strides immediately out into the

1819
02:27:06,289 --> 02:27:07,076
hall.

1820
02:27:07,076 --> 02:27:12,949
His two friends had already been listeningfor a while with their hands quite still,

1821
02:27:12,949 --> 02:27:17,081
and now they hopped smartly after him, asif afraid that Mr. Samsa could step into

1822
02:27:17,081 --> 02:27:22,499
the hall ahead of them and disturb theirreunion with their leader.

1823
02:27:22,499 --> 02:27:27,459
In the hall all three of them took theirhats from the coat rack, pulled their canes

1824
02:27:27,459 --> 02:27:33,085
from the cane holder, bowed silently, andleft the apartment.

1825
02:27:33,085 --> 02:27:38,749
In what turned out to be an entirelygroundless mistrust, Mr. Samsa stepped with

1826
02:27:38,749 --> 02:27:44,068
the two women out onto the landing, leanedagainst the railing, and looked over as the

1827
02:27:44,068 --> 02:27:47,043
three lodgers slowly but steadily made

1828
02:27:47,043 --> 02:27:52,959
their way down the long staircase,disappeared on each floor in a certain turn

1829
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:57,055
of the stairwell, and in a few seconds cameout again.

1830
02:27:57,055 --> 02:28:03,409
The deeper they proceeded, the more theSamsa family lost interest in them, and

1831
02:28:03,409 --> 02:28:08,209
when a butcher with a tray on his head cometo meet them and then with a proud bearing

1832
02:28:08,209 --> 02:28:11,279
ascended the stairs high above them, Mr.

1833
02:28:11,279 --> 02:28:16,819
Samsa., together with the women, left thebanister, and they all returned, as if

1834
02:28:16,819 --> 02:28:24,149
relieved, back into their apartment.They decided to pass that day resting and

1835
02:28:24,149 --> 02:28:26,279
going for a stroll.

1836
02:28:26,279 --> 02:28:30,097
Not only had they earned this break fromwork, but there was no question that they

1837
02:28:30,097 --> 02:28:33,249
really needed it.

1838
02:28:33,249 --> 02:28:39,659
And so they sat down at the table and wrotethree letters of apology: Mr. Samsa to his

1839
02:28:39,659 --> 02:28:46,729
supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, andGrete to her proprietor.

1840
02:28:46,729 --> 02:28:51,409
During the writing the cleaning woman camein to say that she was going off, for her

1841
02:28:51,409 --> 02:28:55,989
morning work was finished.The three people writing at first merely

1842
02:28:55,989 --> 02:28:59,056
nodded, without glancing up.

1843
02:28:59,056 --> 02:29:03,003
Only when the cleaning woman was stillunwilling to depart, did they look up

1844
02:29:03,003 --> 02:29:08,001
angrily."Well?" asked Mr. Samsa.

1845
02:29:08,001 --> 02:29:12,779
The cleaning woman stood smiling in thedoorway, as if she had a great stroke of

1846
02:29:12,779 --> 02:29:18,709
luck to report to the family but would onlydo it if she was asked directly.

1847
02:29:18,709 --> 02:29:24,709
The almost upright small ostrich feather inher hat, which had irritated Mr. Samsa

1848
02:29:24,709 --> 02:29:30,579
during her entire service, swayed lightlyin all directions.

1849
02:29:30,579 --> 02:29:35,459
"All right then, what do you really want?"asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady

1850
02:29:35,459 --> 02:29:38,359
still usually respected.

1851
02:29:38,359 --> 02:29:42,649
"Well," answered the cleaning woman,smiling so happily she couldn't go on

1852
02:29:42,649 --> 02:29:48,006
speaking right away, "about how thatrubbish from the next room should be thrown

1853
02:29:48,006 --> 02:29:50,369
out, you mustn't worry about it.

1854
02:29:50,369 --> 02:29:55,084
It's all taken care of."Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down to their

1855
02:29:55,084 --> 02:30:00,119
letters, as though they wanted to go onwriting.

1856
02:30:00,119 --> 02:30:04,779
Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the cleaningwoman wanted to start describing everything

1857
02:30:04,779 --> 02:30:10,055
in detail, decisively prevented her with anoutstretched hand.

1858
02:30:10,055 --> 02:30:16,001
But since she was not allowed to explain,she remembered the great hurry she was in,

1859
02:30:16,001 --> 02:30:23,399
and called out, clearly insulted, "Bye bye,everyone," turned around furiously and left

1860
02:30:23,399 --> 02:30:28,619
the apartment with a fearful slamming ofthe door.

1861
02:30:28,619 --> 02:30:33,089
"This evening she'll be let go," said Mr.Samsa, but he got no answer from either his

1862
02:30:33,089 --> 02:30:39,047
wife or from his daughter, because thecleaning woman seemed to have upset once

1863
02:30:39,047 --> 02:30:41,084
again the tranquillity they had justattained.

1864
02:30:41,084 --> 02:30:48,729
They got up, went to the window, andremained there, with their arms about each

1865
02:30:48,729 --> 02:30:49,899
other.

1866
02:30:49,899 --> 02:30:56,079
Mr. Samsa turned around in his chair intheir direction and observed them quietly

1867
02:30:56,079 --> 02:31:00,006
for a while.Then he called out, "All right, come here

1868
02:31:00,006 --> 02:31:01,279
then.

1869
02:31:01,279 --> 02:31:07,329
Let's finally get rid of old things.And have a little consideration for me."

1870
02:31:07,329 --> 02:31:12,002
The women attended to him at once.They rushed to him, caressed him, and

1871
02:31:12,002 --> 02:31:15,085
quickly ended their letters.

1872
02:31:15,085 --> 02:31:21,279
Then all three left the apartment together,something they had not done for months now,

1873
02:31:21,279 --> 02:31:26,789
and took the electric tram into the openair outside the city.

1874
02:31:26,789 --> 02:31:31,063
The car in which they were sitting bythemselves was totally engulfed by the warm

1875
02:31:31,063 --> 02:31:32,989
sun.

1876
02:31:32,989 --> 02:31:37,076
Leaning back comfortably in their seats,they talked to each other about future

1877
02:31:37,076 --> 02:31:44,159
prospects, and they discovered that oncloser observation these were not at all

1878
02:31:44,159 --> 02:31:47,018
bad, for the three of them had employment,

1879
02:31:47,018 --> 02:31:51,649
about which they had not really questionedeach other at all, which was extremely

1880
02:31:51,649 --> 02:31:56,067
favourable and with especially promisingprospects.

1881
02:31:56,067 --> 02:32:01,579
The greatest improvement in their situationat this moment, of course, had to come from

1882
02:32:01,579 --> 02:32:03,008
a change of dwelling.

1883
02:32:03,008 --> 02:32:08,489
Now they wanted to rent an apartmentsmaller and cheaper but better situated and

1884
02:32:08,489 --> 02:32:14,014
generally more practical than the presentone, which Gregor had found.

1885
02:32:14,014 --> 02:32:19,089
While they amused themselves in this way,it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa, almost at the

1886
02:32:19,089 --> 02:32:25,003
same moment, how their daughter, who wasgetting more animated all the time, had

1887
02:32:25,003 --> 02:32:28,159
blossomed recently, in spite of all the

1888
02:32:28,159 --> 02:32:33,088
troubles which had made her cheeks pale,into a beautiful and voluptuous young

1889
02:32:33,088 --> 02:32:35,499
woman.

1890
02:32:35,499 --> 02:32:40,013
Growing more silent and almostunconsciously understanding each other in

1891
02:32:40,013 --> 02:32:45,689
their glances, they thought that the timewas now at hand to seek out a good honest

1892
02:32:45,689 --> 02:32:47,489
man for her.

1893
02:32:47,489 --> 02:32:52,052
And it was something of a confirmation oftheir new dreams and good intentions when

1894
02:32:52,052 --> 99:59:59,999
at the end of their journey their daughtergot up first and stretched her young body.

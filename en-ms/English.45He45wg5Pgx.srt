1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,950
Determine whether the following
numbers are prime, composite,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,510
or neither.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,200
So just as a bit of
review, a prime number

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,560
is a natural number-- so one of
the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3,

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,810
4, 5, 6, so on and so forth--
that has exactly two factors.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:25,580
So its factors are 1 and itself.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,080
So an example of a
prime factor is 3.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,090
There's only two
natural numbers that

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,330
are divisible into 3-- 1 and 3.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,080
Or another way to think about
it is, the only way to get 3

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,220
as a product of other
natural numbers is 1 times 3.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,280
So it only has 1 and itself.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,890
A composite number
is a natural number

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,510
that has more than just
1 and itself as factors.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,150
And we'll see examples of
that and neither-- we'll

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,050
see an interesting case
of that in this problem.

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,082
So first let's think about 24.

19
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:00,540
So let's think
about all of the-- I

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,760
guess you could think of
it as the natural numbers

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,739
or the whole numbers,
although 0 is also

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,870
included in whole numbers.

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,370
Let's think of all of the
natural counting numbers

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,060
that we can actually
divide into 24

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,550
without having any remainder.

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,610
We'd consider those the factors.

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,660
Well, clearly it is
divisible by 1 and 24.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,580
In fact, 1 times
24 is equal to 24.

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,520
But it's also divisible by 2.

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,540
2 times 12 is 24.

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,890
So it's also divisible by 12.

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,510
And it is also divisible by 3.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,110
3 times 8 is also equal to 24.

34
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,910
And even at this point,
we don't actually

35
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,390
have to find all of the factors
to realize that it's not prime.

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,760
It clearly has more factors
than just 1 and itself.

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,065
So then it is clearly
going to be composite.

38
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:52,015

39
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:54,460
This is going to be composite.

40
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,470
Now, let's just finish factoring
it just since we started it.

41
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,290
It's also divisible by 4.

42
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,560
And 4 times 6-- had just
enough space to do that.

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,390
4 times 6 is also 24.

44
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,660
So these are all of the
factors of 24, clearly

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,669
more than just one and 24.

46
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,660
Now let's think about 2.

47
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,010
Well, the non-zero whole numbers
that are divisible into 2,

48
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,430
well, 1 times 2
definitely works, 1 and 2.

49
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,850
But there really
aren't any others

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,370
that are divisible into 2.

51
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,990
And so it only has two
factors, 1 and itself,

52
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,650
and that's the definition
of a prime number.

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,350
So 2 is prime.

54
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,210

55
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,575
And 2 is interesting because it
is the only even prime number.

56
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:48,680

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,760
And that might be
common sense you.

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,930
Because by definition, an
even number is divisible by 2.

59
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,720
So 2 is clearly divisible by 2.

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,930
That's what makes it even.

61
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,461
But it's only
divisible by 2 and 1.

62
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:03,710
So that's what makes it prime.

63
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,490
But anything else
that's even is going

64
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:13,550
to be divisible by
1, itself, and 2.

65
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,420
Any other number
that is even is going

66
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,277
to be divisible by
1, itself, and 2.

67
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,860
So by definition,
it's going to have 1

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,480
and itself and something else.

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,350
So it's going to be composite.

70
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,440
So 2 is prime.

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,880
Every other even number
other than 2 is composite.

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,480
Now, here is an
interesting case.

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,820
1-- 1 is only divisible by 1.

74
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,570
So it is not prime,
technically, because it only

75
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,070
has 1 as a factor.

76
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,840
It does not have two factors.

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,814
1 is itself.

78
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,230
But in order to
be prime, you have

79
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,850
to have exactly two factors.

80
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,400
1 has only one factor.

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,960
In order to be
composite, you have

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,630
to have more than two factors.

83
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,660
You have to have 1, yourself,
and some other things.

84
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,860
So it's not composite.

85
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,090
So 1 is neither
prime nor composite.

86
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,690

87
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,438
And then finally we get to 17.

88
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:20,250
17 Is divisible by 1 and 17.

89
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,990
It's not divisible by 2,
not divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6.

90
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,590
7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, or 16.

91
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,000
So it has exactly two
factors-- 1 and itself.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,928
So 17 is once
again-- 17 is prime.

93
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:39,428

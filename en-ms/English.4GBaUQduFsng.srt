00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A few years ago,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I felt like I was stuck in a rut,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so I decided to follow in the footsteps

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and try something new for 30 days.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The idea is actually pretty simple.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and try it for the next 30 days.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It turns out,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
30 days is just about the right amount of time

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to add a new habit or subtract a habit --

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
like watching the news --

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
from your life.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first was,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
instead of the months flying by, forgotten,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the time was much more memorable.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I remember exactly where I was

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and what I was doing that day.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I also noticed

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
my self-confidence grew.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to the kind of guy who bikes to work --

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for fun.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro,

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the highest mountain in Africa.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I would never have been that adventurous

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
before I started my 30-day challenges.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I also figured out

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that if you really want something badly enough,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you can do anything for 30 days.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Every November,

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
tens of thousands of people

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
try to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
in 30 days.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It turns out, all you have to do

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is write 1,667 words a day

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
for a month.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So I did.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
until you've written your words for the day.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You might be sleep-deprived,

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but you'll finish your novel.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now is my book the next great American novel?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No. I wrote it in a month.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's awful.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But for the rest of my life,

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't have to say,

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
"I'm a computer scientist."

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
(Laughter)

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So here's one last thing I'd like to mention.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes,

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
things I could keep doing,

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
they were more likely to stick.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In fact, they're a ton of fun.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But they're less likely to stick.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When I gave up sugar for 30 days,

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
day 31 looked like this.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
(Laughter)

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So here's my question to you:

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you waiting for?

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I guarantee you the next 30 days

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
are going to pass

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
whether you like it or not,

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so why not think about something

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you have always wanted to try

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and give it a shot

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
for the next 30 days.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thanks.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
(Applause)

CHAPTER ITHERE IS NO ONE LEFT

2
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:11,959
When Mary Lennox was sent to MisselthwaiteManor to live with her uncle everybody said

3
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,008
she was the most disagreeable-looking childever seen.

4
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:16,054
It was true, too.

5
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:21,009
She had a little thin face and a littlethin body, thin light hair and a sour

6
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:21,779
expression.

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,869
Her hair was yellow, and her face wasyellow because she had been born in India

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:28,699
and had always been ill in one way oranother.

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,769
Her father had held a position under theEnglish Government and had always been busy

10
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:36,092
and ill himself, and her mother had been agreat beauty who cared only to go to

11
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:39,067
parties and amuse herself with gay people.

12
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:43,629
She had not wanted a little girl at all,and when Mary was born she handed her over

13
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:47,299
to the care of an Ayah, who was made tounderstand that if she wished to please the

14
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,589
Mem Sahib she must keep the child out ofsight as much as possible.

15
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:55,229
So when she was a sickly, fretful, uglylittle baby she was kept out of the way,

16
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,003
and when she became a sickly, fretful,toddling thing she was kept out of the way

17
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:00,008
also.

18
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:04,489
She never remembered seeing familiarlyanything but the dark faces of her Ayah and

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,039
the other native servants, and as theyalways obeyed her and gave her her own way

20
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,026
in everything, because the Mem Sahib would

21
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:14,008
be angry if she was disturbed by hercrying, by the time she was six years old

22
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:18,082
she was as tyrannical and selfish a littlepig as ever lived.

23
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:22,076
The young English governess who came toteach her to read and write disliked her so

24
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:26,063
much that she gave up her place in threemonths, and when other governesses came to

25
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:30,036
try to fill it they always went away in ashorter time than the first one.

26
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:35,027
So if Mary had not chosen to really want toknow how to read books she would never have

27
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,089
learned her letters at all.

28
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:41,085
One frightfully hot morning, when she wasabout nine years old, she awakened feeling

29
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:46,017
very cross, and she became crosser stillwhen she saw that the servant who stood by

30
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:48,017
her bedside was not her Ayah.

31
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:50,051
"Why did you come?" she said to the strangewoman.

32
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:53,093
"I will not let you stay.Send my Ayah to me."

33
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:58,029
The woman looked frightened, but she onlystammered that the Ayah could not come and

34
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:02,062
when Mary threw herself into a passion andbeat and kicked her, she looked only more

35
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,038
frightened and repeated that it was not

36
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:06,071
possible for the Ayah to come to MissieSahib.

37
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:10,081
There was something mysterious in the airthat morning.

38
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:14,002
Nothing was done in its regular order andseveral of the native servants seemed

39
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:20,013
missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk orhurried about with ashy and scared faces.

40
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:23,094
But no one would tell her anything and herAyah did not come.

41
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:27,087
She was actually left alone as the morningwent on, and at last she wandered out into

42
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:31,093
the garden and began to play by herselfunder a tree near the veranda.

43
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:35,083
She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus

44
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:40,049
blossoms into little heaps of earth, allthe time growing more and more angry and

45
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,000
muttering to herself the things she would

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,093
say and the names she would call Saidiewhen she returned.

47
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:50,036
"Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!" she said,because to call a native a pig is the worst

48
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,013
insult of all.

49
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:55,097
She was grinding her teeth and saying thisover and over again when she heard her

50
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:58,042
mother come out on the veranda with someone.

51
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:02,023
She was with a fair young man and theystood talking together in low strange

52
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:05,033
voices.Mary knew the fair young man who looked

53
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,055
like a boy.

54
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:10,036
She had heard that he was a very youngofficer who had just come from England.

55
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,079
The child stared at him, but she staredmost at her mother.

56
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,599
She always did this when she had a chanceto see her, because the Mem Sahib--Mary

57
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,052
used to call her that oftener than anythingelse--was such a tall, slim, pretty person

58
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,004
and wore such lovely clothes.

59
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:28,076
Her hair was like curly silk and she had adelicate little nose which seemed to be

60
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:31,092
disdaining things, and she had largelaughing eyes.

61
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:37,027
All her clothes were thin and floating, andMary said they were "full of lace."

62
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:40,959
They looked fuller of lace than ever thismorning, but her eyes were not laughing at

63
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,003
all.

64
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:46,052
They were large and scared and liftedimploringly to the fair boy officer's face.

65
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,016
"Is it so very bad?Oh, is it?"

66
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:51,019
Mary heard her say.

67
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,043
"Awfully," the young man answered in atrembling voice.

68
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,051
"Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.You ought to have gone to the hills two

69
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,018
weeks ago."

70
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:02,025
The Mem Sahib wrung her hands."Oh, I know I ought!" she cried.

71
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,067
"I only stayed to go to that silly dinnerparty.

72
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,078
What a fool I was!"

73
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:10,036
At that very moment such a loud sound ofwailing broke out from the servants'

74
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:14,569
quarters that she clutched the young man'sarm, and Mary stood shivering from head to

75
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,639
foot.

76
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,049
The wailing grew wilder and wilder."What is it?

77
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,319
What is it?"Mrs. Lennox gasped.

78
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,009
"Some one has died," answered the boyofficer.

79
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,052
"You did not say it had broken out amongyour servants."

80
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,008
"I did not know!" the Mem Sahib cried.

81
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:31,074
"Come with me!Come with me!" and she turned and ran into

82
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,027
the house.

83
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:37,009
After that, appalling things happened, andthe mysteriousness of the morning was

84
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,499
explained to Mary.

85
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:42,289
The cholera had broken out in its mostfatal form and people were dying like

86
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,479
flies.

87
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,199
The Ayah had been taken ill in the night,and it was because she had just died that

88
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,419
the servants had wailed in the huts.

89
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,069
Before the next day three other servantswere dead and others had run away in

90
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,011
terror.There was panic on every side, and dying

91
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,819
people in all the bungalows.

92
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,439
During the confusion and bewilderment ofthe second day Mary hid herself in the

93
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,979
nursery and was forgotten by everyone.

94
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,619
Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her,and strange things happened of which she

95
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:12,279
knew nothing.Mary alternately cried and slept through

96
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,003
the hours.

97
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:17,069
She only knew that people were ill and thatshe heard mysterious and frightening

98
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,018
sounds.

99
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,099
Once she crept into the dining-room andfound it empty, though a partly finished

100
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:25,729
meal was on the table and chairs and plateslooked as if they had been hastily pushed

101
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,349
back when the diners rose suddenly for somereason.

102
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,389
The child ate some fruit and biscuits, andbeing thirsty she drank a glass of wine

103
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,093
which stood nearly filled.

104
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,024
It was sweet, and she did not know howstrong it was.

105
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:41,999
Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, andshe went back to her nursery and shut

106
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:46,259
herself in again, frightened by cries sheheard in the huts and by the hurrying sound

107
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,889
of feet.

108
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,539
The wine made her so sleepy that she couldscarcely keep her eyes open and she lay

109
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,099
down on her bed and knew nothing more for along time.

110
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,889
Many things happened during the hours inwhich she slept so heavily, but she was not

111
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,319
disturbed by the wails and the sound ofthings being carried in and out of the

112
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,169
bungalow.

113
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,819
When she awakened she lay and stared at thewall.

114
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,093
The house was perfectly still.She had never known it to be so silent

115
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,069
before.

116
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,139
She heard neither voices nor footsteps, andwondered if everybody had got well of the

117
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,349
cholera and all the trouble was over.She wondered also who would take care of

118
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,479
her now her Ayah was dead.

119
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,319
There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps shewould know some new stories.

120
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,002
Mary had been rather tired of the old ones.She did not cry because her nurse had died.

121
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:35,229
She was not an affectionate child and hadnever cared much for any one.

122
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,005
The noise and hurrying about and wailingover the cholera had frightened her, and

123
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,083
she had been angry because no one seemed toremember that she was alive.

124
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:46,729
Everyone was too panic-stricken to think ofa little girl no one was fond of.

125
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,879
When people had the cholera it seemed thatthey remembered nothing but themselves.

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,899
But if everyone had got well again, surelysome one would remember and come to look

127
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,719
for her.But no one came, and as she lay waiting the

128
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,055
house seemed to grow more and more silent.

129
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:06,002
She heard something rustling on the mattingand when she looked down she saw a little

130
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:09,046
snake gliding along and watching her witheyes like jewels.

131
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:12,839
She was not frightened, because he was aharmless little thing who would not hurt

132
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,589
her and he seemed in a hurry to get out ofthe room.

133
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,069
He slipped under the door as she watchedhim.

134
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:23,005
"How queer and quiet it is," she said."It sounds as if there were no one in the

135
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:25,077
bungalow but me and the snake."

136
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:29,005
Almost the next minute she heard footstepsin the compound, and then on the veranda.

137
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:33,229
They were men's footsteps, and the menentered the bungalow and talked in low

138
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,599
voices.

139
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,139
No one went to meet or speak to them andthey seemed to open doors and look into

140
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,479
rooms."What desolation!" she heard one voice say.

141
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,569
"That pretty, pretty woman!

142
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,789
I suppose the child, too.I heard there was a child, though no one

143
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:48,959
ever saw her."

144
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,639
Mary was standing in the middle of thenursery when they opened the door a few

145
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,939
minutes later.

146
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,439
She looked an ugly, cross little thing andwas frowning because she was beginning to

147
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,389
be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.

148
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,999
The first man who came in was a largeofficer she had once seen talking to her

149
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:03,929
father.

150
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:08,159
He looked tired and troubled, but when hesaw her he was so startled that he almost

151
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,959
jumped back."Barney!" he cried out.

152
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,589
"There is a child here!

153
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,309
A child alone!In a place like this!

154
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:19,909
Mercy on us, who is she!""I am Mary Lennox," the little girl said,

155
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,879
drawing herself up stiffly.

156
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,055
She thought the man was very rude to callher father's bungalow "A place like this!"

157
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:30,049
"I fell asleep when everyone had thecholera and I have only just wakened up.

158
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,399
Why does nobody come?"

159
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,086
"It is the child no one ever saw!"exclaimed the man, turning to his

160
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:38,419
companions."She has actually been forgotten!"

161
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,057
"Why was I forgotten?"

162
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:43,099
Mary said, stamping her foot."Why does nobody come?"

163
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,063
The young man whose name was Barney lookedat her very sadly.

164
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:51,038
Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyesas if to wink tears away.

165
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:55,097
"Poor little kid!" he said."There is nobody left to come."

166
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:59,081
It was in that strange and sudden way thatMary found out that she had neither father

167
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:04,000
nor mother left; that they had died andbeen carried away in the night, and that

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,086
the few native servants who had not died

169
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,078
also had left the house as quickly as theycould get out of it, none of them even

170
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,051
remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.That was why the place was so quiet.

171
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:18,055
It was true that there was no one in thebungalow but herself and the little

172
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:24,000
rustling snake.

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,299
CHAPTER IIMISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY

175
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,058
Mary had liked to look at her mother from adistance and she had thought her very

176
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:40,037
pretty, but as she knew very little of hershe could scarcely have been expected to

177
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,074
love her or to miss her very much when shewas gone.

178
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:48,023
She did not miss her at all, in fact, andas she was a self-absorbed child she gave

179
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:51,084
her entire thought to herself, as she hadalways done.

180
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:55,063
If she had been older she would no doubthave been very anxious at being left alone

181
00:09:55,063 --> 00:10:00,028
in the world, but she was very young, andas she had always been taken care of, she

182
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:02,048
supposed she always would be.

183
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:06,043
What she thought was that she would like toknow if she was going to nice people, who

184
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:09,075
would be polite to her and give her her ownway as her Ayah and the other native

185
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,076
servants had done.

186
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,989
She knew that she was not going to stay atthe English clergyman's house where she was

187
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,087
taken at first.She did not want to stay.

188
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:22,037
The English clergyman was poor and he hadfive children nearly all the same age and

189
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:26,005
they wore shabby clothes and were alwaysquarreling and snatching toys from each

190
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,079
other.

191
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,011
Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was sodisagreeable to them that after the first

192
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:35,002
day or two nobody would play with her.By the second day they had given her a

193
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,042
nickname which made her furious.

194
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:41,017
It was Basil who thought of it first.Basil was a little boy with impudent blue

195
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,096
eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hatedhim.

196
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:48,033
She was playing by herself under a tree,just as she had been playing the day the

197
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,058
cholera broke out.

198
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:53,077
She was making heaps of earth and paths fora garden and Basil came and stood near to

199
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:56,479
watch her.Presently he got rather interested and

200
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,032
suddenly made a suggestion.

201
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,068
"Why don't you put a heap of stones thereand pretend it is a rockery?" he said.

202
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:04,093
"There in the middle," and he leaned overher to point.

203
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,036
"Go away!" cried Mary.

204
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:09,004
"I don't want boys.Go away!"

205
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:12,077
For a moment Basil looked angry, and thenhe began to tease.

206
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:14,759
He was always teasing his sisters.

207
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,729
He danced round and round her and madefaces and sang and laughed.

208
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:22,081
"Mistress Mary, quite contrary,How does your garden grow?

209
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:27,038
With silver bells, and cockle shells,And marigolds all in a row."

210
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:31,057
He sang it until the other children heardand laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got,

211
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,679
the more they sang "Mistress Mary, quitecontrary"; and after that as long as she

212
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,041
stayed with them they called her "Mistress

213
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,098
Mary Quite Contrary" when they spoke of herto each other, and often when they spoke to

214
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:43,879
her."You are going to be sent home," Basil said

215
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,002
to her, "at the end of the week.

216
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:49,043
And we're glad of it.""I am glad of it, too," answered Mary.

217
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:53,069
"Where is home?""She doesn't know where home is!" said

218
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,569
Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.

219
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:59,026
"It's England, of course.Our grandmama lives there and our sister

220
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:02,083
Mabel was sent to her last year.You are not going to your grandmama.

221
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,001
You have none.

222
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:08,012
You are going to your uncle.His name is Mr. Archibald Craven."

223
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:10,005
"I don't know anything about him," snappedMary.

224
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,066
"I know you don't," Basil answered.

225
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,045
"You don't know anything.Girls never do.

226
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,519
I heard father and mother talking abouthim.

227
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,459
He lives in a great, big, desolate oldhouse in the country and no one goes near

228
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,008
him.He's so cross he won't let them, and they

229
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,083
wouldn't come if he would let them.

230
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:29,097
He's a hunchback, and he's horrid.""I don't believe you," said Mary; and she

231
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:33,001
turned her back and stuck her fingers inher ears, because she would not listen any

232
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,008
more.

233
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:37,073
But she thought over it a great dealafterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her

234
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:41,459
that night that she was going to sail awayto England in a few days and go to her

235
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,009
uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at

236
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,849
Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stonyand stubbornly uninterested that they did

237
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,239
not know what to think about her.

238
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:53,044
They tried to be kind to her, but she onlyturned her face away when Mrs. Crawford

239
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:57,006
attempted to kiss her, and held herselfstiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her

240
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,319
shoulder.

241
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,819
"She is such a plain child," Mrs. Crawfordsaid pityingly, afterward.

242
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,001
"And her mother was such a pretty creature.

243
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:09,028
She had a very pretty manner, too, and Maryhas the most unattractive ways I ever saw

244
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:10,045
in a child.

245
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:14,349
The children call her 'Mistress Mary QuiteContrary,' and though it's naughty of them,

246
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,079
one can't help understanding it."

247
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,011
"Perhaps if her mother had carried herpretty face and her pretty manners oftener

248
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:24,001
into the nursery Mary might have learnedsome pretty ways too.

249
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:27,909
It is very sad, now the poor beautifulthing is gone, to remember that many people

250
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:30,799
never even knew that she had a child atall."

251
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,097
"I believe she scarcely ever looked ather," sighed Mrs. Crawford.

252
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,879
"When her Ayah was dead there was no one togive a thought to the little thing.

253
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,009
Think of the servants running away andleaving her all alone in that deserted

254
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,097
bungalow.

255
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:45,329
Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out ofhis skin when he opened the door and found

256
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:49,012
her standing by herself in the middle ofthe room."

257
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:53,002
Mary made the long voyage to England underthe care of an officer's wife, who was

258
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:56,006
taking her children to leave them in aboarding-school.

259
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,004
She was very much absorbed in her ownlittle boy and girl, and was rather glad to

260
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,008
hand the child over to the woman Mr.Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in

261
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,024
London.

262
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:07,096
The woman was his housekeeper atMisselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs.

263
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,068
Medlock.She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks

264
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,699
and sharp black eyes.

265
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:17,036
She wore a very purple dress, a black silkmantle with jet fringe on it and a black

266
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:21,087
bonnet with purple velvet flowers whichstuck up and trembled when she moved her

267
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,043
head.

268
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:25,091
Mary did not like her at all, but as shevery seldom liked people there was nothing

269
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:29,889
remarkable in that; besides which it wasvery evident Mrs. Medlock did not think

270
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,011
much of her.

271
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:33,075
"My word! she's a plain little piece ofgoods!" she said.

272
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:36,034
"And we'd heard that her mother was abeauty.

273
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:39,169
She hasn't handed much of it down, has she,ma'am?"

274
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,229
"Perhaps she will improve as she growsolder," the officer's wife said good-

275
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,033
naturedly.

276
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:47,046
"If she were not so sallow and had a nicerexpression, her features are rather good.

277
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:51,018
Children alter so much.""She'll have to alter a good deal,"

278
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,789
answered Mrs. Medlock.

279
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:56,729
"And, there's nothing likely to improvechildren at Misselthwaite--if you ask me!"

280
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,003
They thought Mary was not listening becauseshe was standing a little apart from them

281
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:03,002
at the window of the private hotel they hadgone to.

282
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,062
She was watching the passing buses and cabsand people, but she heard quite well and

283
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:11,002
was made very curious about her uncle andthe place he lived in.

284
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:14,759
What sort of a place was it, and what wouldhe be like?

285
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,005
What was a hunchback?She had never seen one.

286
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:20,016
Perhaps there were none in India.

287
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:24,018
Since she had been living in other people'shouses and had had no Ayah, she had begun

288
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:28,039
to feel lonely and to think queer thoughtswhich were new to her.

289
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,096
She had begun to wonder why she had neverseemed to belong to anyone even when her

290
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,015
father and mother had been alive.

291
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:37,059
Other children seemed to belong to theirfathers and mothers, but she had never

292
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:42,084
seemed to really be anyone's little girl.She had had servants, and food and clothes,

293
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:45,021
but no one had taken any notice of her.

294
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,081
She did not know that this was because shewas a disagreeable child; but then, of

295
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,024
course, she did not know she wasdisagreeable.

296
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:55,025
She often thought that other people were,but she did not know that she was so

297
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,019
herself.

298
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,569
She thought Mrs. Medlock the mostdisagreeable person she had ever seen, with

299
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:03,058
her common, highly colored face and hercommon fine bonnet.

300
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:07,006
When the next day they set out on theirjourney to Yorkshire, she walked through

301
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:10,077
the station to the railway carriage withher head up and trying to keep as far away

302
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:15,016
from her as she could, because she did notwant to seem to belong to her.

303
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,509
It would have made her angry to thinkpeople imagined she was her little girl.

304
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,139
But Mrs. Medlock was not in the leastdisturbed by her and her thoughts.

305
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,077
She was the kind of woman who would "standno nonsense from young ones."

306
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:28,055
At least, that is what she would have saidif she had been asked.

307
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:32,031
She had not wanted to go to London justwhen her sister Maria's daughter was going

308
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:35,979
to be married, but she had a comfortable,well paid place as housekeeper at

309
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:38,139
Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in

310
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,349
which she could keep it was to do at oncewhat Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do.

311
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:45,024
She never dared even to ask a question.

312
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:48,091
"Captain Lennox and his wife died of thecholera," Mr. Craven had said in his short,

313
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,979
cold way."Captain Lennox was my wife's brother and I

314
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,033
am their daughter's guardian.

315
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:56,569
The child is to be brought here.You must go to London and bring her

316
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:59,043
yourself."So she packed her small trunk and made the

317
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,729
journey.

318
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,509
Mary sat in her corner of the railwaycarriage and looked plain and fretful.

319
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:09,044
She had nothing to read or to look at, andshe had folded her thin little black-gloved

320
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,639
hands in her lap.

321
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:15,011
Her black dress made her look yellower thanever, and her limp light hair straggled

322
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:19,036
from under her black crepe hat."A more marred-looking young one I never

323
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,097
saw in my life," Mrs. Medlock thought.

324
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:25,012
(Marred is a Yorkshire word and meansspoiled and pettish.)

325
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:29,033
She had never seen a child who sat so stillwithout doing anything; and at last she got

326
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:33,449
tired of watching her and began to talk ina brisk, hard voice.

327
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,041
"I suppose I may as well tell you somethingabout where you are going to," she said.

328
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,097
"Do you know anything about your uncle?""No," said Mary.

329
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:43,041
"Never heard your father and mother talkabout him?"

330
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,539
"No," said Mary frowning.

331
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,699
She frowned because she remembered that herfather and mother had never talked to her

332
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:52,139
about anything in particular.Certainly they had never told her things.

333
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:57,003
"Humph," muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring ather queer, unresponsive little face.

334
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,095
She did not say any more for a few momentsand then she began again.

335
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:03,089
"I suppose you might as well be toldsomething--to prepare you.

336
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,099
You are going to a queer place."

337
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:10,279
Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlocklooked rather discomfited by her apparent

338
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,769
indifference, but, after taking a breath,she went on.

339
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:18,018
"Not but that it's a grand big place in agloomy way, and Mr. Craven's proud of it in

340
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:21,003
his way--and that's gloomy enough, too.

341
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:24,086
The house is six hundred years old and it'son the edge of the moor, and there's near a

342
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:27,083
hundred rooms in it, though most of them'sshut up and locked.

343
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:32,013
And there's pictures and fine old furnitureand things that's been there for ages, and

344
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:36,036
there's a big park round it and gardens andtrees with branches trailing to the ground-

345
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:37,057
-some of them."

346
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:42,000
She paused and took another breath."But there's nothing else," she ended

347
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,067
suddenly.Mary had begun to listen in spite of

348
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,779
herself.

349
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:50,042
It all sounded so unlike India, andanything new rather attracted her.

350
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:53,019
But she did not intend to look as if shewere interested.

351
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:55,839
That was one of her unhappy, disagreeableways.

352
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,024
So she sat still."Well," said Mrs. Medlock.

353
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,062
"What do you think of it?"

354
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:04,074
"Nothing," she answered."I know nothing about such places."

355
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:07,037
That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sortof laugh.

356
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:10,031
"Eh!" she said, "but you are like an oldwoman.

357
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,083
Don't you care?""It doesn't matter" said Mary, "whether I

358
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,399
care or not."

359
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:17,029
"You are right enough there," said Mrs.Medlock.

360
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,075
"It doesn't.

361
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:22,006
What you're to be kept at MisselthwaiteManor for I don't know, unless because it's

362
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,098
the easiest way.He's not going to trouble himself about

363
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:26,048
you, that's sure and certain.

364
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:30,005
He never troubles himself about no one."She stopped herself as if she had just

365
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:34,036
remembered something in time."He's got a crooked back," she said.

366
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,069
"That set him wrong.

367
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:39,041
He was a sour young man and got no good ofall his money and big place till he was

368
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,055
married."Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of

369
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,649
her intention not to seem to care.

370
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,088
She had never thought of the hunchback'sbeing married and she was a trifle

371
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:49,016
surprised.

372
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:52,079
Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was atalkative woman she continued with more

373
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,064
interest.This was one way of passing some of the

374
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:57,035
time, at any rate.

375
00:19:57,035 --> 00:20:00,051
"She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'dhave walked the world over to get her a

376
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:02,025
blade o' grass she wanted.

377
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:05,076
Nobody thought she'd marry him, but shedid, and people said she married him for

378
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:09,089
his money.But she didn't--she didn't," positively.

379
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,091
"When she died--"

380
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:15,039
Mary gave a little involuntary jump."Oh! did she die!" she exclaimed, quite

381
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,068
without meaning to.

382
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:20,073
She had just remembered a French fairystory she had once read called "Riquet a la

383
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,019
Houppe."

384
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,329
It had been about a poor hunchback and abeautiful princess and it had made her

385
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:30,002
suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven."Yes, she died," Mrs. Medlock answered.

386
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:32,003
"And it made him queerer than ever.

387
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:35,018
He cares about nobody.He won't see people.

388
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:38,091
Most of the time he goes away, and when heis at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in

389
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:42,007
the West Wing and won't let any one butPitcher see him.

390
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,042
Pitcher's an old fellow, but he took careof him when he was a child and he knows his

391
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,092
ways."It sounded like something in a book and it

392
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:50,073
did not make Mary feel cheerful.

393
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:55,399
A house with a hundred rooms, nearly allshut up and with their doors locked--a

394
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,099
house on the edge of a moor--whatsoever amoor was--sounded dreary.

395
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,004
A man with a crooked back who shut himselfup also!

396
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:06,098
She stared out of the window with her lipspinched together, and it seemed quite

397
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:11,459
natural that the rain should have begun topour down in gray slanting lines and splash

398
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:14,017
and stream down the window-panes.

399
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:17,072
If the pretty wife had been alive she mighthave made things cheerful by being

400
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:21,459
something like her own mother and byrunning in and out and going to parties as

401
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:23,086
she had done in frocks "full of lace."

402
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:27,769
But she was not there any more."You needn't expect to see him, because ten

403
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:31,016
to one you won't," said Mrs. Medlock."And you mustn't expect that there will be

404
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:31,099
people to talk to you.

405
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:34,075
You'll have to play about and look afteryourself.

406
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,035
You'll be told what rooms you can go intoand what rooms you're to keep out of.

407
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,069
There's gardens enough.

408
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,007
But when you're in the house don't gowandering and poking about.

409
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,063
Mr. Craven won't have it."

410
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:49,035
"I shall not want to go poking about," saidsour little Mary and just as suddenly as

411
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:53,003
she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr.Archibald Craven she began to cease to be

412
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:57,085
sorry and to think he was unpleasant enoughto deserve all that had happened to him.

413
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,579
And she turned her face toward thestreaming panes of the window of the

414
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:04,032
railway carriage and gazed out at the grayrain-storm which looked as if it would go

415
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,519
on forever and ever.

416
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:10,025
She watched it so long and steadily thatthe grayness grew heavier and heavier

417
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:16,025
before her eyes and she fell asleep.

418
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,025
>

419
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:25,075
CHAPTER IIIACROSS THE MOOR

420
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:29,719
She slept a long time, and when sheawakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a

421
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:33,759
lunchbasket at one of the stations and theyhad some chicken and cold beef and bread

422
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,003
and butter and some hot tea.

423
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:40,068
The rain seemed to be streaming down moreheavily than ever and everybody in the

424
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,579
station wore wet and glisteningwaterproofs.

425
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:47,016
The guard lighted the lamps in thecarriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very

426
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:49,066
much over her tea and chicken and beef.

427
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:54,047
She ate a great deal and afterward fellasleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at

428
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:59,044
her and watched her fine bonnet slip on oneside until she herself fell asleep once

429
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,064
more in the corner of the carriage, lulled

430
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:04,061
by the splashing of the rain against thewindows.

431
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:09,001
It was quite dark when she awakened again.The train had stopped at a station and Mrs.

432
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,059
Medlock was shaking her.

433
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:13,092
"You have had a sleep!" she said."It's time to open your eyes!

434
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:17,094
We're at Thwaite Station and we've got along drive before us."

435
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:21,829
Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyesopen while Mrs. Medlock collected her

436
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:22,509
parcels.

437
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:26,014
The little girl did not offer to help her,because in India native servants always

438
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:29,086
picked up or carried things and it seemedquite proper that other people should wait

439
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:31,004
on one.

440
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:35,000
The station was a small one and nobody butthemselves seemed to be getting out of the

441
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,093
train.

442
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:40,019
The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock ina rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his

443
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,011
words in a queer broad fashion which Maryfound out afterward was Yorkshire.

444
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:46,013
"I see tha's got back," he said.

445
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:50,659
"An' tha's browt th' young 'un with thee.""Aye, that's her," answered Mrs. Medlock,

446
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,027
speaking with a Yorkshire accent herselfand jerking her head over her shoulder

447
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,039
toward Mary.

448
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,003
"How's thy Missus?""Well enow.

449
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:02,439
Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee."A brougham stood on the road before the

450
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,031
little outside platform.

451
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:08,029
Mary saw that it was a smart carriage andthat it was a smart footman who helped her

452
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,009
in.

453
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:13,001
His long waterproof coat and the waterproofcovering of his hat were shining and

454
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:18,079
dripping with rain as everything was, theburly station-master included.

455
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,063
When he shut the door, mounted the box withthe coachman, and they drove off, the

456
00:24:21,063 --> 00:24:25,869
little girl found herself seated in acomfortably cushioned corner, but she was

457
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,067
not inclined to go to sleep again.

458
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:31,005
She sat and looked out of the window,curious to see something of the road over

459
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:35,045
which she was being driven to the queerplace Mrs. Medlock had spoken of.

460
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:39,056
She was not at all a timid child and shewas not exactly frightened, but she felt

461
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:43,026
that there was no knowing what might happenin a house with a hundred rooms nearly all

462
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:47,003
shut up--a house standing on the edge of amoor.

463
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:50,037
"What is a moor?" she said suddenly to Mrs.Medlock.

464
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:53,022
"Look out of the window in about tenminutes and you'll see," the woman

465
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:55,007
answered."We've got to drive five miles across

466
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,095
Missel Moor before we get to the Manor.

467
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:02,058
You won't see much because it's a darknight, but you can see something."

468
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:06,037
Mary asked no more questions but waited inthe darkness of her corner, keeping her

469
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,002
eyes on the window.

470
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:11,084
The carriage lamps cast rays of light alittle distance ahead of them and she

471
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:15,129
caught glimpses of the things they passed.

472
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:18,058
After they had left the station they haddriven through a tiny village and she had

473
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,000
seen whitewashed cottages and the lights ofa public house.

474
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,055
Then they had passed a church and avicarage and a little shop-window or so in

475
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:29,069
a cottage with toys and sweets and oddthings set out for sale.

476
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,069
Then they were on the highroad and she sawhedges and trees.

477
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:37,045
After that there seemed nothing differentfor a long time--or at least it seemed a

478
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:39,003
long time to her.

479
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:43,008
At last the horses began to go more slowly,as if they were climbing up-hill, and

480
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:47,269
presently there seemed to be no more hedgesand no more trees.

481
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:51,053
She could see nothing, in fact, but a densedarkness on either side.

482
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:54,084
She leaned forward and pressed her faceagainst the window just as the carriage

483
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:55,007
gave a big jolt.

484
00:25:55,007 --> 00:26:00,007
"Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,"said Mrs. Medlock.

485
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:05,099
The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on arough-looking road which seemed to be cut

486
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,003
through bushes and low-growing things whichended in the great expanse of dark

487
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:12,003
apparently spread out before and aroundthem.

488
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:16,239
A wind was rising and making a singular,wild, low, rushing sound.

489
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:21,045
"It's--it's not the sea, is it?" said Mary,looking round at her companion.

490
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,909
"No, not it," answered Mrs. Medlock.

491
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:28,879
"Nor it isn't fields nor mountains, it'sjust miles and miles and miles of wild land

492
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:33,011
that nothing grows on but heather and gorseand broom, and nothing lives on but wild

493
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:34,199
ponies and sheep."

494
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:39,379
"I feel as if it might be the sea, if therewere water on it," said Mary.

495
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,083
"It sounds like the sea just now.""That's the wind blowing through the

496
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,011
bushes," Mrs. Medlock said.

497
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:48,539
"It's a wild, dreary enough place to mymind, though there's plenty that likes it--

498
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,008
particularly when the heather's in bloom."

499
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,669
On and on they drove through the darkness,and though the rain stopped, the wind

500
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:59,309
rushed by and whistled and made strangesounds.

501
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,119
The road went up and down, and severaltimes the carriage passed over a little

502
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,096
bridge beneath which water rushed very fastwith a great deal of noise.

503
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:12,096
Mary felt as if the drive would never cometo an end and that the wide, bleak moor was

504
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:18,039
a wide expanse of black ocean through whichshe was passing on a strip of dry land.

505
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,619
"I don't like it," she said to herself.

506
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:25,199
"I don't like it," and she pinched her thinlips more tightly together.

507
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:29,309
The horses were climbing up a hilly pieceof road when she first caught sight of a

508
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:29,669
light.

509
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:33,061
Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did anddrew a long sigh of relief.

510
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:37,309
"Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' lighttwinkling," she exclaimed.

511
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:39,039
"It's the light in the lodge window.

512
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,119
We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit,at all events."

513
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,011
It was "after a bit," as she said, for whenthe carriage passed through the park gates

514
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:50,099
there was still two miles of avenue todrive through and the trees (which nearly

515
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,129
met overhead) made it seem as if they weredriving through a long dark vault.

516
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:59,159
They drove out of the vault into a clearspace and stopped before an immensely long

517
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,399
but low-built house which seemed to rambleround a stone court.

518
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:07,129
At first Mary thought that there were nolights at all in the windows, but as she

519
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:11,021
got out of the carriage she saw that oneroom in a corner upstairs showed a dull

520
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:12,569
glow.

521
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,659
The entrance door was a huge one made ofmassive, curiously shaped panels of oak

522
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:21,027
studded with big iron nails and bound withgreat iron bars.

523
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:25,149
It opened into an enormous hall, which wasso dimly lighted that the faces in the

524
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:29,149
portraits on the walls and the figures inthe suits of armor made Mary feel that she

525
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:30,099
did not want to look at them.

526
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:35,789
As she stood on the stone floor she lookeda very small, odd little black figure, and

527
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,049
she felt as small and lost and odd as shelooked.

528
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:43,559
A neat, thin old man stood near themanservant who opened the door for them.

529
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,349
"You are to take her to her room," he saidin a husky voice.

530
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,869
"He doesn't want to see her.

531
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:51,379
He's going to London in the morning.""Very well, Mr. Pitcher," Mrs. Medlock

532
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,077
answered."So long as I know what's expected of me, I

533
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,139
can manage."

534
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:58,509
"What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock," Mr.Pitcher said, "is that you make sure that

535
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:03,021
he's not disturbed and that he doesn't seewhat he doesn't want to see."

536
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:07,809
And then Mary Lennox was led up a broadstaircase and down a long corridor and up a

537
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,319
short flight of steps and through anothercorridor and another, until a door opened

538
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,649
in a wall and she found herself in a roomwith a fire in it and a supper on a table.

539
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:20,229
Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:"Well, here you are!

540
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:22,839
This room and the next are where you'lllive--and you must keep to them.

541
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,789
Don't you forget that!"

542
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,033
It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived atMisselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps

543
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:36,025
never felt quite so contrary in all herlife.

544
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,025
>

545
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:44,091
CHAPTER IVMARTHA

546
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:48,079
When she opened her eyes in the morning itwas because a young housemaid had come into

547
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,082
her room to light the fire and was kneelingon the hearth-rug raking out the cinders

548
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,389
noisily.

549
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:58,008
Mary lay and watched her for a few momentsand then began to look about the room.

550
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:03,026
She had never seen a room at all like itand thought it curious and gloomy.

551
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:06,289
The walls were covered with tapestry with aforest scene embroidered on it.

552
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:10,023
There were fantastically dressed peopleunder the trees and in the distance there

553
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:12,409
was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.

554
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:16,339
There were hunters and horses and dogs andladies.

555
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:19,109
Mary felt as if she were in the forest withthem.

556
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,078
Out of a deep window she could see a greatclimbing stretch of land which seemed to

557
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:28,001
have no trees on it, and to look ratherlike an endless, dull, purplish sea.

558
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:31,879
"What is that?" she said, pointing out ofthe window.

559
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:36,299
Martha, the young housemaid, who had justrisen to her feet, looked and pointed also.

560
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,179
"That there?" she said.

561
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,929
"Yes.""That's th' moor," with a good-natured

562
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:41,069
grin."Does tha' like it?"

563
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:43,035
"No," answered Mary.

564
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:46,007
"I hate it.""That's because tha'rt not used to it,"

565
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:50,052
Martha said, going back to her hearth."Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now.

566
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:51,619
But tha' will like it."

567
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:56,409
"Do you?" inquired Mary."Aye, that I do," answered Martha,

568
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:59,439
cheerfully polishing away at the grate."I just love it.

569
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,579
It's none bare.

570
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:03,289
It's covered wi' growin' things as smellssweet.

571
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:06,619
It's fair lovely in spring an' summer whenth' gorse an' broom an' heather's in

572
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:07,549
flower.

573
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,719
It smells o' honey an' there's such a loto' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high an'

574
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:15,119
th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nicenoise hummin' an' singin'.

575
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,999
Eh! I wouldn't live away from th' moor foranythin'."

576
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,014
Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzledexpression.

577
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:25,109
The native servants she had been used to inIndia were not in the least like this.

578
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:29,569
They were obsequious and servile and didnot presume to talk to their masters as if

579
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:30,789
they were their equals.

580
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,159
They made salaams and called them"protector of the poor" and names of that

581
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,085
sort.Indian servants were commanded to do

582
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:38,369
things, not asked.

583
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:42,399
It was not the custom to say "please" and"thank you" and Mary had always slapped her

584
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,056
Ayah in the face when she was angry.She wondered a little what this girl would

585
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:48,319
do if one slapped her in the face.

586
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,067
She was a round, rosy, good-natured-lookingcreature, but she had a sturdy way which

587
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:56,086
made Mistress Mary wonder if she might noteven slap back--if the person who slapped

588
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:59,014
her was only a little girl.

589
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:02,051
"You are a strange servant," she said fromher pillows, rather haughtily.

590
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:06,011
Martha sat up on her heels, with herblacking-brush in her hand, and laughed,

591
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,959
without seeming the least out of temper.

592
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,036
"Eh! I know that," she said."If there was a grand Missus at

593
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:14,011
Misselthwaite I should never have been evenone of th' under house-maids.

594
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:18,004
I might have been let to be scullerymaidbut I'd never have been let upstairs.

595
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:20,072
I'm too common an' I talk too muchYorkshire.

596
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:24,048
But this is a funny house for all it's sogrand.

597
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:28,239
Seems like there's neither Master norMistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs.

598
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:28,065
Medlock.

599
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:31,879
Mr. Craven, he won't be troubled aboutanythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly

600
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:35,022
always away.Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o'

601
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:35,489
kindness.

602
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:38,089
She told me she could never have done it ifMisselthwaite had been like other big

603
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,068
houses.""Are you going to be my servant?"

604
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:43,159
Mary asked, still in her imperious littleIndian way.

605
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,159
Martha began to rub her grate again."I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant," she said

606
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:48,709
stoutly.

607
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:52,076
"An' she's Mr. Craven's--but I'm to do thehousemaid's work up here an' wait on you a

608
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,007
bit.But you won't need much waitin' on."

609
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:57,989
"Who is going to dress me?" demanded Mary.

610
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:00,037
Martha sat up on her heels again andstared.

611
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,769
She spoke in broad Yorkshire in heramazement.

612
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:04,849
"Canna' tha' dress thysen!" she said.

613
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,025
"What do you mean?I don't understand your language," said

614
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:11,719
Mary."Eh! I forgot," Martha said.

615
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:14,075
"Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to becareful or you wouldn't know what I was

616
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,023
sayin'.I mean can't you put on your own clothes?"

617
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:20,011
"No," answered Mary, quite indignantly.

618
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:24,319
"I never did in my life.My Ayah dressed me, of course."

619
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,009
"Well," said Martha, evidently not in theleast aware that she was impudent, "it's

620
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:29,799
time tha' should learn.

621
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,609
Tha' cannot begin younger.It'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit.

622
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:37,379
My mother always said she couldn't see whygrand people's children didn't turn out

623
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:40,939
fair fools--what with nurses an' bein'washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as

624
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:41,629
if they was puppies!"

625
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:46,069
"It is different in India," said MistressMary disdainfully.

626
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:49,489
She could scarcely stand this.But Martha was not at all crushed.

627
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:52,609
"Eh! I can see it's different," sheanswered almost sympathetically.

628
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:56,044
"I dare say it's because there's such a loto' blacks there instead o' respectable

629
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:57,007
white people.

630
00:33:57,007 --> 00:34:01,056
When I heard you was comin' from India Ithought you was a black too."

631
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:07,005
Mary sat up in bed furious."What!" she said.

632
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:07,053
"What!

633
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:11,077
You thought I was a native.You--you daughter of a pig!"

634
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:16,024
Martha stared and looked hot."Who are you callin' names?" she said.

635
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:17,044
"You needn't be so vexed.

636
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:20,074
That's not th' way for a young lady totalk.

637
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:23,054
I've nothin' against th' blacks.When you read about 'em in tracts they're

638
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:25,008
always very religious.

639
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,048
You always read as a black's a man an' abrother.

640
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:31,019
I've never seen a black an' I was fairpleased to think I was goin' to see one

641
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:31,033
close.

642
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:34,028
When I come in to light your fire thismornin' I crep' up to your bed an' pulled

643
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:36,088
th' cover back careful to look at you.

644
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:41,048
An' there you was," disappointedly, "nomore black than me--for all you're so

645
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:43,088
yeller."Mary did not even try to control her rage

646
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,074
and humiliation.

647
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:47,052
"You thought I was a native!You dared!

648
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:52,023
You don't know anything about natives!They are not people--they're servants who

649
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,044
must salaam to you.

650
00:34:53,044 --> 00:34:57,094
You know nothing about India.You know nothing about anything!"

651
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:02,058
She was in such a rage and felt so helplessbefore the girl's simple stare, and somehow

652
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:07,038
she suddenly felt so horribly lonely andfar away from everything she understood and

653
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,031
which understood her, that she threw

654
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:13,022
herself face downward on the pillows andburst into passionate sobbing.

655
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:17,033
She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little

656
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,043
frightened and quite sorry for her.

657
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:23,032
She went to the bed and bent over her."Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!" she

658
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:25,002
begged."You mustn't for sure.

659
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,042
I didn't know you'd be vexed.

660
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:29,006
I don't know anythin' about anythin'--justlike you said.

661
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:32,033
I beg your pardon, Miss.Do stop cryin'."

662
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:36,043
There was something comforting and reallyfriendly in her queer Yorkshire speech and

663
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:41,013
sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary.She gradually ceased crying and became

664
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,055
quiet.

665
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,055
Martha looked relieved."It's time for thee to get up now," she

666
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:45,097
said.

667
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:49,029
"Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha'breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room

668
00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:51,039
next to this.It's been made into a nursery for thee.

669
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,063
I'll help thee on with thy clothes iftha'll get out o' bed.

670
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:58,006
If th' buttons are at th' back tha' cannotbutton them up tha'self."

671
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:02,021
When Mary at last decided to get up, theclothes Martha took from the wardrobe were

672
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:05,062
not the ones she had worn when she arrivedthe night before with Mrs. Medlock.

673
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,031
"Those are not mine," she said.

674
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,008
"Mine are black."She looked the thick white wool coat and

675
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:15,022
dress over, and added with cool approval:"Those are nicer than mine."

676
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:18,003
"These are th' ones tha' must put on,"Martha answered.

677
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:20,077
"Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'emin London.

678
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:24,047
He said 'I won't have a child dressed inblack wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he

679
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:27,036
said.'It'd make the place sadder than it is.

680
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:28,086
Put color on her.'

681
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:32,024
Mother she said she knew what he meant.Mother always knows what a body means.

682
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:36,007
She doesn't hold with black hersel'.""I hate black things," said Mary.

683
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,095
The dressing process was one which taughtthem both something.

684
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:43,058
Martha had "buttoned up" her little sistersand brothers but she had never seen a child

685
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:47,018
who stood still and waited for anotherperson to do things for her as if she had

686
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:49,016
neither hands nor feet of her own.

687
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:53,072
"Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?"she said when Mary quietly held out her

688
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:56,021
foot."My Ayah did it," answered Mary, staring.

689
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:58,024
"It was the custom."

690
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:01,004
She said that very often--"It was thecustom."

691
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:02,096
The native servants were always saying it.

692
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:06,064
If one told them to do a thing theirancestors had not done for a thousand years

693
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:10,099
they gazed at one mildly and said, "It isnot the custom" and one knew that was the

694
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,037
end of the matter.

695
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:15,051
It had not been the custom that MistressMary should do anything but stand and allow

696
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:18,089
herself to be dressed like a doll, butbefore she was ready for breakfast she

697
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:20,038
began to suspect that her life at

698
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:24,053
Misselthwaite Manor would end by teachingher a number of things quite new to her--

699
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:28,034
things such as putting on her own shoes andstockings, and picking up things she let

700
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,024
fall.

701
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:32,099
If Martha had been a well-trained fineyoung lady's maid she would have been more

702
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,034
subservient and respectful and would haveknown that it was her business to brush

703
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:39,071
hair, and button boots, and pick things upand lay them away.

704
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:43,009
She was, however, only an untrainedYorkshire rustic who had been brought up in

705
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:47,057
a moorland cottage with a swarm of littlebrothers and sisters who had never dreamed

706
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,052
of doing anything but waiting on themselves

707
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:53,014
and on the younger ones who were eitherbabies in arms or just learning to totter

708
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:54,096
about and tumble over things.

709
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:59,077
If Mary Lennox had been a child who wasready to be amused she would perhaps have

710
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:04,011
laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, butMary only listened to her coldly and

711
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:06,018
wondered at her freedom of manner.

712
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:10,529
At first she was not at all interested, butgradually, as the girl rattled on in her

713
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:14,229
good-tempered, homely way, Mary began tonotice what she was saying.

714
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:16,024
"Eh! you should see 'em all," she said.

715
00:38:16,024 --> 00:38:20,005
"There's twelve of us an' my father onlygets sixteen shilling a week.

716
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:23,089
I can tell you my mother's put to it to getporridge for 'em all.

717
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:26,509
They tumble about on th' moor an' playthere all day an' mother says th' air of

718
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:29,339
th' moor fattens 'em.She says she believes they eat th' grass

719
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,089
same as th' wild ponies do.

720
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:34,081
Our Dickon, he's twelve years old and he'sgot a young pony he calls his own."

721
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,022
"Where did he get it?" asked Mary.

722
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:40,016
"He found it on th' moor with its motherwhen it was a little one an' he began to

723
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:43,769
make friends with it an' give it bits o'bread an' pluck young grass for it.

724
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:49,041
And it got to like him so it follows himabout an' it lets him get on its back.

725
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,629
Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him."

726
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:54,209
Mary had never possessed an animal pet ofher own and had always thought she should

727
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:54,099
like one.

728
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:59,023
So she began to feel a slight interest inDickon, and as she had never before been

729
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:04,037
interested in any one but herself, it wasthe dawning of a healthy sentiment.

730
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:07,073
When she went into the room which had beenmade into a nursery for her, she found that

731
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:09,529
it was rather like the one she had sleptin.

732
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:14,012
It was not a child's room, but a grown-upperson's room, with gloomy old pictures on

733
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:18,056
the walls and heavy old oak chairs.A table in the center was set with a good

734
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,699
substantial breakfast.

735
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:23,006
But she had always had a very smallappetite, and she looked with something

736
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:26,899
more than indifference at the first plateMartha set before her.

737
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:28,067
"I don't want it," she said.

738
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:32,079
"Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!"Martha exclaimed incredulously.

739
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,004
"No.""Tha' doesn't know how good it is.

740
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:37,899
Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bit o'sugar."

741
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:41,072
"I don't want it," repeated Mary."Eh!" said Martha.

742
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:44,699
"I can't abide to see good victuals go towaste.

743
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:48,041
If our children was at this table they'dclean it bare in five minutes."

744
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,048
"Why?" said Mary coldly.

745
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:53,999
"Why!" echoed Martha."Because they scarce ever had their

746
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,022
stomachs full in their lives.They're as hungry as young hawks an'

747
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,056
foxes."

748
00:39:58,056 --> 00:40:02,036
"I don't know what it is to be hungry,"said Mary, with the indifference of

749
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:03,066
ignorance.Martha looked indignant.

750
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:06,499
"Well, it would do thee good to try it.

751
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:08,749
I can see that plain enough," she saidoutspokenly.

752
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:12,072
"I've no patience with folk as sits an'just stares at good bread an' meat.

753
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:17,149
My word! don't I wish Dickon and Phil an'Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here

754
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:20,037
under their pinafores.""Why don't you take it to them?" suggested

755
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:20,899
Mary.

756
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:25,043
"It's not mine," answered Martha stoutly."An' this isn't my day out.

757
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:27,092
I get my day out once a month same as th'rest.

758
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:31,829
Then I go home an' clean up for mother an'give her a day's rest."

759
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:35,259
Mary drank some tea and ate a little toastand some marmalade.

760
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,939
"You wrap up warm an' run out an' playyou," said Martha.

761
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:41,029
"It'll do you good and give you somestomach for your meat."

762
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:42,459
Mary went to the window.

763
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:47,062
There were gardens and paths and big trees,but everything looked dull and wintry.

764
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:50,081
"Out? Why should I go out on a day likethis?"

765
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:53,097
"Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'lt haveto stay in, an' what has tha' got to do?"

766
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:58,018
Mary glanced about her.There was nothing to do.

767
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:02,649
When Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nurseryshe had not thought of amusement.

768
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:05,099
Perhaps it would be better to go and seewhat the gardens were like.

769
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,519
"Who will go with me?" she inquired.

770
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,092
Martha stared."You'll go by yourself," she answered.

771
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:14,017
"You'll have to learn to play like otherchildren does when they haven't got sisters

772
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:15,016
and brothers.

773
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:17,769
Our Dickon goes off on th' moor by himselfan' plays for hours.

774
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,089
That's how he made friends with th' pony.

775
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:23,319
He's got sheep on th' moor that knows him,an' birds as comes an' eats out of his

776
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,949
hand.However little there is to eat, he always

777
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,067
saves a bit o' his bread to coax his pets."

778
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:33,005
It was really this mention of Dickon whichmade Mary decide to go out, though she was

779
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:36,319
not aware of it.There would be, birds outside though there

780
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,959
would not be ponies or sheep.

781
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:42,649
They would be different from the birds inIndia and it might amuse her to look at

782
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:43,029
them.

783
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:46,008
Martha found her coat and hat for her and apair of stout little boots and she showed

784
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:48,029
her her way downstairs.

785
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:53,129
"If tha' goes round that way tha'll come toth' gardens," she said, pointing to a gate

786
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:55,959
in a wall of shrubbery."There's lots o' flowers in summer-time,

787
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,087
but there's nothin' bloomin' now."

788
00:41:57,087 --> 00:42:02,055
She seemed to hesitate a second before sheadded, "One of th' gardens is locked up.

789
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:07,003
No one has been in it for ten years.""Why?" asked Mary in spite of herself.

790
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:11,129
Here was another locked door added to thehundred in the strange house.

791
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:14,017
"Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife diedso sudden.

792
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:15,098
He won't let no one go inside.

793
00:42:15,098 --> 00:42:19,529
It was her garden.He locked th' door an' dug a hole and

794
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:22,199
buried th' key.There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing--I must

795
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:22,319
run."

796
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,389
After she was gone Mary turned down thewalk which led to the door in the

797
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:27,809
shrubbery.

798
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:31,043
She could not help thinking about thegarden which no one had been into for ten

799
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:31,899
years.

800
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:35,072
She wondered what it would look like andwhether there were any flowers still alive

801
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:36,319
in it.

802
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,059
When she had passed through the shrubberygate she found herself in great gardens,

803
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,091
with wide lawns and winding walks withclipped borders.

804
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:47,749
There were trees, and flower-beds, andevergreens clipped into strange shapes, and

805
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:50,639
a large pool with an old gray fountain inits midst.

806
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,093
But the flower-beds were bare and wintryand the fountain was not playing.

807
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:59,199
This was not the garden which was shut up.How could a garden be shut up?

808
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,087
You could always walk into a garden.

809
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:04,949
She was just thinking this when she sawthat, at the end of the path she was

810
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:09,209
following, there seemed to be a long wall,with ivy growing over it.

811
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:12,769
She was not familiar enough with England toknow that she was coming upon the kitchen-

812
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:15,249
gardens where the vegetables and fruit weregrowing.

813
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:18,749
She went toward the wall and found thatthere was a green door in the ivy, and that

814
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:22,259
it stood open.This was not the closed garden, evidently,

815
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:23,879
and she could go into it.

816
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:27,439
She went through the door and found that itwas a garden with walls all round it and

817
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,589
that it was only one of several walledgardens which seemed to open into one

818
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:32,003
another.

819
00:43:32,003 --> 00:43:35,939
She saw another open green door, revealingbushes and pathways between beds containing

820
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:37,449
winter vegetables.

821
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:41,879
Fruit-trees were trained flat against thewall, and over some of the beds there were

822
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:44,459
glass frames.The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary

823
00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:46,769
thought, as she stood and stared about her.

824
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:50,069
It might be nicer in summer when thingswere green, but there was nothing pretty

825
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:52,059
about it now.

826
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:55,439
Presently an old man with a spade over hisshoulder walked through the door leading

827
00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:58,699
from the second garden.He looked startled when he saw Mary, and

828
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:00,003
then touched his cap.

829
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:04,619
He had a surly old face, and did not seemat all pleased to see her--but then she was

830
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:08,569
displeased with his garden and wore her"quite contrary" expression, and certainly

831
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:10,869
did not seem at all pleased to see him.

832
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:15,054
"What is this place?" she asked."One o' th' kitchen-gardens," he answered.

833
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:18,499
"What is that?" said Mary, pointing throughthe other green door.

834
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,022
"Another of 'em," shortly.

835
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:23,067
"There's another on t'other side o' th'wall an' there's th' orchard t'other side

836
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:26,309
o' that.""Can I go in them?" asked Mary.

837
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:27,055
"If tha' likes.

838
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:31,529
But there's nowt to see."Mary made no response.

839
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:33,649
She went down the path and through thesecond green door.

840
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:38,016
There, she found more walls and wintervegetables and glass frames, but in the

841
00:44:38,016 --> 00:44:41,509
second wall there was another green doorand it was not open.

842
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:44,569
Perhaps it led into the garden which no onehad seen for ten years.

843
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:49,069
As she was not at all a timid child andalways did what she wanted to do, Mary went

844
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:51,129
to the green door and turned the handle.

845
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:54,019
She hoped the door would not open becauseshe wanted to be sure she had found the

846
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:58,003
mysterious garden--but it did open quiteeasily and she walked through it and found

847
00:44:58,003 --> 00:44:59,569
herself in an orchard.

848
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:04,379
There were walls all round it also andtrees trained against them, and there were

849
00:45:04,379 --> 00:45:07,819
bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass--but there was no green door

850
00:45:07,819 --> 00:45:08,099
to be seen anywhere.

851
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:13,016
Mary looked for it, and yet when she hadentered the upper end of the garden she had

852
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:16,999
noticed that the wall did not seem to endwith the orchard but to extend beyond it as

853
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,061
if it enclosed a place at the other side.

854
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:23,054
She could see the tops of trees above thewall, and when she stood still she saw a

855
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:27,047
bird with a bright red breast sitting onthe topmost branch of one of them, and

856
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:29,559
suddenly he burst into his winter song--

857
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,819
almost as if he had caught sight of her andwas calling to her.

858
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:37,089
She stopped and listened to him and somehowhis cheerful, friendly little whistle gave

859
00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:41,639
her a pleased feeling--even a disagreeablelittle girl may be lonely, and the big

860
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:45,001
closed house and big bare moor and big bare

861
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:49,439
gardens had made this one feel as if therewas no one left in the world but herself.

862
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,073
If she had been an affectionate child, whohad been used to being loved, she would

863
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:57,259
have broken her heart, but even though shewas "Mistress Mary Quite Contrary" she was

864
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:59,199
desolate, and the bright-breasted little

865
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,072
bird brought a look into her sour littleface which was almost a smile.

866
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:05,889
She listened to him until he flew away.

867
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:10,001
He was not like an Indian bird and sheliked him and wondered if she should ever

868
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:13,679
see him again.Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden

869
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,449
and knew all about it.

870
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:18,689
Perhaps it was because she had nothingwhatever to do that she thought so much of

871
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,092
the deserted garden.She was curious about it and wanted to see

872
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,309
what it was like.

873
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:26,429
Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried thekey?

874
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:30,016
If he had liked his wife so much why did hehate her garden?

875
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:33,047
She wondered if she should ever see him,but she knew that if she did she should not

876
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:37,061
like him, and he would not like her, andthat she should only stand and stare at him

877
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:39,022
and say nothing, though she should be

878
00:46:39,022 --> 00:46:42,088
wanting dreadfully to ask him why he haddone such a queer thing.

879
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:45,094
"People never like me and I never likepeople," she thought.

880
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,065
"And I never can talk as the Crawfordchildren could.

881
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:52,064
They were always talking and laughing andmaking noises."

882
00:46:52,064 --> 00:46:56,038
She thought of the robin and of the way heseemed to sing his song at her, and as she

883
00:46:56,038 --> 00:47:00,026
remembered the tree-top he perched on shestopped rather suddenly on the path.

884
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:06,057
"I believe that tree was in the secretgarden--I feel sure it was," she said.

885
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:09,074
"There was a wall round the place and therewas no door."

886
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:13,037
She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found the old

887
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:16,052
man digging there.She went and stood beside him and watched

888
00:47:16,052 --> 00:47:18,069
him a few moments in her cold little way.

889
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:22,014
He took no notice of her and so at last shespoke to him.

890
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:24,028
"I have been into the other gardens," shesaid.

891
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:27,004
"There was nothin' to prevent thee," heanswered crustily.

892
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:30,081
"I went into the orchard.""There was no dog at th' door to bite

893
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,008
thee," he answered.

894
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:36,000
"There was no door there into the othergarden," said Mary.

895
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,018
"What garden?" he said in a rough voice,stopping his digging for a moment.

896
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:42,086
"The one on the other side of the wall,"answered Mistress Mary.

897
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:45,009
"There are trees there--I saw the tops ofthem.

898
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:49,032
A bird with a red breast was sitting on oneof them and he sang."

899
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:53,021
To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its

900
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:54,036
expression.

901
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:58,021
A slow smile spread over it and thegardener looked quite different.

902
00:47:58,021 --> 00:48:02,044
It made her think that it was curious howmuch nicer a person looked when he smiled.

903
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:04,054
She had not thought of it before.

904
00:48:04,054 --> 00:48:09,001
He turned about to the orchard side of hisgarden and began to whistle--a low soft

905
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:11,092
whistle.She could not understand how such a surly

906
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:14,079
man could make such a coaxing sound.

907
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,004
Almost the next moment a wonderful thinghappened.

908
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:20,087
She heard a soft little rushing flightthrough the air--and it was the bird with

909
00:48:20,087 --> 00:48:25,015
the red breast flying to them, and heactually alighted on the big clod of earth

910
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:26,075
quite near to the gardener's foot.

911
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:30,079
"Here he is," chuckled the old man, andthen he spoke to the bird as if he were

912
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,027
speaking to a child."Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little

913
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:34,009
beggar?" he said.

914
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:39,005
"I've not seen thee before today.Has tha, begun tha' courtin' this early in

915
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:40,035
th' season?Tha'rt too forrad."

916
00:48:40,035 --> 00:48:45,044
The bird put his tiny head on one side andlooked up at him with his soft bright eye

917
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:49,071
which was like a black dewdrop.He seemed quite familiar and not the least

918
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:50,071
afraid.

919
00:48:50,071 --> 00:48:54,054
He hopped about and pecked the earthbriskly, looking for seeds and insects.

920
00:48:54,054 --> 00:48:59,033
It actually gave Mary a queer feeling inher heart, because he was so pretty and

921
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:02,013
cheerful and seemed so like a person.

922
00:49:02,013 --> 00:49:05,059
He had a tiny plump body and a delicatebeak, and slender delicate legs.

923
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:10,057
"Will he always come when you call him?"she asked almost in a whisper.

924
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:12,035
"Aye, that he will.

925
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,056
I've knowed him ever since he was afledgling.

926
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:18,004
He come out of th' nest in th' other gardenan' when first he flew over th' wall he was

927
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:21,013
too weak to fly back for a few days an' wegot friendly.

928
00:49:21,013 --> 00:49:24,038
When he went over th' wall again th' restof th' brood was gone an' he was lonely an'

929
00:49:24,038 --> 00:49:27,029
he come back to me.""What kind of a bird is he?"

930
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,032
Mary asked.

931
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,098
"Doesn't tha' know?He's a robin redbreast an' they're th'

932
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:35,039
friendliest, curiousest birds alive.They're almost as friendly as dogs--if you

933
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,079
know how to get on with 'em.

934
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,083
Watch him peckin' about there an' lookin'round at us now an' again.

935
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:43,078
He knows we're talkin' about him."It was the queerest thing in the world to

936
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:44,082
see the old fellow.

937
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:48,019
He looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud

938
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:51,026
and fond of him."He's a conceited one," he chuckled.

939
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:53,039
"He likes to hear folk talk about him.

940
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,081
An' curious--bless me, there never was hislike for curiosity an' meddlin'.

941
00:49:57,081 --> 00:50:00,001
He's always comin' to see what I'mplantin'.

942
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:03,007
He knows all th' things Mester Craven nevertroubles hissel' to find out.

943
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:05,075
He's th' head gardener, he is."

944
00:50:05,075 --> 00:50:10,022
The robin hopped about busily pecking thesoil and now and then stopped and looked at

945
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:12,065
them a little.Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed

946
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:14,026
at her with great curiosity.

947
00:50:14,026 --> 00:50:17,072
It really seemed as if he were finding outall about her.

948
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:21,099
The queer feeling in her heart increased."Where did the rest of the brood fly to?"

949
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,068
she asked.

950
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:25,045
"There's no knowin'.The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an'

951
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:28,039
make 'em fly an' they're scattered beforeyou know it.

952
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:31,086
This one was a knowin' one an' he knew hewas lonely."

953
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:35,053
Mistress Mary went a step nearer to therobin and looked at him very hard.

954
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:37,056
"I'm lonely," she said.

955
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:42,001
She had not known before that this was oneof the things which made her feel sour and

956
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:43,093
cross.She seemed to find it out when the robin

957
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:47,006
looked at her and she looked at the robin.

958
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:51,056
The old gardener pushed his cap back on hisbald head and stared at her a minute.

959
00:50:51,056 --> 00:50:54,002
"Art tha' th' little wench from India?" heasked.

960
00:50:54,002 --> 00:50:55,006
Mary nodded.

961
00:50:55,006 --> 00:50:58,067
"Then no wonder tha'rt lonely.Tha'lt be lonlier before tha's done," he

962
00:50:58,067 --> 00:50:59,093
said.

963
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:04,061
He began to dig again, driving his spadedeep into the rich black garden soil while

964
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,008
the robin hopped about very busilyemployed.

965
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:08,002
"What is your name?"

966
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:10,079
Mary inquired.He stood up to answer her.

967
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,027
"Ben Weatherstaff," he answered, and thenhe added with a surly chuckle, "I'm lonely

968
00:51:15,027 --> 00:51:19,007
mysel' except when he's with me," and hejerked his thumb toward the robin.

969
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:20,008
"He's th' only friend I've got."

970
00:51:20,008 --> 00:51:24,015
"I have no friends at all," said Mary."I never had.

971
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:26,037
My Ayah didn't like me and I never playedwith any one."

972
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:31,054
It is a Yorkshire habit to say what youthink with blunt frankness, and old Ben

973
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:35,091
Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man."Tha' an' me are a good bit alike," he

974
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,034
said.

975
00:51:36,034 --> 00:51:40,022
"We was wove out of th' same cloth.We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're

976
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:43,082
both of us as sour as we look.We've got the same nasty tempers, both of

977
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:45,015
us, I'll warrant."

978
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:49,011
This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennoxhad never heard the truth about herself in

979
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,073
her life.Native servants always salaamed and

980
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:53,071
submitted to you, whatever you did.

981
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:57,032
She had never thought much about her looks,but she wondered if she was as unattractive

982
00:51:57,032 --> 00:52:01,082
as Ben Weatherstaff and she also wonderedif she looked as sour as he had looked

983
00:52:01,082 --> 00:52:03,012
before the robin came.

984
00:52:03,012 --> 00:52:07,026
She actually began to wonder also if shewas "nasty tempered."

985
00:52:07,026 --> 00:52:11,007
She felt uncomfortable.Suddenly a clear rippling little sound

986
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:14,012
broke out near her and she turned round.

987
00:52:14,012 --> 00:52:17,069
She was standing a few feet from a youngapple-tree and the robin had flown on to

988
00:52:17,069 --> 00:52:20,099
one of its branches and had burst out intoa scrap of a song.

989
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,019
Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.

990
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:27,003
"What did he do that for?" asked Mary."He's made up his mind to make friends with

991
00:52:27,003 --> 00:52:30,007
thee," replied Ben."Dang me if he hasn't took a fancy to

992
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:30,082
thee."

993
00:52:30,082 --> 00:52:36,002
"To me?" said Mary, and she moved towardthe little tree softly and looked up.

994
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:39,044
"Would you make friends with me?" she saidto the robin just as if she was speaking to

995
00:52:39,044 --> 00:52:40,003
a person.

996
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:41,004
"Would you?"

997
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:45,019
And she did not say it either in her hardlittle voice or in her imperious Indian

998
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:50,019
voice, but in a tone so soft and eager andcoaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as

999
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:53,026
surprised as she had been when she heardhim whistle.

1000
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:57,091
"Why," he cried out, "tha' said that asnice an' human as if tha' was a real child

1001
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,063
instead of a sharp old woman.

1002
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:02,002
Tha' said it almost like Dickon talks tohis wild things on th' moor."

1003
00:53:02,002 --> 00:53:05,026
"Do you know Dickon?"Mary asked, turning round rather in a

1004
00:53:05,026 --> 00:53:06,097
hurry.

1005
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:09,052
"Everybody knows him.Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere.

1006
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,063
Th' very blackberries an' heather-bellsknows him.

1007
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,051
I warrant th' foxes shows him where theircubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide

1008
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:19,004
their nests from him."Mary would have liked to ask some more

1009
00:53:19,004 --> 00:53:20,044
questions.

1010
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:23,009
She was almost as curious about Dickon asshe was about the deserted garden.

1011
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:27,088
But just that moment the robin, who hadended his song, gave a little shake of his

1012
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:30,001
wings, spread them and flew away.

1013
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,064
He had made his visit and had other thingsto do.

1014
00:53:32,064 --> 00:53:35,065
"He has flown over the wall!"Mary cried out, watching him.

1015
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:38,007
"He has flown into the orchard--he hasflown across the other wall--into the

1016
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,077
garden where there is no door!""He lives there," said old Ben.

1017
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:43,052
"He came out o' th' egg there.

1018
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:48,002
If he's courtin', he's makin' up to someyoung madam of a robin that lives among th'

1019
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:51,000
old rose-trees there.""Rose-trees," said Mary.

1020
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,049
"Are there rose-trees?"

1021
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:55,001
Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade againand began to dig.

1022
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:59,051
"There was ten year' ago," he mumbled."I should like to see them," said Mary.

1023
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:00,092
"Where is the green door?

1024
00:54:00,092 --> 00:54:05,082
There must be a door somewhere."Ben drove his spade deep and looked as

1025
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:08,074
uncompanionable as he had looked when shefirst saw him.

1026
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:11,061
"There was ten year' ago, but there isn'tnow," he said.

1027
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:14,083
"No door!" cried Mary."There must be."

1028
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:18,013
"None as any one can find, an' none as isany one's business.

1029
00:54:18,013 --> 00:54:21,013
Don't you be a meddlesome wench an' pokeyour nose where it's no cause to go.

1030
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:23,039
Here, I must go on with my work.

1031
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:25,083
Get you gone an' play you.I've no more time."

1032
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:29,015
And he actually stopped digging, threw hisspade over his shoulder and walked off,

1033
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:35,025
without even glancing at her or sayinggood-by.

1034
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,025

CHAPTER VTHE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR

1036
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:49,002
At first each day which passed by for MaryLennox was exactly like the others.

1037
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:52,084
Every morning she awoke in her tapestriedroom and found Martha kneeling upon the

1038
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:57,021
hearth building her fire; every morning sheate her breakfast in the nursery which had

1039
00:54:57,021 --> 00:54:59,034
nothing amusing in it; and after each

1040
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:03,038
breakfast she gazed out of the windowacross to the huge moor which seemed to

1041
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:08,109
spread out on all sides and climb up to thesky, and after she had stared for a while

1042
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:10,129
she realized that if she did not go out she

1043
00:55:10,129 --> 00:55:13,879
would have to stay in and do nothing--andso she went out.

1044
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:17,025
She did not know that this was the bestthing she could have done, and she did not

1045
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:21,589
know that, when she began to walk quicklyor even run along the paths and down the

1046
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:24,008
avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and

1047
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:28,028
making herself stronger by fighting withthe wind which swept down from the moor.

1048
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:33,028
She ran only to make herself warm, and shehated the wind which rushed at her face and

1049
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:37,022
roared and held her back as if it were somegiant she could not see.

1050
00:55:37,022 --> 00:55:41,005
But the big breaths of rough fresh airblown over the heather filled her lungs

1051
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:46,011
with something which was good for her wholethin body and whipped some red color into

1052
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:49,053
her cheeks and brightened her dull eyeswhen she did not know anything about it.

1053
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:54,056
But after a few days spent almost entirelyout of doors she wakened one morning

1054
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:58,004
knowing what it was to be hungry, and whenshe sat down to her breakfast she did not

1055
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:00,009
glance disdainfully at her porridge and

1056
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:04,018
push it away, but took up her spoon andbegan to eat it and went on eating it until

1057
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:07,014
her bowl was empty."Tha' got on well enough with that this

1058
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,022
mornin', didn't tha'?" said Martha.

1059
00:56:09,022 --> 00:56:12,077
"It tastes nice today," said Mary, feelinga little surprised her self.

1060
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:16,003
"It's th' air of th' moor that's givin'thee stomach for tha' victuals," answered

1061
00:56:16,003 --> 00:56:16,051
Martha.

1062
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:19,059
"It's lucky for thee that tha's gotvictuals as well as appetite.

1063
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:23,035
There's been twelve in our cottage as hadth' stomach an' nothin' to put in it.

1064
00:56:23,035 --> 00:56:26,053
You go on playin' you out o' doors everyday an' you'll get some flesh on your bones

1065
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:29,549
an' you won't be so yeller.""I don't play," said Mary.

1066
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:31,027
"I have nothing to play with."

1067
00:56:31,027 --> 00:56:36,042
"Nothin' to play with!" exclaimed Martha."Our children plays with sticks and stones.

1068
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:39,059
They just runs about an' shouts an' looksat things."

1069
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:41,081
Mary did not shout, but she looked atthings.

1070
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:45,599
There was nothing else to do.She walked round and round the gardens and

1071
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,064
wandered about the paths in the park.

1072
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:51,043
Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff,but though several times she saw him at

1073
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:54,009
work he was too busy to look at her or wastoo surly.

1074
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:57,999
Once when she was walking toward him hepicked up his spade and turned away as if

1075
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:01,939
he did it on purpose.One place she went to oftener than to any

1076
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:02,065
other.

1077
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:06,002
It was the long walk outside the gardenswith the walls round them.

1078
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:10,249
There were bare flower-beds on either sideof it and against the walls ivy grew

1079
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:11,004
thickly.

1080
00:57:11,004 --> 00:57:15,519
There was one part of the wall where thecreeping dark green leaves were more bushy

1081
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,719
than elsewhere.It seemed as if for a long time that part

1082
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:20,069
had been neglected.

1083
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:23,889
The rest of it had been clipped and made tolook neat, but at this lower end of the

1084
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:26,012
walk it had not been trimmed at all.

1085
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:30,029
A few days after she had talked to BenWeatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this

1086
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,049
and wondered why it was so.

1087
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:36,459
She had just paused and was looking up at along spray of ivy swinging in the wind when

1088
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:40,569
she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard abrilliant chirp, and there, on the top of

1089
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:42,189
the wall, forward perched Ben

1090
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:46,079
Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tiltingforward to look at her with his small head

1091
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,093
on one side."Oh!" she cried out, "is it you--is it

1092
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:50,099
you?"

1093
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,799
And it did not seem at all queer to herthat she spoke to him as if she were sure

1094
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:56,098
that he would understand and answer her.He did answer.

1095
00:57:56,098 --> 00:58:00,018
He twittered and chirped and hopped alongthe wall as if he were telling her all

1096
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,569
sorts of things.

1097
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:04,809
It seemed to Mistress Mary as if sheunderstood him, too, though he was not

1098
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:07,059
speaking in words.It was as if he said:

1099
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:07,034
"Good morning!

1100
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:10,319
Isn't the wind nice?Isn't the sun nice?

1101
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,279
Isn't everything nice?Let us both chirp and hop and twitter.

1102
00:58:13,279 --> 00:58:14,139
Come on!

1103
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:17,189
Come on!"Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and

1104
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:19,739
took little flights along the wall she ranafter him.

1105
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:25,023
Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary--sheactually looked almost pretty for a moment.

1106
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:26,279
"I like you!

1107
00:58:26,279 --> 00:58:30,087
I like you!" she cried out, pattering downthe walk; and she chirped and tried to

1108
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:34,129
whistle, which last she did not know how todo in the least.

1109
00:58:34,129 --> 00:58:38,001
But the robin seemed to be quite satisfiedand chirped and whistled back at her.

1110
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:41,709
At last he spread his wings and made adarting flight to the top of a tree, where

1111
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:44,018
he perched and sang loudly.

1112
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:46,087
That reminded Mary of the first time shehad seen him.

1113
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:50,079
He had been swinging on a tree-top then andshe had been standing in the orchard.

1114
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,035
Now she was on the other side of theorchard and standing in the path outside a

1115
00:58:54,035 --> 00:58:57,659
wall--much lower down--and there was thesame tree inside.

1116
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,099
"It's in the garden no one can go into,"she said to herself.

1117
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:03,659
"It's the garden without a door.He lives in there.

1118
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:06,077
How I wish I could see what it is like!"

1119
00:59:06,077 --> 00:59:10,003
She ran up the walk to the green door shehad entered the first morning.

1120
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:13,789
Then she ran down the path through theother door and then into the orchard, and

1121
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:17,259
when she stood and looked up there was thetree on the other side of the wall, and

1122
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:19,011
there was the robin just finishing his song

1123
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:21,289
and, beginning to preen his feathers withhis beak.

1124
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:25,319
"It is the garden," she said."I am sure it is."

1125
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,949
She walked round and looked closely at thatside of the orchard wall, but she only

1126
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:32,043
found what she had found before--that therewas no door in it.

1127
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:35,059
Then she ran through the kitchen-gardensagain and out into the walk outside the

1128
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:39,759
long ivy-covered wall, and she walked tothe end of it and looked at it, but there

1129
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:42,002
was no door; and then she walked to the

1130
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:44,049
other end, looking again, but there was nodoor.

1131
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:49,729
"It's very queer," she said."Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door

1132
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:50,046
and there is no door.

1133
00:59:50,046 --> 00:59:55,479
But there must have been one ten years ago,because Mr. Craven buried the key."

1134
00:59:55,479 --> 00:59:58,879
This gave her so much to think of that shebegan to be quite interested and feel that

1135
00:59:58,879 --> 01:00:01,096
she was not sorry that she had come toMisselthwaite Manor.

1136
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:06,006
In India she had always felt hot and toolanguid to care much about anything.

1137
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:09,919
The fact was that the fresh wind from themoor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of

1138
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:13,025
her young brain and to waken her up alittle.

1139
01:00:13,025 --> 01:00:17,028
She stayed out of doors nearly all day, andwhen she sat down to her supper at night

1140
01:00:17,028 --> 01:00:21,058
she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable.She did not feel cross when Martha

1141
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:22,071
chattered away.

1142
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:26,024
She felt as if she rather liked to hearher, and at last she thought she would ask

1143
01:00:26,024 --> 01:00:27,024
her a question.

1144
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:30,059
She asked it after she had finished hersupper and had sat down on the hearth-rug

1145
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,003
before the fire."Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?" she

1146
01:00:34,003 --> 01:00:35,129
said.

1147
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:38,639
She had made Martha stay with her andMartha had not objected at all.

1148
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,689
She was very young, and used to a crowdedcottage full of brothers and sisters, and

1149
01:00:42,689 --> 01:00:45,099
she found it dull in the great servants'hall downstairs where the footman and

1150
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,081
upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire

1151
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:51,081
speech and looked upon her as a commonlittle thing, and sat and whispered among

1152
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,068
themselves.

1153
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:57,005
Martha liked to talk, and the strange childwho had lived in India, and been waited

1154
01:00:57,005 --> 01:01:00,639
upon by "blacks," was novelty enough toattract her.

1155
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,049
She sat down on the hearth herself withoutwaiting to be asked.

1156
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:06,037
"Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?"she said.

1157
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,033
"I knew tha' would.

1158
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:09,093
That was just the way with me when I firstheard about it."

1159
01:01:09,093 --> 01:01:13,069
"Why did he hate it?"Mary persisted.

1160
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:16,319
Martha tucked her feet under her and madeherself quite comfortable.

1161
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,979
"Listen to th' wind wutherin' round thehouse," she said.

1162
01:01:19,979 --> 01:01:23,539
"You could bare stand up on the moor if youwas out on it tonight."

1163
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:27,219
Mary did not know what "wutherin'" meantuntil she listened, and then she

1164
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:28,509
understood.

1165
01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:32,053
It must mean that hollow shuddering sort ofroar which rushed round and round the house

1166
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:36,249
as if the giant no one could see werebuffeting it and beating at the walls and

1167
01:01:36,249 --> 01:01:38,129
windows to try to break in.

1168
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:41,909
But one knew he could not get in, andsomehow it made one feel very safe and warm

1169
01:01:41,909 --> 01:01:46,349
inside a room with a red coal fire."But why did he hate it so?" she asked,

1170
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:47,074
after she had listened.

1171
01:01:47,074 --> 01:01:52,729
She intended to know if Martha did.Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.

1172
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:55,086
"Mind," she said, "Mrs. Medlock said it'snot to be talked about.

1173
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,058
There's lots o' things in this place that'snot to be talked over.

1174
01:01:58,058 --> 01:02:02,053
That's Mr. Craven's orders.His troubles are none servants' business,

1175
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:03,043
he says.

1176
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:05,979
But for th' garden he wouldn't be like heis.

1177
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:09,479
It was Mrs. Craven's garden that she hadmade when first they were married an' she

1178
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:12,729
just loved it, an' they used to 'tend theflowers themselves.

1179
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,349
An' none o' th' gardeners was ever let togo in.

1180
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:20,499
Him an' her used to go in an' shut th' dooran' stay there hours an' hours, readin' and

1181
01:02:20,499 --> 01:02:20,499
talkin'.

1182
01:02:20,499 --> 01:02:23,084
An' she was just a bit of a girl an' therewas an old tree with a branch bent like a

1183
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:26,008
seat on it.An' she made roses grow over it an' she

1184
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,949
used to sit there.

1185
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:31,979
But one day when she was sittin' there th'branch broke an' she fell on th' ground an'

1186
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:36,639
was hurt so bad that next day she died.Th' doctors thought he'd go out o' his mind

1187
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:37,074
an' die, too.

1188
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:41,219
That's why he hates it.No one's never gone in since, an' he won't

1189
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:45,096
let any one talk about it."Mary did not ask any more questions.

1190
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:49,379
She looked at the red fire and listened tothe wind "wutherin'."

1191
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:52,058
It seemed to be "wutherin'" louder thanever.

1192
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:55,099
At that moment a very good thing washappening to her.

1193
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:58,229
Four good things had happened to her, infact, since she came to Misselthwaite

1194
01:02:58,229 --> 01:02:59,259
Manor.

1195
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:03,069
She had felt as if she had understood arobin and that he had understood her; she

1196
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:07,199
had run in the wind until her blood hadgrown warm; she had been healthily hungry

1197
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,062
for the first time in her life; and she had

1198
01:03:09,062 --> 01:03:11,095
found out what it was to be sorry for someone.

1199
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:16,077
But as she was listening to the wind shebegan to listen to something else.

1200
01:03:16,077 --> 01:03:20,007
She did not know what it was, because atfirst she could scarcely distinguish it

1201
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:23,091
from the wind itself.It was a curious sound--it seemed almost as

1202
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,026
if a child were crying somewhere.

1203
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:30,006
Sometimes the wind sounded rather like achild crying, but presently Mistress Mary

1204
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:33,052
felt quite sure this sound was inside thehouse, not outside it.

1205
01:03:33,052 --> 01:03:36,075
It was far away, but it was inside.

1206
01:03:36,075 --> 01:03:41,001
She turned round and looked at Martha."Do you hear any one crying?" she said.

1207
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:44,042
Martha suddenly looked confused."No," she answered.

1208
01:03:44,042 --> 01:03:45,096
"It's th' wind.

1209
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:48,083
Sometimes it sounds like as if some one waslost on th' moor an' wailin'.

1210
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:52,002
It's got all sorts o' sounds.""But listen," said Mary.

1211
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:56,004
"It's in the house--down one of those longcorridors."

1212
01:03:56,004 --> 01:03:59,073
And at that very moment a door must havebeen opened somewhere downstairs; for a

1213
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:03,058
great rushing draft blew along the passageand the door of the room they sat in was

1214
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:05,089
blown open with a crash, and as they both

1215
01:04:05,089 --> 01:04:09,058
jumped to their feet the light was blownout and the crying sound was swept down the

1216
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:13,007
far corridor so that it was to be heardmore plainly than ever.

1217
01:04:13,007 --> 01:04:14,014
"There!" said Mary.

1218
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:17,081
"I told you so!It is some one crying--and it isn't a

1219
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:18,061
grown-up person."

1220
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:22,078
Martha ran and shut the door and turned thekey, but before she did it they both heard

1221
01:04:22,078 --> 01:04:26,007
the sound of a door in some far passageshutting with a bang, and then everything

1222
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:30,007
was quiet, for even the wind ceased"wutherin'" for a few moments.

1223
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:34,046
"It was th' wind," said Martha stubbornly."An' if it wasn't, it was little Betty

1224
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:36,002
Butterworth, th' scullery-maid.

1225
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:40,036
She's had th' toothache all day."But something troubled and awkward in her

1226
01:04:40,036 --> 01:04:43,024
manner made Mistress Mary stare very hardat her.

1227
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:50,005
She did not believe she was speaking thetruth.

1228
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:51,005
>

1229
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:58,096
CHAPTER VI"THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING--THERE WAS!"

1230
01:04:58,096 --> 01:05:03,093
The next day the rain poured down intorrents again, and when Mary looked out of

1231
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:07,639
her window the moor was almost hidden bygray mist and cloud.

1232
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:09,789
There could be no going out today.

1233
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:14,018
"What do you do in your cottage when itrains like this?" she asked Martha.

1234
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:18,359
"Try to keep from under each other's feetmostly," Martha answered.

1235
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:20,006
"Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.

1236
01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:24,002
Mother's a good-tempered woman but she getsfair moithered.

1237
01:05:24,002 --> 01:05:26,899
The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shedand plays there.

1238
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:28,053
Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet.

1239
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:30,949
He goes out just th' same as if th' sun wasshinin'.

1240
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:34,809
He says he sees things on rainy days asdoesn't show when it's fair weather.

1241
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:38,719
He once found a little fox cub half drownedin its hole and he brought it home in th'

1242
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:40,519
bosom of his shirt to keep it warm.

1243
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:44,129
Its mother had been killed nearby an' th'hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th'

1244
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:46,639
litter was dead.He's got it at home now.

1245
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,519
He found a half-drowned young crow anothertime an' he brought it home, too, an' tamed

1246
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:51,139
it.

1247
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:54,579
It's named Soot because it's so black, an'it hops an' flies about with him

1248
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:58,018
everywhere."The time had come when Mary had forgotten

1249
01:05:58,018 --> 01:06:00,005
to resent Martha's familiar talk.

1250
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:04,003
She had even begun to find it interestingand to be sorry when she stopped or went

1251
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,008
away.

1252
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:08,073
The stories she had been told by her Ayahwhen she lived in India had been quite

1253
01:06:08,073 --> 01:06:12,081
unlike those Martha had to tell about themoorland cottage which held fourteen people

1254
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:16,078
who lived in four little rooms and neverhad quite enough to eat.

1255
01:06:16,078 --> 01:06:20,062
The children seemed to tumble about andamuse themselves like a litter of rough,

1256
01:06:20,062 --> 01:06:22,068
good-natured collie puppies.

1257
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:25,042
Mary was most attracted by the mother andDickon.

1258
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:29,031
When Martha told stories of what "mother"said or did they always sounded

1259
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:30,008
comfortable.

1260
01:06:30,008 --> 01:06:33,084
"If I had a raven or a fox cub I could playwith it," said Mary.

1261
01:06:33,084 --> 01:06:36,063
"But I have nothing."Martha looked perplexed.

1262
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:39,017
"Can tha' knit?" she asked.

1263
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:42,025
"No," answered Mary."Can tha' sew?"

1264
01:06:42,025 --> 01:06:44,031
"No.""Can tha' read?"

1265
01:06:44,031 --> 01:06:45,028
"Yes."

1266
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:48,062
"Then why doesn't tha, read somethin', orlearn a bit o' spellin'?

1267
01:06:48,062 --> 01:06:51,031
Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book agood bit now."

1268
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:52,096
"I haven't any books," said Mary.

1269
01:06:52,096 --> 01:06:56,088
"Those I had were left in India.""That's a pity," said Martha.

1270
01:06:56,088 --> 01:07:01,249
"If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th'library, there's thousands o' books there."

1271
01:07:01,249 --> 01:07:05,769
Mary did not ask where the library was,because she was suddenly inspired by a new

1272
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,629
idea.She made up her mind to go and find it

1273
01:07:08,629 --> 01:07:09,031
herself.

1274
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:12,859
She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock.Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her

1275
01:07:12,859 --> 01:07:15,073
comfortable housekeeper's sitting-roomdownstairs.

1276
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:19,319
In this queer place one scarcely ever sawany one at all.

1277
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:23,009
In fact, there was no one to see but theservants, and when their master was away

1278
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:27,269
they lived a luxurious life below stairs,where there was a huge kitchen hung about

1279
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:29,499
with shining brass and pewter, and a large

1280
01:07:29,499 --> 01:07:33,519
servants' hall where there were four orfive abundant meals eaten every day, and

1281
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:37,569
where a great deal of lively romping wenton when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.

1282
01:07:37,569 --> 01:07:42,099
Mary's meals were served regularly, andMartha waited on her, but no one troubled

1283
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,084
themselves about her in the least.

1284
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:47,769
Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her everyday or two, but no one inquired what she

1285
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:51,239
did or told her what to do.She supposed that perhaps this was the

1286
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:53,069
English way of treating children.

1287
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,749
In India she had always been attended byher Ayah, who had followed her about and

1288
01:07:56,749 --> 01:08:01,079
waited on her, hand and foot.She had often been tired of her company.

1289
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:04,098
Now she was followed by nobody and waslearning to dress herself because Martha

1290
01:08:04,098 --> 01:08:08,349
looked as though she thought she was sillyand stupid when she wanted to have things

1291
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:10,499
handed to her and put on.

1292
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:13,095
"Hasn't tha' got good sense?" she saidonce, when Mary had stood waiting for her

1293
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:17,809
to put on her gloves for her."Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee

1294
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:19,095
an' she's only four year' old.

1295
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,069
Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th'head."

1296
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:26,095
Mary had worn her contrary scowl for anhour after that, but it made her think

1297
01:08:26,095 --> 01:08:29,709
several entirely new things.

1298
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:32,909
She stood at the window for about tenminutes this morning after Martha had swept

1299
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:36,059
up the hearth for the last time and gonedownstairs.

1300
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:39,669
She was thinking over the new idea whichhad come to her when she heard of the

1301
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:40,069
library.

1302
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:43,639
She did not care very much about thelibrary itself, because she had read very

1303
01:08:43,639 --> 01:08:48,999
few books; but to hear of it brought backto her mind the hundred rooms with closed

1304
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:49,519
doors.

1305
01:08:49,519 --> 01:08:53,069
She wondered if they were all really lockedand what she would find if she could get

1306
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:56,269
into any of them.Were there a hundred really?

1307
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:58,829
Why shouldn't she go and see how many doorsshe could count?

1308
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:02,389
It would be something to do on this morningwhen she could not go out.

1309
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,098
She had never been taught to ask permissionto do things, and she knew nothing at all

1310
01:09:05,098 --> 01:09:09,042
about authority, so she would not havethought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if

1311
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:13,028
she might walk about the house, even if shehad seen her.

1312
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:17,009
She opened the door of the room and wentinto the corridor, and then she began her

1313
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:17,081
wanderings.

1314
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:21,079
It was a long corridor and it branched intoother corridors and it led her up short

1315
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:23,098
flights of steps which mounted to othersagain.

1316
01:09:23,098 --> 01:09:28,007
There were doors and doors, and there werepictures on the walls.

1317
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:32,055
Sometimes they were pictures of dark,curious landscapes, but oftenest they were

1318
01:09:32,055 --> 01:09:38,029
portraits of men and women in queer, grandcostumes made of satin and velvet.

1319
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:43,014
She found herself in one long gallery whosewalls were covered with these portraits.

1320
01:09:43,014 --> 01:09:46,035
She had never thought there could be somany in any house.

1321
01:09:46,035 --> 01:09:50,015
She walked slowly down this place andstared at the faces which also seemed to

1322
01:09:50,015 --> 01:09:51,065
stare at her.

1323
01:09:51,065 --> 01:09:55,016
She felt as if they were wondering what alittle girl from India was doing in their

1324
01:09:55,016 --> 01:09:55,058
house.

1325
01:09:55,058 --> 01:10:00,005
Some were pictures of children--littlegirls in thick satin frocks which reached

1326
01:10:00,005 --> 01:10:04,008
to their feet and stood out about them, andboys with puffed sleeves and lace collars

1327
01:10:04,008 --> 01:10:08,038
and long hair, or with big ruffs aroundtheir necks.

1328
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:12,004
She always stopped to look at the children,and wonder what their names were, and where

1329
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:14,088
they had gone, and why they wore such oddclothes.

1330
01:10:14,088 --> 01:10:18,032
There was a stiff, plain little girl ratherlike herself.

1331
01:10:18,032 --> 01:10:21,086
She wore a green brocade dress and held agreen parrot on her finger.

1332
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:24,037
Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.

1333
01:10:24,037 --> 01:10:27,051
"Where do you live now?" said Mary aloud toher.

1334
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:31,076
"I wish you were here."Surely no other little girl ever spent such

1335
01:10:31,076 --> 01:10:32,088
a queer morning.

1336
01:10:32,088 --> 01:10:37,067
It seemed as if there was no one in all thehuge rambling house but her own small self,

1337
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:42,004
wandering about upstairs and down, throughnarrow passages and wide ones, where it

1338
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:45,022
seemed to her that no one but herself hadever walked.

1339
01:10:45,022 --> 01:10:49,051
Since so many rooms had been built, peoplemust have lived in them, but it all seemed

1340
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:53,033
so empty that she could not quite believeit true.

1341
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:57,003
It was not until she climbed to the secondfloor that she thought of turning the

1342
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,043
handle of a door.

1343
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:01,067
All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlockhad said they were, but at last she put her

1344
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:04,018
hand on the handle of one of them andturned it.

1345
01:11:04,018 --> 01:11:08,017
She was almost frightened for a moment whenshe felt that it turned without difficulty

1346
01:11:08,017 --> 01:11:12,062
and that when she pushed upon the dooritself it slowly and heavily opened.

1347
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:16,018
It was a massive door and opened into a bigbedroom.

1348
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:19,096
There were embroidered hangings on thewall, and inlaid furniture such as she had

1349
01:11:19,096 --> 01:11:21,093
seen in India stood about the room.

1350
01:11:21,093 --> 01:11:26,067
A broad window with leaded panes looked outupon the moor; and over the mantel was

1351
01:11:26,067 --> 01:11:30,039
another portrait of the stiff, plain littlegirl who seemed to stare at her more

1352
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:31,071
curiously than ever.

1353
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:36,021
"Perhaps she slept here once," said Mary."She stares at me so that she makes me feel

1354
01:11:36,021 --> 01:11:40,004
queer."After that she opened more doors and more.

1355
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:44,059
She saw so many rooms that she became quitetired and began to think that there must be

1356
01:11:44,059 --> 01:11:47,044
a hundred, though she had not counted them.

1357
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:51,054
In all of them there were old pictures orold tapestries with strange scenes worked

1358
01:11:51,054 --> 01:11:54,076
on them.There were curious pieces of furniture and

1359
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:57,003
curious ornaments in nearly all of them.

1360
01:11:57,003 --> 01:12:00,065
In one room, which looked like a lady'ssitting-room, the hangings were all

1361
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:05,011
embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet wereabout a hundred little elephants made of

1362
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:05,091
ivory.

1363
01:12:05,091 --> 01:12:10,091
They were of different sizes, and some hadtheir mahouts or palanquins on their backs.

1364
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:14,061
Some were much bigger than the others andsome were so tiny that they seemed only

1365
01:12:14,061 --> 01:12:15,088
babies.

1366
01:12:15,088 --> 01:12:20,003
Mary had seen carved ivory in India and sheknew all about elephants.

1367
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,095
She opened the door of the cabinet andstood on a footstool and played with these

1368
01:12:22,095 --> 01:12:24,052
for quite a long time.

1369
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:29,022
When she got tired she set the elephants inorder and shut the door of the cabinet.

1370
01:12:29,022 --> 01:12:32,067
In all her wanderings through the longcorridors and the empty rooms, she had seen

1371
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:35,085
nothing alive; but in this room she sawsomething.

1372
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:40,001
Just after she had closed the cabinet doorshe heard a tiny rustling sound.

1373
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:43,055
It made her jump and look around at thesofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed

1374
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:44,058
to come.

1375
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:48,076
In the corner of the sofa there was acushion, and in the velvet which covered it

1376
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:53,015
there was a hole, and out of the holepeeped a tiny head with a pair of

1377
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:55,001
frightened eyes in it.

1378
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:59,082
Mary crept softly across the room to look.The bright eyes belonged to a little gray

1379
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:03,062
mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole intothe cushion and made a comfortable nest

1380
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:04,047
there.

1381
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,047
Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep nearher.

1382
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:11,002
If there was no one else alive in thehundred rooms there were seven mice who did

1383
01:13:11,002 --> 01:13:13,005
not look lonely at all.

1384
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:17,074
"If they wouldn't be so frightened I wouldtake them back with me," said Mary.

1385
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:21,037
She had wandered about long enough to feeltoo tired to wander any farther, and she

1386
01:13:21,037 --> 01:13:22,021
turned back.

1387
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:26,003
Two or three times she lost her way byturning down the wrong corridor and was

1388
01:13:26,003 --> 01:13:30,007
obliged to ramble up and down until shefound the right one; but at last she

1389
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:31,009
reached her own floor again, though she was

1390
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:35,007
some distance from her own room and did notknow exactly where she was.

1391
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:39,039
"I believe I have taken a wrong turningagain," she said, standing still at what

1392
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,037
seemed the end of a short passage withtapestry on the wall.

1393
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:43,041
"I don't know which way to go.

1394
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:48,011
How still everything is!"It was while she was standing here and just

1395
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:51,074
after she had said this that the stillnesswas broken by a sound.

1396
01:13:51,074 --> 01:13:56,021
It was another cry, but not quite like theone she had heard last night; it was only a

1397
01:13:56,021 --> 01:14:00,052
short one, a fretful childish whine muffledby passing through walls.

1398
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:04,054
"It's nearer than it was," said Mary, herheart beating rather faster.

1399
01:14:04,054 --> 01:14:07,001
"And it is crying."

1400
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:11,001
She put her hand accidentally upon thetapestry near her, and then sprang back,

1401
01:14:11,001 --> 01:14:12,008
feeling quite startled.

1402
01:14:12,008 --> 01:14:16,007
The tapestry was the covering of a doorwhich fell open and showed her that there

1403
01:14:16,007 --> 01:14:19,099
was another part of the corridor behind it,and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her

1404
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:23,056
bunch of keys in her hand and a very crosslook on her face.

1405
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:27,022
"What are you doing here?" she said, andshe took Mary by the arm and pulled her

1406
01:14:27,022 --> 01:14:27,065
away.

1407
01:14:27,065 --> 01:14:30,064
"What did I tell you?""I turned round the wrong corner,"

1408
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:33,038
explained Mary."I didn't know which way to go and I heard

1409
01:14:33,038 --> 01:14:34,056
some one crying."

1410
01:14:34,056 --> 01:14:38,007
She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment,but she hated her more the next.

1411
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:40,055
"You didn't hear anything of the sort,"said the housekeeper.

1412
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:44,034
"You come along back to your own nursery orI'll box your ears."

1413
01:14:44,034 --> 01:14:47,095
And she took her by the arm and halfpushed, half pulled her up one passage and

1414
01:14:47,095 --> 01:14:51,043
down another until she pushed her in at thedoor of her own room.

1415
01:14:51,043 --> 01:14:55,068
"Now," she said, "you stay where you'retold to stay or you'll find yourself locked

1416
01:14:55,068 --> 01:14:58,029
up.The master had better get you a governess,

1417
01:14:58,029 --> 01:14:59,011
same as he said he would.

1418
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:01,038
You're one that needs some one to looksharp after you.

1419
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,529
I've got enough to do."

1420
01:15:03,529 --> 01:15:07,021
She went out of the room and slammed thedoor after her, and Mary went and sat on

1421
01:15:07,021 --> 01:15:11,063
the hearth-rug, pale with rage.She did not cry, but ground her teeth.

1422
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:16,047
"There was some one crying--there was--there was!" she said to herself.

1423
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:20,032
She had heard it twice now, and sometimeshe would find out.

1424
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:22,049
She had found out a great deal thismorning.

1425
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:25,095
She felt as if she had been on a longjourney, and at any rate she had had

1426
01:15:25,095 --> 01:15:29,049
something to amuse her all the time, andshe had played with the ivory elephants and

1427
01:15:29,049 --> 01:15:38,000
had seen the gray mouse and its babies intheir nest in the velvet cushion.

1428
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
>

1429
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:46,939
CHAPTER VIITHE KEY TO THE GARDEN

1430
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:51,419
Two days after this, when Mary opened hereyes she sat upright in bed immediately,

1431
01:15:51,419 --> 01:15:53,032
and called to Martha."Look at the moor!

1432
01:15:53,032 --> 01:15:55,379
Look at the moor!"

1433
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:59,058
The rainstorm had ended and the gray mistand clouds had been swept away in the night

1434
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:00,089
by the wind.

1435
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:06,006
The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant,deep blue sky arched high over the

1436
01:16:06,006 --> 01:16:10,419
moorland.Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so

1437
01:16:10,419 --> 01:16:10,081
blue.

1438
01:16:10,081 --> 01:16:16,058
In India skies were hot and blazing; thiswas of a deep cool blue which almost seemed

1439
01:16:16,058 --> 01:16:22,015
to sparkle like the waters of some lovelybottomless lake, and here and there, high,

1440
01:16:22,015 --> 01:16:27,019
high in the arched blueness floated smallclouds of snow-white fleece.

1441
01:16:27,019 --> 01:16:31,087
The far-reaching world of the moor itselflooked softly blue instead of gloomy

1442
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,005
purple-black or awful dreary gray.

1443
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:38,019
"Aye," said Martha with a cheerful grin."Th' storm's over for a bit.

1444
01:16:38,019 --> 01:16:40,067
It does like this at this time o' th' year.

1445
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:43,009
It goes off in a night like it waspretendin' it had never been here an' never

1446
01:16:43,009 --> 01:16:47,859
meant to come again.That's because th' springtime's on its way.

1447
01:16:47,859 --> 01:16:50,042
It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'."

1448
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:54,179
"I thought perhaps it always rained orlooked dark in England," Mary said.

1449
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:58,095
"Eh! no!" said Martha, sitting up on herheels among her black lead brushes.

1450
01:16:58,095 --> 01:17:00,059
"Nowt o' th' soart!"

1451
01:17:00,059 --> 01:17:03,042
"What does that mean?" asked Maryseriously.

1452
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:06,679
In India the natives spoke differentdialects which only a few people

1453
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:10,619
understood, so she was not surprised whenMartha used words she did not know.

1454
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:13,369
Martha laughed as she had done the firstmorning.

1455
01:17:13,369 --> 01:17:16,439
"There now," she said."I've talked broad Yorkshire again like

1456
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:18,409
Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't.

1457
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:23,479
'Nowt o' th' soart' means 'nothin'-of-the-sort,'" slowly and carefully, "but it takes

1458
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:27,509
so long to say it.Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth

1459
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:28,859
when it is sunny.

1460
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:31,439
I told thee tha'd like th' moor after abit.

1461
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,031
Just you wait till you see th' gold-coloredgorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th'

1462
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:39,095
broom, an' th' heather flowerin', allpurple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies

1463
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:44,053
flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarkssoarin' up an' singin'.

1464
01:17:44,053 --> 01:17:49,033
You'll want to get out on it as sunrise an'live out on it all day like Dickon does."

1465
01:17:49,033 --> 01:17:53,000
"Could I ever get there?" asked Marywistfully, looking through her window at

1466
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,097
the far-off blue.It was so new and big and wonderful and

1467
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:58,088
such a heavenly color.

1468
01:17:58,088 --> 01:18:02,078
"I don't know," answered Martha."Tha's never used tha' legs since tha' was

1469
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:05,088
born, it seems to me.Tha' couldn't walk five mile.

1470
01:18:05,088 --> 01:18:07,075
It's five mile to our cottage."

1471
01:18:07,075 --> 01:18:12,062
"I should like to see your cottage."Martha stared at her a moment curiously

1472
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:16,047
before she took up her polishing brush andbegan to rub the grate again.

1473
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:20,058
She was thinking that the small plain facedid not look quite as sour at this moment

1474
01:18:20,058 --> 01:18:23,048
as it had done the first morning she sawit.

1475
01:18:23,048 --> 01:18:28,004
It looked just a trifle like little SusanAnn's when she wanted something very much.

1476
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:32,012
"I'll ask my mother about it," she said."She's one o' them that nearly always sees

1477
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:33,059
a way to do things.

1478
01:18:33,059 --> 01:18:35,065
It's my day out today an' I'm goin' home.Eh!

1479
01:18:35,065 --> 01:18:38,045
I am glad.Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother.

1480
01:18:38,045 --> 01:18:40,061
Perhaps she could talk to her."

1481
01:18:40,061 --> 01:18:44,039
"I like your mother," said Mary."I should think tha' did," agreed Martha,

1482
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:47,053
polishing away."I've never seen her," said Mary.

1483
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:50,032
"No, tha' hasn't," replied Martha.

1484
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:53,058
She sat up on her heels again and rubbedthe end of her nose with the back of her

1485
01:18:53,058 --> 01:18:56,073
hand as if puzzled for a moment, but sheended quite positively.

1486
01:18:56,073 --> 01:19:01,098
"Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin'an' goodnatured an' clean that no one could

1487
01:19:01,098 --> 01:19:04,081
help likin' her whether they'd seen her ornot.

1488
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:08,002
When I'm goin' home to her on my day out Ijust jump for joy when I'm crossin' the

1489
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:11,016
moor.""I like Dickon," added Mary.

1490
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:12,008
"And I've never seen him."

1491
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:17,001
"Well," said Martha stoutly, "I've toldthee that th' very birds likes him an' th'

1492
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:20,086
rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th'foxes themselves.

1493
01:19:20,086 --> 01:19:25,078
I wonder," staring at her reflectively,"what Dickon would think of thee?"

1494
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:29,006
"He wouldn't like me," said Mary in herstiff, cold little way.

1495
01:19:29,006 --> 01:19:30,025
"No one does."

1496
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:35,003
Martha looked reflective again."How does tha' like thysel'?" she inquired,

1497
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:38,009
really quite as if she were curious toknow.

1498
01:19:38,009 --> 01:19:40,085
Mary hesitated a moment and thought itover.

1499
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:46,017
"Not at all--really," she answered."But I never thought of that before."

1500
01:19:46,017 --> 01:19:49,061
Martha grinned a little as if at somehomely recollection.

1501
01:19:49,061 --> 01:19:52,029
"Mother said that to me once," she said.

1502
01:19:52,029 --> 01:19:55,094
"She was at her wash-tub an' I was in a badtemper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she

1503
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:59,129
turns round on me an' says: 'Tha' youngvixen, tha'!

1504
01:19:59,129 --> 01:20:03,052
There tha' stands sayin' tha' doesn't likethis one an' tha' doesn't like that one.

1505
01:20:03,052 --> 01:20:07,024
How does tha' like thysel'?'It made me laugh an' it brought me to my

1506
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:09,027
senses in a minute."

1507
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:12,008
She went away in high spirits as soon asshe had given Mary her breakfast.

1508
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:16,599
She was going to walk five miles across themoor to the cottage, and she was going to

1509
01:20:16,599 --> 01:20:22,039
help her mother with the washing and do theweek's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.

1510
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:26,139
Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knewshe was no longer in the house.

1511
01:20:26,139 --> 01:20:29,939
She went out into the garden as quickly aspossible, and the first thing she did was

1512
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:33,074
to run round and round the fountain flowergarden ten times.

1513
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:37,689
She counted the times carefully and whenshe had finished she felt in better

1514
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:40,053
spirits.The sunshine made the whole place look

1515
01:20:40,053 --> 01:20:41,139
different.

1516
01:20:41,139 --> 01:20:45,055
The high, deep, blue sky arched overMisselthwaite as well as over the moor, and

1517
01:20:45,055 --> 01:20:49,479
she kept lifting her face and looking upinto it, trying to imagine what it would be

1518
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:53,096
like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about.

1519
01:20:53,096 --> 01:20:57,096
She went into the first kitchen-garden andfound Ben Weatherstaff working there with

1520
01:20:57,096 --> 01:20:59,068
two other gardeners.

1521
01:20:59,068 --> 01:21:02,199
The change in the weather seemed to havedone him good.

1522
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:05,949
He spoke to her of his own accord."Springtime's comin,'" he said.

1523
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:07,669
"Cannot tha' smell it?"

1524
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:11,689
Mary sniffed and thought she could."I smell something nice and fresh and

1525
01:21:11,689 --> 01:21:15,055
damp," she said."That's th' good rich earth," he answered,

1526
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:16,008
digging away.

1527
01:21:16,008 --> 01:21:19,639
"It's in a good humor makin' ready to growthings.

1528
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:23,819
It's glad when plantin' time comes.It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt

1529
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:24,083
to do.

1530
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:29,029
In th' flower gardens out there things willbe stirrin' down below in th' dark.

1531
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:32,629
Th' sun's warmin' 'em.You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin'

1532
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:34,699
out o' th' black earth after a bit."

1533
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:38,479
"What will they be?" asked Mary."Crocuses an' snowdrops an'

1534
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:41,379
daffydowndillys.Has tha' never seen them?"

1535
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:46,229
"No. Everything is hot, and wet, and greenafter the rains in India," said Mary.

1536
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:49,909
"And I think things grow up in a night.""These won't grow up in a night," said

1537
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:50,419
Weatherstaff.

1538
01:21:50,419 --> 01:21:54,389
"Tha'll have to wait for 'em.They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push

1539
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:58,071
out a spike more there, an' uncurl a leafthis day an' another that.

1540
01:21:58,071 --> 01:21:59,169
You watch 'em."

1541
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:04,409
"I am going to," answered Mary.Very soon she heard the soft rustling

1542
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:08,539
flight of wings again and she knew at oncethat the robin had come again.

1543
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:12,055
He was very pert and lively, and hoppedabout so close to her feet, and put his

1544
01:22:12,055 --> 01:22:17,021
head on one side and looked at her so slylythat she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.

1545
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:19,729
"Do you think he remembers me?" she said.

1546
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:23,129
"Remembers thee!" said Weatherstaffindignantly.

1547
01:22:23,129 --> 01:22:26,849
"He knows every cabbage stump in th'gardens, let alone th' people.

1548
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:30,065
He's never seen a little wench here before,an' he's bent on findin' out all about

1549
01:22:30,065 --> 01:22:33,033
thee.Tha's no need to try to hide anything from

1550
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:33,659
him."

1551
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:38,759
"Are things stirring down below in the darkin that garden where he lives?"

1552
01:22:38,759 --> 01:22:41,349
Mary inquired."What garden?" grunted Weatherstaff,

1553
01:22:41,349 --> 01:22:43,249
becoming surly again.

1554
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:46,819
"The one where the old rose-trees are."She could not help asking, because she

1555
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:50,008
wanted so much to know."Are all the flowers dead, or do some of

1556
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:52,015
them come again in the summer?

1557
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:57,008
Are there ever any roses?""Ask him," said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching

1558
01:22:57,008 --> 01:23:00,027
his shoulders toward the robin."He's the only one as knows.

1559
01:23:00,027 --> 01:23:02,909
No one else has seen inside it for tenyear'."

1560
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:08,065
Ten years was a long time, Mary thought.She had been born ten years ago.

1561
01:23:08,065 --> 01:23:10,068
She walked away, slowly thinking.

1562
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:15,018
She had begun to like the garden just asshe had begun to like the robin and Dickon

1563
01:23:15,018 --> 01:23:18,919
and Martha's mother.She was beginning to like Martha, too.

1564
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:22,087
That seemed a good many people to like--when you were not used to liking.

1565
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:25,729
She thought of the robin as one of thepeople.

1566
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:29,749
She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she could see the

1567
01:23:29,749 --> 01:23:34,021
tree-tops; and the second time she walkedup and down the most interesting and

1568
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:40,199
exciting thing happened to her, and it wasall through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.

1569
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:44,003
She heard a chirp and a twitter, and whenshe looked at the bare flower-bed at her

1570
01:23:44,003 --> 01:23:48,004
left side there he was hopping about andpretending to peck things out of the earth

1571
01:23:48,004 --> 01:23:50,659
to persuade her that he had not followedher.

1572
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:54,999
But she knew he had followed her and thesurprise so filled her with delight that

1573
01:23:54,999 --> 01:23:57,279
she almost trembled a little.

1574
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,119
"You do remember me!" she cried out."You do!

1575
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,021
You are prettier than anything else in theworld!"

1576
01:24:03,021 --> 01:24:08,099
She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and hehopped, and flirted his tail and twittered.

1577
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:09,093
It was as if he were talking.

1578
01:24:09,093 --> 01:24:14,088
His red waistcoat was like satin and hepuffed his tiny breast out and was so fine

1579
01:24:14,088 --> 01:24:18,649
and so grand and so pretty that it wasreally as if he were showing her how

1580
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:22,029
important and like a human person a robincould be.

1581
01:24:22,029 --> 01:24:25,759
Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever beencontrary in her life when he allowed her to

1582
01:24:25,759 --> 01:24:29,779
draw closer and closer to him, and benddown and talk and try to make something

1583
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:30,779
like robin sounds.

1584
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:36,013
Oh! to think that he should actually lether come as near to him as that!

1585
01:24:36,013 --> 01:24:40,032
He knew nothing in the world would make herput out her hand toward him or startle him

1586
01:24:40,032 --> 01:24:42,066
in the least tiniest way.

1587
01:24:42,066 --> 01:24:46,094
He knew it because he was a real person--only nicer than any other person in the

1588
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:49,074
world.She was so happy that she scarcely dared to

1589
01:24:49,074 --> 01:24:50,029
breathe.

1590
01:24:50,029 --> 01:24:53,589
The flower-bed was not quite bare.

1591
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,036
It was bare of flowers because theperennial plants had been cut down for

1592
01:24:56,036 --> 01:25:00,005
their winter rest, but there were tallshrubs and low ones which grew together at

1593
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:02,529
the back of the bed, and as the robin

1594
01:25:02,529 --> 01:25:07,063
hopped about under them she saw him hopover a small pile of freshly turned up

1595
01:25:07,063 --> 01:25:10,459
earth.He stopped on it to look for a worm.

1596
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:14,009
The earth had been turned up because a doghad been trying to dig up a mole and he had

1597
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:15,091
scratched quite a deep hole.

1598
01:25:15,091 --> 01:25:20,081
Mary looked at it, not really knowing whythe hole was there, and as she looked she

1599
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:24,529
saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil.

1600
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:29,041
It was something like a ring of rusty ironor brass and when the robin flew up into a

1601
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:33,066
tree nearby she put out her hand and pickedthe ring up.

1602
01:25:33,066 --> 01:25:38,035
It was more than a ring, however; it was anold key which looked as if it had been

1603
01:25:38,035 --> 01:25:40,062
buried a long time.

1604
01:25:40,062 --> 01:25:44,043
Mistress Mary stood up and looked at itwith an almost frightened face as it hung

1605
01:25:44,043 --> 01:25:48,008
from her finger."Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,"

1606
01:25:48,008 --> 01:25:50,019
she said in a whisper.

1607
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:57,000
"Perhaps it is the key to the garden!"

1608
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
>

1609
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:07,025
CHAPTER VIIITHE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY

1610
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:11,065
She looked at the key quite a long time.She turned it over and over, and thought

1611
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,011
about it.

1612
01:26:12,011 --> 01:26:17,073
As I have said before, she was not a childwho had been trained to ask permission or

1613
01:26:17,073 --> 01:26:20,031
consult her elders about things.

1614
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:24,075
All she thought about the key was that ifit was the key to the closed garden, and

1615
01:26:24,075 --> 01:26:29,031
she could find out where the door was, shecould perhaps open it and see what was

1616
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:33,989
inside the walls, and what had happened tothe old rose-trees.

1617
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:37,093
It was because it had been shut up so longthat she wanted to see it.

1618
01:26:37,093 --> 01:26:42,004
It seemed as if it must be different fromother places and that something strange

1619
01:26:42,004 --> 01:26:45,159
must have happened to it during ten years.

1620
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:49,769
Besides that, if she liked it she could gointo it every day and shut the door behind

1621
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:54,019
her, and she could make up some play of herown and play it quite alone, because nobody

1622
01:26:54,019 --> 01:26:56,026
would ever know where she was, but would

1623
01:26:56,026 --> 01:26:59,369
think the door was still locked and the keyburied in the earth.

1624
01:26:59,369 --> 01:27:03,057
The thought of that pleased her very much.

1625
01:27:03,057 --> 01:27:07,067
Living as it were, all by herself in ahouse with a hundred mysteriously closed

1626
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:12,054
rooms and having nothing whatever to do toamuse herself, had set her inactive brain

1627
01:27:12,054 --> 01:27:16,049
to working and was actually awakening herimagination.

1628
01:27:16,049 --> 01:27:21,027
There is no doubt that the fresh, strong,pure air from the moor had a great deal to

1629
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:22,049
do with it.

1630
01:27:22,049 --> 01:27:26,051
Just as it had given her an appetite, andfighting with the wind had stirred her

1631
01:27:26,051 --> 01:27:29,074
blood, so the same things had stirred hermind.

1632
01:27:29,074 --> 01:27:33,073
In India she had always been too hot andlanguid and weak to care much about

1633
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:38,029
anything, but in this place she wasbeginning to care and to want to do new

1634
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:39,068
things.

1635
01:27:39,068 --> 01:27:44,034
Already she felt less "contrary," thoughshe did not know why.

1636
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:47,085
She put the key in her pocket and walked upand down her walk.

1637
01:27:47,085 --> 01:27:51,085
No one but herself ever seemed to comethere, so she could walk slowly and look at

1638
01:27:51,085 --> 01:27:54,089
the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing onit.

1639
01:27:54,089 --> 01:27:57,024
The ivy was the baffling thing.

1640
01:27:57,024 --> 01:28:02,007
Howsoever carefully she looked she couldsee nothing but thickly growing, glossy,

1641
01:28:02,007 --> 01:28:05,089
dark green leaves.She was very much disappointed.

1642
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:09,056
Something of her contrariness came back toher as she paced the walk and looked over

1643
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:14,319
it at the tree-tops inside.It seemed so silly, she said to herself, to

1644
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,017
be near it and not be able to get in.

1645
01:28:17,017 --> 01:28:20,007
She took the key in her pocket when shewent back to the house, and she made up her

1646
01:28:20,007 --> 01:28:24,097
mind that she would always carry it withher when she went out, so that if she ever

1647
01:28:24,097 --> 01:28:28,065
should find the hidden door she would beready.

1648
01:28:28,065 --> 01:28:32,048
Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleepall night at the cottage, but she was back

1649
01:28:32,048 --> 01:28:36,569
at her work in the morning with cheeksredder than ever and in the best of

1650
01:28:36,569 --> 01:28:36,086
spirits.

1651
01:28:36,086 --> 01:28:41,016
"I got up at four o'clock," she said."Eh! it was pretty on th' moor with th'

1652
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:45,209
birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin'about an' th' sun risin'.

1653
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:46,007
I didn't walk all th' way.

1654
01:28:46,007 --> 01:28:50,059
A man gave me a ride in his cart an' I didenjoy myself."

1655
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:53,052
She was full of stories of the delights ofher day out.

1656
01:28:53,052 --> 01:28:57,064
Her mother had been glad to see her andthey had got the baking and washing all out

1657
01:28:57,064 --> 01:29:00,067
of the way.She had even made each of the children a

1658
01:29:00,067 --> 01:29:02,084
doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it.

1659
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:05,064
"I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came infrom playin' on th' moor.

1660
01:29:05,064 --> 01:29:10,077
An' th' cottage all smelt o' nice, cleanhot bakin' an' there was a good fire, an'

1661
01:29:10,077 --> 01:29:12,068
they just shouted for joy.

1662
01:29:12,068 --> 01:29:16,076
Our Dickon he said our cottage was goodenough for a king."

1663
01:29:16,076 --> 01:29:20,088
In the evening they had all sat round thefire, and Martha and her mother had sewed

1664
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:25,002
patches on torn clothes and mendedstockings and Martha had told them about

1665
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:27,004
the little girl who had come from India and

1666
01:29:27,004 --> 01:29:30,989
who had been waited on all her life by whatMartha called "blacks" until she didn't

1667
01:29:30,989 --> 01:29:35,005
know how to put on her own stockings."Eh! they did like to hear about you," said

1668
01:29:35,005 --> 01:29:36,027
Martha.

1669
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:39,056
"They wanted to know all about th' blacksan' about th' ship you came in.

1670
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:43,459
I couldn't tell 'em enough."Mary reflected a little.

1671
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:47,019
"I'll tell you a great deal more beforeyour next day out," she said, "so that you

1672
01:29:47,019 --> 01:29:48,091
will have more to talk about.

1673
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:52,519
I dare say they would like to hear aboutriding on elephants and camels, and about

1674
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:57,043
the officers going to hunt tigers.""My word!" cried delighted Martha.

1675
01:29:57,043 --> 01:29:59,019
"It would set 'em clean off their heads.

1676
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:02,093
Would tha' really do that, Miss?It would be same as a wild beast show like

1677
01:30:02,093 --> 01:30:04,739
we heard they had in York once."

1678
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:08,849
"India is quite different from Yorkshire,"Mary said slowly, as she thought the matter

1679
01:30:08,849 --> 01:30:12,379
over."I never thought of that.

1680
01:30:12,379 --> 01:30:14,097
Did Dickon and your mother like to hear youtalk about me?"

1681
01:30:14,097 --> 01:30:19,009
"Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started outo' his head, they got that round," answered

1682
01:30:19,009 --> 01:30:19,839
Martha.

1683
01:30:19,839 --> 01:30:23,068
"But mother, she was put out about yourseemin' to be all by yourself like.

1684
01:30:23,068 --> 01:30:28,052
She said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got nogoverness for her, nor no nurse?' and I

1685
01:30:28,052 --> 01:30:32,008
said, 'No, he hasn't, though Mrs. Medlocksays he will when he thinks of it, but she

1686
01:30:32,008 --> 01:30:35,074
says he mayn't think of it for two or threeyears.'"

1687
01:30:35,074 --> 01:30:38,639
"I don't want a governess," said Marysharply.

1688
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,809
"But mother says you ought to be learnin'your book by this time an' you ought to

1689
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:46,659
have a woman to look after you, an' shesays: 'Now, Martha, you just think how

1690
01:30:46,659 --> 01:30:48,419
you'd feel yourself, in a big place like

1691
01:30:48,419 --> 01:30:51,339
that, wanderin' about all alone, an' nomother.

1692
01:30:51,339 --> 01:30:55,024
You do your best to cheer her up,' shesays, an' I said I would."

1693
01:30:55,024 --> 01:30:57,809
Mary gave her a long, steady look.

1694
01:30:57,809 --> 01:31:02,819
"You do cheer me up," she said."I like to hear you talk."

1695
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:06,389
Presently Martha went out of the room andcame back with something held in her hands

1696
01:31:06,389 --> 01:31:07,949
under her apron.

1697
01:31:07,949 --> 01:31:10,089
"What does tha' think," she said, with acheerful grin.

1698
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:14,008
"I've brought thee a present.""A present!" exclaimed Mistress Mary.

1699
01:31:14,008 --> 01:31:19,002
How could a cottage full of fourteen hungrypeople give any one a present!

1700
01:31:19,002 --> 01:31:22,129
"A man was drivin' across the moorpeddlin'," Martha explained.

1701
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:24,002
"An' he stopped his cart at our door.

1702
01:31:24,002 --> 01:31:29,249
He had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends, butmother had no money to buy anythin'.

1703
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:32,779
Just as he was goin' away our 'LizabethEllen called out, 'Mother, he's got

1704
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,559
skippin'-ropes with red an' blue handles.'

1705
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:38,043
An' mother she calls out quite sudden,'Here, stop, mister!

1706
01:31:38,043 --> 01:31:39,979
How much are they?'

1707
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:44,729
An' he says 'Tuppence', an' mother shebegan fumblin' in her pocket an' she says

1708
01:31:44,729 --> 01:31:49,409
to me, 'Martha, tha's brought me thy wageslike a good lass, an' I've got four places

1709
01:31:49,409 --> 01:31:51,319
to put every penny, but I'm just goin' to

1710
01:31:51,319 --> 01:31:55,649
take tuppence out of it to buy that child askippin'-rope,' an' she bought one an' here

1711
01:31:55,649 --> 01:31:58,669
it is."She brought it out from under her apron and

1712
01:31:58,669 --> 01:32:01,002
exhibited it quite proudly.

1713
01:32:01,002 --> 01:32:06,059
It was a strong, slender rope with astriped red and blue handle at each end,

1714
01:32:06,059 --> 01:32:09,002
but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before.

1715
01:32:09,002 --> 01:32:11,779
She gazed at it with a mystifiedexpression.

1716
01:32:11,779 --> 01:32:16,029
"What is it for?" she asked curiously."For!" cried out Martha.

1717
01:32:16,029 --> 01:32:19,759
"Does tha' mean that they've not gotskippin'-ropes in India, for all they've

1718
01:32:19,759 --> 01:32:23,096
got elephants and tigers and camels!No wonder most of 'em's black.

1719
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:26,919
This is what it's for; just watch me."

1720
01:32:26,919 --> 01:32:31,339
And she ran into the middle of the roomand, taking a handle in each hand, began to

1721
01:32:31,339 --> 01:32:36,189
skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turnedin her chair to stare at her, and the queer

1722
01:32:36,189 --> 01:32:38,149
faces in the old portraits seemed to stare

1723
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:42,369
at her, too, and wonder what on earth thiscommon little cottager had the impudence to

1724
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:46,599
be doing under their very noses.But Martha did not even see them.

1725
01:32:46,599 --> 01:32:51,179
The interest and curiosity in MistressMary's face delighted her, and she went on

1726
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:54,599
skipping and counted as she skipped untilshe had reached a hundred.

1727
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:56,819
"I could skip longer than that," she saidwhen she stopped.

1728
01:32:56,819 --> 01:33:00,809
"I've skipped as much as five hundred whenI was twelve, but I wasn't as fat then as I

1729
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:03,159
am now, an' I was in practice."

1730
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:06,849
Mary got up from her chair beginning tofeel excited herself.

1731
01:33:06,849 --> 01:33:10,349
"It looks nice," she said."Your mother is a kind woman.

1732
01:33:10,349 --> 01:33:12,529
Do you think I could ever skip like that?"

1733
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:16,189
"You just try it," urged Martha, handingher the skipping-rope.

1734
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:19,649
"You can't skip a hundred at first, but ifyou practice you'll mount up.

1735
01:33:19,649 --> 01:33:20,809
That's what mother said.

1736
01:33:20,809 --> 01:33:24,649
She says, 'Nothin' will do her more goodthan skippin' rope.

1737
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:26,999
It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have.

1738
01:33:26,999 --> 01:33:31,279
Let her play out in th' fresh air skippin'an' it'll stretch her legs an' arms an'

1739
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:32,096
give her some strength in 'em.'"

1740
01:33:32,096 --> 01:33:36,729
It was plain that there was not a greatdeal of strength in Mistress Mary's arms

1741
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:38,969
and legs when she first began to skip.

1742
01:33:38,969 --> 01:33:42,599
She was not very clever at it, but sheliked it so much that she did not want to

1743
01:33:42,599 --> 01:33:46,209
stop."Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o'

1744
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:47,279
doors," said Martha.

1745
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,499
"Mother said I must tell you to keep out o'doors as much as you could, even when it

1746
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:56,619
rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm."Mary put on her coat and hat and took her

1747
01:33:56,619 --> 01:33:57,959
skipping-rope over her arm.

1748
01:33:57,959 --> 01:34:01,589
She opened the door to go out, and thensuddenly thought of something and turned

1749
01:34:01,589 --> 01:34:06,027
back rather slowly."Martha," she said, "they were your wages.

1750
01:34:06,027 --> 01:34:08,369
It was your two-pence really.

1751
01:34:08,369 --> 01:34:11,369
Thank you."She said it stiffly because she was not

1752
01:34:11,369 --> 01:34:15,219
used to thanking people or noticing thatthey did things for her.

1753
01:34:15,219 --> 01:34:19,319
"Thank you," she said, and held out herhand because she did not know what else to

1754
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:20,479
do.

1755
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:23,819
Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake,as if she was not accustomed to this sort

1756
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:25,058
of thing either.Then she laughed.

1757
01:34:25,058 --> 01:34:29,949
"Eh! th' art a queer, old-womanish thing,"she said.

1758
01:34:29,949 --> 01:34:33,051
"If tha'd been our 'Lizabeth Ellen tha'dhave given me a kiss."

1759
01:34:33,051 --> 01:34:35,003
Mary looked stiffer than ever.

1760
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:38,046
"Do you want me to kiss you?"Martha laughed again.

1761
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:42,001
"Nay, not me," she answered."If tha' was different, p'raps tha'd want

1762
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:43,018
to thysel'.

1763
01:34:43,018 --> 01:34:47,068
But tha' isn't.Run off outside an' play with thy rope."

1764
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:51,018
Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as shewent out of the room.

1765
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:55,083
Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Marthawas always rather a puzzle to her.

1766
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:58,095
At first she had disliked her very much,but now she did not.

1767
01:34:58,095 --> 01:35:02,003
The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing.

1768
01:35:02,003 --> 01:35:06,064
She counted and skipped, and skipped andcounted, until her cheeks were quite red,

1769
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:10,062
and she was more interested than she hadever been since she was born.

1770
01:35:10,062 --> 01:35:15,012
The sun was shining and a little wind wasblowing--not a rough wind, but one which

1771
01:35:15,012 --> 01:35:19,036
came in delightful little gusts and broughta fresh scent of newly turned earth with

1772
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:20,004
it.

1773
01:35:20,004 --> 01:35:24,051
She skipped round the fountain garden, andup one walk and down another.

1774
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:28,059
She skipped at last into the kitchen-gardenand saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and

1775
01:35:28,059 --> 01:35:31,045
talking to his robin, which was hoppingabout him.

1776
01:35:31,045 --> 01:35:35,038
She skipped down the walk toward him and helifted his head and looked at her with a

1777
01:35:35,038 --> 01:35:38,067
curious expression.She had wondered if he would notice her.

1778
01:35:38,067 --> 01:35:40,092
She wanted him to see her skip.

1779
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:43,006
"Well!" he exclaimed."Upon my word.

1780
01:35:43,006 --> 01:35:47,006
P'raps tha' art a young 'un, after all, an'p'raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins

1781
01:35:47,006 --> 01:35:48,086
instead of sour buttermilk.

1782
01:35:48,086 --> 01:35:52,097
Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sureas my name's Ben Weatherstaff.

1783
01:35:52,097 --> 01:35:57,002
I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.""I never skipped before," Mary said.

1784
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,032
"I'm just beginning.

1785
01:35:58,032 --> 01:36:01,081
I can only go up to twenty.""Tha' keep on," said Ben.

1786
01:36:01,081 --> 01:36:05,033
"Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young'un that's lived with heathen.

1787
01:36:05,033 --> 01:36:08,079
Just see how he's watchin' thee," jerkinghis head toward the robin.

1788
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,043
"He followed after thee yesterday.He'll be at it again today.

1789
01:36:12,043 --> 01:36:15,000
He'll be bound to find out what th'skippin'-rope is.

1790
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,079
He's never seen one.

1791
01:36:15,079 --> 01:36:19,073
Eh!" shaking his head at the bird, "tha'curiosity will be th' death of thee

1792
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:22,087
sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp."

1793
01:36:22,087 --> 01:36:25,095
Mary skipped round all the gardens andround the orchard, resting every few

1794
01:36:25,095 --> 01:36:26,077
minutes.

1795
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:31,056
At length she went to her own special walkand made up her mind to try if she could

1796
01:36:31,056 --> 01:36:33,003
skip the whole length of it.

1797
01:36:33,003 --> 01:36:38,005
It was a good long skip and she beganslowly, but before she had gone half-way

1798
01:36:38,005 --> 01:36:42,066
down the path she was so hot and breathlessthat she was obliged to stop.

1799
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:46,045
She did not mind much, because she hadalready counted up to thirty.

1800
01:36:46,045 --> 01:36:51,006
She stopped with a little laugh ofpleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the

1801
01:36:51,006 --> 01:36:53,086
robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.

1802
01:36:53,086 --> 01:36:57,001
He had followed her and he greeted her witha chirp.

1803
01:36:57,001 --> 01:37:00,068
As Mary had skipped toward him she feltsomething heavy in her pocket strike

1804
01:37:00,068 --> 01:37:04,087
against her at each jump, and when she sawthe robin she laughed again.

1805
01:37:04,087 --> 01:37:07,056
"You showed me where the key wasyesterday," she said.

1806
01:37:07,056 --> 01:37:11,048
"You ought to show me the door today; but Idon't believe you know!"

1807
01:37:11,048 --> 01:37:15,037
The robin flew from his swinging spray ofivy on to the top of the wall and he opened

1808
01:37:15,037 --> 01:37:19,092
his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill,merely to show off.

1809
01:37:19,092 --> 01:37:23,009
Nothing in the world is quite as adorablylovely as a robin when he shows off--and

1810
01:37:23,009 --> 01:37:26,002
they are nearly always doing it.

1811
01:37:26,002 --> 01:37:31,072
Mary Lennox had heard a great deal aboutMagic in her Ayah's stories, and she always

1812
01:37:31,072 --> 01:37:35,007
said that what happened almost at thatmoment was Magic.

1813
01:37:35,007 --> 01:37:40,049
One of the nice little gusts of wind rusheddown the walk, and it was a stronger one

1814
01:37:40,049 --> 01:37:41,055
than the rest.

1815
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:45,022
It was strong enough to wave the branchesof the trees, and it was more than strong

1816
01:37:45,022 --> 01:37:50,079
enough to sway the trailing sprays ofuntrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.

1817
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:55,054
Mary had stepped close to the robin, andsuddenly the gust of wind swung aside some

1818
01:37:55,054 --> 01:38:00,049
loose ivy trails, and more suddenly stillshe jumped toward it and caught it in her

1819
01:38:00,049 --> 01:38:01,018
hand.

1820
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:05,045
This she did because she had seen somethingunder it--a round knob which had been

1821
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:10,015
covered by the leaves hanging over it.It was the knob of a door.

1822
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:13,099
She put her hands under the leaves andbegan to pull and push them aside.

1823
01:38:13,099 --> 01:38:18,097
Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was aloose and swinging curtain, though some had

1824
01:38:18,097 --> 01:38:21,031
crept over wood and iron.

1825
01:38:21,031 --> 01:38:25,001
Mary's heart began to thump and her handsto shake a little in her delight and

1826
01:38:25,001 --> 01:38:26,024
excitement.

1827
01:38:26,024 --> 01:38:30,054
The robin kept singing and twittering awayand tilting his head on one side, as if he

1828
01:38:30,054 --> 01:38:32,028
were as excited as she was.

1829
01:38:32,028 --> 01:38:36,047
What was this under her hands which wassquare and made of iron and which her

1830
01:38:36,047 --> 01:38:38,049
fingers found a hole in?

1831
01:38:38,049 --> 01:38:42,006
It was the lock of the door which had beenclosed ten years and she put her hand in

1832
01:38:42,006 --> 01:38:47,005
her pocket, drew out the key and found itfitted the keyhole.

1833
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:49,001
She put the key in and turned it.

1834
01:38:49,001 --> 01:38:52,087
It took two hands to do it, but it didturn.

1835
01:38:52,087 --> 01:38:57,092
And then she took a long breath and lookedbehind her up the long walk to see if any

1836
01:38:57,092 --> 01:38:59,076
one was coming.

1837
01:38:59,076 --> 01:39:01,003
No one was coming.

1838
01:39:01,003 --> 01:39:06,019
No one ever did come, it seemed, and shetook another long breath, because she could

1839
01:39:06,019 --> 01:39:11,087
not help it, and she held back the swingingcurtain of ivy and pushed back the door

1840
01:39:11,087 --> 01:39:15,053
which opened slowly--slowly.

1841
01:39:15,053 --> 01:39:19,063
Then she slipped through it, and shut itbehind her, and stood with her back against

1842
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:24,015
it, looking about her and breathing quitefast with excitement, and wonder, and

1843
01:39:24,015 --> 01:39:25,089
delight.

1844
01:39:25,089 --> 01:39:32,075
She was standing inside the secret garden.

1845
01:39:32,075 --> 01:39:33,075
>

1846
01:39:33,075 --> 01:39:42,959
CHAPTER IXTHE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LIVED IN

1847
01:39:42,959 --> 01:39:47,091
It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine.

1848
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:52,025
The high walls which shut it in werecovered with the leafless stems of climbing

1849
01:39:52,025 --> 01:39:55,011
roses which were so thick that they werematted together.

1850
01:39:55,011 --> 01:40:01,073
Mary Lennox knew they were roses becauseshe had seen a great many roses in India.

1851
01:40:01,073 --> 01:40:06,041
All the ground was covered with grass of awintry brown and out of it grew clumps of

1852
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:10,014
bushes which were surely rosebushes if theywere alive.

1853
01:40:10,014 --> 01:40:12,098
There were numbers of standard roses whichhad so spread their branches that they were

1854
01:40:12,098 --> 01:40:12,098
like little trees.

1855
01:40:12,098 --> 01:40:19,094
There were other trees in the garden, andone of the things which made the place look

1856
01:40:19,094 --> 01:40:25,061
strangest and loveliest was that climbingroses had run all over them and swung down

1857
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:28,019
long tendrils which made light swaying

1858
01:40:28,019 --> 01:40:33,012
curtains, and here and there they hadcaught at each other or at a far-reaching

1859
01:40:33,012 --> 01:40:37,022
branch and had crept from one tree toanother and made lovely bridges of

1860
01:40:37,022 --> 01:40:37,739
themselves.

1861
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:43,036
There were neither leaves nor roses on themnow and Mary did not know whether they were

1862
01:40:43,036 --> 01:40:49,015
dead or alive, but their thin gray or brownbranches and sprays looked like a sort of

1863
01:40:49,015 --> 01:40:51,047
hazy mantle spreading over everything,

1864
01:40:51,047 --> 01:40:57,659
walls, and trees, and even brown grass,where they had fallen from their fastenings

1865
01:40:57,659 --> 01:41:02,056
and run along the ground.It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree

1866
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:05,119
which made it all look so mysterious.

1867
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:09,019
Mary had thought it must be different fromother gardens which had not been left all

1868
01:41:09,019 --> 01:41:14,029
by themselves so long; and indeed it wasdifferent from any other place she had ever

1869
01:41:14,029 --> 01:41:15,093
seen in her life.

1870
01:41:15,093 --> 01:41:20,074
"How still it is!" she whispered."How still!"

1871
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:24,038
Then she waited a moment and listened atthe stillness.

1872
01:41:24,038 --> 01:41:28,006
The robin, who had flown to his treetop,was still as all the rest.

1873
01:41:28,006 --> 01:41:33,093
He did not even flutter his wings; he satwithout stirring, and looked at Mary.

1874
01:41:33,093 --> 01:41:36,005
"No wonder it is still," she whisperedagain.

1875
01:41:36,005 --> 01:41:42,649
"I am the first person who has spoken inhere for ten years."

1876
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:46,959
She moved away from the door, stepping assoftly as if she were afraid of awakening

1877
01:41:46,959 --> 01:41:50,002
some one.She was glad that there was grass under her

1878
01:41:50,002 --> 01:41:53,079
feet and that her steps made no sounds.

1879
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:58,002
She walked under one of the fairy-like grayarches between the trees and looked up at

1880
01:41:58,002 --> 01:42:03,269
the sprays and tendrils which formed them."I wonder if they are all quite dead," she

1881
01:42:03,269 --> 01:42:03,079
said.

1882
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:09,519
"Is it all a quite dead garden?I wish it wasn't."

1883
01:42:09,519 --> 01:42:13,239
If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she couldhave told whether the wood was alive by

1884
01:42:13,239 --> 01:42:17,809
looking at it, but she could only see thatthere were only gray or brown sprays and

1885
01:42:17,809 --> 01:42:22,939
branches and none showed any signs of evena tiny leaf-bud anywhere.

1886
01:42:22,939 --> 01:42:27,719
But she was inside the wonderful garden andshe could come through the door under the

1887
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:33,004
ivy any time and she felt as if she hadfound a world all her own.

1888
01:42:33,004 --> 01:42:37,999
The sun was shining inside the four wallsand the high arch of blue sky over this

1889
01:42:37,999 --> 01:42:42,849
particular piece of Misselthwaite seemedeven more brilliant and soft than it was

1890
01:42:42,849 --> 01:42:44,659
over the moor.

1891
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:48,889
The robin flew down from his tree-top andhopped about or flew after her from one

1892
01:42:48,889 --> 01:42:52,879
bush to another.He chirped a good deal and had a very busy

1893
01:42:52,879 --> 01:42:55,048
air, as if he were showing her things.

1894
01:42:55,048 --> 01:43:00,189
Everything was strange and silent and sheseemed to be hundreds of miles away from

1895
01:43:00,189 --> 01:43:04,599
any one, but somehow she did not feellonely at all.

1896
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:09,469
All that troubled her was her wish that sheknew whether all the roses were dead, or if

1897
01:43:09,469 --> 01:43:13,109
perhaps some of them had lived and mightput out leaves and buds as the weather got

1898
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:14,169
warmer.

1899
01:43:14,169 --> 01:43:16,639
She did not want it to be a quite deadgarden.

1900
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,799
If it were a quite alive garden, howwonderful it would be, and what thousands

1901
01:43:21,799 --> 01:43:24,073
of roses would grow on every side!

1902
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:28,819
Her skipping-rope had hung over her armwhen she came in and after she had walked

1903
01:43:28,819 --> 01:43:32,969
about for a while she thought she wouldskip round the whole garden, stopping when

1904
01:43:32,969 --> 01:43:34,169
she wanted to look at things.

1905
01:43:34,169 --> 01:43:40,389
There seemed to have been grass paths hereand there, and in one or two corners there

1906
01:43:40,389 --> 01:43:45,829
were alcoves of evergreen with stone seatsor tall moss-covered flower urns in them.

1907
01:43:45,829 --> 01:43:49,949
As she came near the second of thesealcoves she stopped skipping.

1908
01:43:49,949 --> 01:43:54,075
There had once been a flowerbed in it, andshe thought she saw something sticking out

1909
01:43:54,075 --> 01:43:59,059
of the black earth--some sharp little palegreen points.

1910
01:43:59,059 --> 01:44:04,064
She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff hadsaid and she knelt down to look at them.

1911
01:44:04,064 --> 01:44:10,053
"Yes, they are tiny growing things and theymight be crocuses or snowdrops or

1912
01:44:10,053 --> 01:44:12,038
daffodils," she whispered.

1913
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:16,032
She bent very close to them and sniffed thefresh scent of the damp earth.

1914
01:44:16,032 --> 01:44:20,064
She liked it very much."Perhaps there are some other ones coming

1915
01:44:20,064 --> 01:44:22,006
up in other places," she said.

1916
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:27,063
"I will go all over the garden and look."She did not skip, but walked.

1917
01:44:27,063 --> 01:44:31,000
She went slowly and kept her eyes on theground.

1918
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,007
She looked in the old border beds and amongthe grass, and after she had gone round,

1919
01:44:35,007 --> 01:44:41,007
trying to miss nothing, she had found everso many more sharp, pale green points, and

1920
01:44:41,007 --> 01:44:43,079
she had become quite excited again.

1921
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:47,005
"It isn't a quite dead garden," she criedout softly to herself.

1922
01:44:47,005 --> 01:44:51,063
"Even if the roses are dead, there areother things alive."

1923
01:44:51,063 --> 01:44:55,063
She did not know anything about gardening,but the grass seemed so thick in some of

1924
01:44:55,063 --> 01:44:59,031
the places where the green points werepushing their way through that she thought

1925
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:02,001
they did not seem to have room enough togrow.

1926
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:07,003
She searched about until she found a rathersharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug

1927
01:45:07,003 --> 01:45:11,011
and weeded out the weeds and grass untilshe made nice little clear places around

1928
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:12,013
them.

1929
01:45:12,013 --> 01:45:15,094
"Now they look as if they could breathe,"she said, after she had finished with the

1930
01:45:15,094 --> 01:45:18,007
first ones."I am going to do ever so many more.

1931
01:45:18,007 --> 01:45:20,028
I'll do all I can see.

1932
01:45:20,028 --> 01:45:24,017
If I haven't time today I can cometomorrow."

1933
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:29,002
She went from place to place, and dug andweeded, and enjoyed herself so immensely

1934
01:45:29,002 --> 01:45:33,035
that she was led on from bed to bed andinto the grass under the trees.

1935
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:37,067
The exercise made her so warm that shefirst threw her coat off, and then her hat,

1936
01:45:37,067 --> 01:45:42,033
and without knowing it she was smiling downon to the grass and the pale green points

1937
01:45:42,033 --> 01:45:43,079
all the time.

1938
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:47,091
The robin was tremendously busy.He was very much pleased to see gardening

1939
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:51,093
begun on his own estate.He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.

1940
01:45:51,093 --> 01:45:55,047
Where gardening is done all sorts ofdelightful things to eat are turned up with

1941
01:45:55,047 --> 01:45:56,042
the soil.

1942
01:45:56,042 --> 01:46:00,096
Now here was this new kind of creature whowas not half Ben's size and yet had had the

1943
01:46:00,096 --> 01:46:04,078
sense to come into his garden and begin atonce.

1944
01:46:04,078 --> 01:46:08,089
Mistress Mary worked in her garden until itwas time to go to her midday dinner.

1945
01:46:08,089 --> 01:46:12,045
In fact, she was rather late inremembering, and when she put on her coat

1946
01:46:12,045 --> 01:46:16,005
and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope,she could not believe that she had been

1947
01:46:16,005 --> 01:46:17,075
working two or three hours.

1948
01:46:17,075 --> 01:46:22,078
She had been actually happy all the time;and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale

1949
01:46:22,078 --> 01:46:27,028
green points were to be seen in clearedplaces, looking twice as cheerful as they

1950
01:46:27,028 --> 01:46:31,012
had looked before when the grass and weedshad been smothering them.

1951
01:46:31,012 --> 01:46:35,046
"I shall come back this afternoon," shesaid, looking all round at her new kingdom,

1952
01:46:35,046 --> 01:46:39,023
and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard her.

1953
01:46:39,023 --> 01:46:43,077
Then she ran lightly across the grass,pushed open the slow old door and slipped

1954
01:46:43,077 --> 01:46:45,062
through it under the ivy.

1955
01:46:45,062 --> 01:46:50,028
She had such red cheeks and such brighteyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was

1956
01:46:50,028 --> 01:46:53,048
delighted."Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice

1957
01:46:53,048 --> 01:46:54,071
puddin'!" she said.

1958
01:46:54,071 --> 01:46:59,034
"Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell herwhat th' skippin'-rope's done for thee."

1959
01:46:59,034 --> 01:47:02,008
In the course of her digging with herpointed stick Mistress Mary had found

1960
01:47:02,008 --> 01:47:06,005
herself digging up a sort of white rootrather like an onion.

1961
01:47:06,005 --> 01:47:11,003
She had put it back in its place and pattedthe earth carefully down on it and just now

1962
01:47:11,003 --> 01:47:12,096
she wondered if Martha could tell her whatit was.

1963
01:47:12,096 --> 01:47:17,073
"Martha," she said, "what are those whiteroots that look like onions?"

1964
01:47:17,073 --> 01:47:22,045
"They're bulbs," answered Martha."Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.

1965
01:47:22,045 --> 01:47:27,052
Th' very little ones are snowdrops an'crocuses an' th' big ones are narcissuses

1966
01:47:27,052 --> 01:47:32,012
an' jonquils and daffydowndillys.Th' biggest of all is lilies an' purple

1967
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:32,047
flags.

1968
01:47:32,047 --> 01:47:35,068
Eh! they are nice.Dickon's got a whole lot of 'em planted in

1969
01:47:35,068 --> 01:47:38,889
our bit o' garden.""Does Dickon know all about them?" asked

1970
01:47:38,889 --> 01:47:42,004
Mary, a new idea taking possession of her.

1971
01:47:42,004 --> 01:47:45,002
"Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of abrick walk.

1972
01:47:45,002 --> 01:47:47,055
Mother says he just whispers things out o'th' ground."

1973
01:47:47,055 --> 01:47:50,023
"Do bulbs live a long time?

1974
01:47:50,023 --> 01:47:55,038
Would they live years and years if no onehelped them?" inquired Mary anxiously.

1975
01:47:55,038 --> 01:47:57,008
"They're things as helps themselves," saidMartha.

1976
01:47:57,008 --> 01:48:00,077
"That's why poor folk can afford to have'em.

1977
01:48:00,077 --> 01:48:04,059
If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'llwork away underground for a lifetime an'

1978
01:48:04,059 --> 01:48:05,889
spread out an' have little 'uns.

1979
01:48:05,889 --> 01:48:10,043
There's a place in th' park woods herewhere there's snowdrops by thousands.

1980
01:48:10,043 --> 01:48:13,329
They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshirewhen th' spring comes.

1981
01:48:13,329 --> 01:48:15,099
No one knows when they was first planted."

1982
01:48:15,099 --> 01:48:18,379
"I wish the spring was here now," saidMary.

1983
01:48:18,379 --> 01:48:21,054
"I want to see all the things that grow inEngland."

1984
01:48:21,054 --> 01:48:24,329
She had finished her dinner and gone to herfavorite seat on the hearth-rug.

1985
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:28,049
"I wish--I wish I had a little spade," shesaid.

1986
01:48:28,049 --> 01:48:31,999
"Whatever does tha' want a spade for?"asked Martha, laughing.

1987
01:48:31,999 --> 01:48:35,189
"Art tha' goin' to take to diggin'?I must tell mother that, too."

1988
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:38,099
Mary looked at the fire and pondered alittle.

1989
01:48:38,099 --> 01:48:42,499
She must be careful if she meant to keepher secret kingdom.

1990
01:48:42,499 --> 01:48:47,004
She wasn't doing any harm, but if Mr.Craven found out about the open door he

1991
01:48:47,004 --> 01:48:50,959
would be fearfully angry and get a new keyand lock it up forevermore.

1992
01:48:50,959 --> 01:48:52,054
She really could not bear that.

1993
01:48:52,054 --> 01:48:58,259
"This is such a big lonely place," she saidslowly, as if she were turning matters over

1994
01:48:58,259 --> 01:49:01,085
in her mind."The house is lonely, and the park is

1995
01:49:01,085 --> 01:49:04,139
lonely, and the gardens are lonely.

1996
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:08,099
So many places seem shut up.I never did many things in India, but there

1997
01:49:08,099 --> 01:49:13,008
were more people to look at--natives andsoldiers marching by--and sometimes bands

1998
01:49:13,008 --> 01:49:17,016
playing, and my Ayah told me stories.

1999
01:49:17,016 --> 01:49:20,049
There is no one to talk to here except youand Ben Weatherstaff.

2000
01:49:20,049 --> 01:49:24,899
And you have to do your work and BenWeatherstaff won't speak to me often.

2001
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:29,047
I thought if I had a little spade I coulddig somewhere as he does, and I might make

2002
01:49:29,047 --> 01:49:32,037
a little garden if he would give me someseeds."

2003
01:49:32,037 --> 01:49:34,139
Martha's face quite lighted up.

2004
01:49:34,139 --> 01:49:38,022
"There now!" she exclaimed, "if that wasn'tone of th' things mother said.

2005
01:49:38,022 --> 01:49:42,199
She says, 'There's such a lot o' room inthat big place, why don't they give her a

2006
01:49:42,199 --> 01:49:46,019
bit for herself, even if she doesn't plantnothin' but parsley an' radishes?

2007
01:49:46,019 --> 01:49:49,639
She'd dig an' rake away an' be right downhappy over it.'

2008
01:49:49,639 --> 01:49:53,061
Them was the very words she said.""Were they?" said Mary.

2009
01:49:53,061 --> 01:49:55,055
"How many things she knows, doesn't she?"

2010
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:59,054
"Eh!" said Martha."It's like she says: 'A woman as brings up

2011
01:49:59,054 --> 01:50:02,709
twelve children learns something besidesher A B C.

2012
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:06,699
Children's as good as 'rithmetic to set youfindin' out things.'"

2013
01:50:06,699 --> 01:50:09,047
"How much would a spade cost--a littleone?"

2014
01:50:09,047 --> 01:50:10,092
Mary asked.

2015
01:50:10,092 --> 01:50:15,073
"Well," was Martha's reflective answer, "atThwaite village there's a shop or so an' I

2016
01:50:15,073 --> 01:50:19,319
saw little garden sets with a spade an' arake an' a fork all tied together for two

2017
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:19,829
shillings.

2018
01:50:19,829 --> 01:50:22,006
An' they was stout enough to work with,too."

2019
01:50:22,006 --> 01:50:25,819
"I've got more than that in my purse," saidMary.

2020
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:29,099
"Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings andMrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr.

2021
01:50:29,099 --> 01:50:33,019
Craven.""Did he remember thee that much?" exclaimed

2022
01:50:33,019 --> 01:50:34,018
Martha.

2023
01:50:34,018 --> 01:50:36,085
"Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shillinga week to spend.

2024
01:50:36,085 --> 01:50:39,074
She gives me one every Saturday.I didn't know what to spend it on."

2025
01:50:39,074 --> 01:50:42,003
"My word! that's riches," said Martha.

2026
01:50:42,003 --> 01:50:44,869
"Tha' can buy anything in th' world tha'wants.

2027
01:50:44,869 --> 01:50:49,029
Th' rent of our cottage is only one an'threepence an' it's like pullin' eye-teeth

2028
01:50:49,029 --> 01:50:50,319
to get it.

2029
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:53,008
Now I've just thought of somethin',"putting her hands on her hips.

2030
01:50:53,008 --> 01:50:55,068
"What?" said Mary eagerly.

2031
01:50:55,068 --> 01:51:01,059
"In the shop at Thwaite they sell packageso' flower-seeds for a penny each, and our

2032
01:51:01,059 --> 01:51:04,819
Dickon he knows which is th' prettiest onesan' how to make 'em grow.

2033
01:51:04,819 --> 01:51:07,085
He walks over to Thwaite many a day justfor th' fun of it.

2034
01:51:07,085 --> 01:51:10,006
Does tha' know how to print letters?"suddenly.

2035
01:51:10,006 --> 01:51:12,006
"I know how to write," Mary answered.

2036
01:51:12,006 --> 01:51:16,016
Martha shook her head."Our Dickon can only read printin'.

2037
01:51:16,016 --> 01:51:20,029
If tha' could print we could write a letterto him an' ask him to go an' buy th' garden

2038
01:51:20,029 --> 01:51:22,759
tools an' th' seeds at th' same time."

2039
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:25,129
"Oh! you're a good girl!"Mary cried.

2040
01:51:25,129 --> 01:51:28,079
"You are, really!I didn't know you were so nice.

2041
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:30,016
I know I can print letters if I try.

2042
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:33,079
Let's ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and inkand some paper."

2043
01:51:33,079 --> 01:51:36,749
"I've got some of my own," said Martha."I bought 'em so I could print a bit of a

2044
01:51:36,749 --> 01:51:37,098
letter to mother of a Sunday.

2045
01:51:37,098 --> 01:51:41,879
I'll go and get it."She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by

2046
01:51:41,879 --> 01:51:45,016
the fire and twisted her thin little handstogether with sheer pleasure.

2047
01:51:45,016 --> 01:51:50,619
"If I have a spade," she whispered, "I canmake the earth nice and soft and dig up

2048
01:51:50,619 --> 01:51:51,209
weeds.

2049
01:51:51,209 --> 01:51:55,139
If I have seeds and can make flowers growthe garden won't be dead at all--it will

2050
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:57,042
come alive."

2051
01:51:57,042 --> 01:52:01,009
She did not go out again that afternoonbecause when Martha returned with her pen

2052
01:52:01,009 --> 01:52:04,098
and ink and paper she was obliged to clearthe table and carry the plates and dishes

2053
01:52:04,098 --> 01:52:06,091
downstairs and when she got into the

2054
01:52:06,091 --> 01:52:11,029
kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told herto do something, so Mary waited for what

2055
01:52:11,029 --> 01:52:14,179
seemed to her a long time before she cameback.

2056
01:52:14,179 --> 01:52:17,047
Then it was a serious piece of work towrite to Dickon.

2057
01:52:17,047 --> 01:52:20,098
Mary had been taught very little becauseher governesses had disliked her too much

2058
01:52:20,098 --> 01:52:22,036
to stay with her.

2059
01:52:22,036 --> 01:52:26,209
She could not spell particularly well butshe found that she could print letters when

2060
01:52:26,209 --> 01:52:30,189
she tried.This was the letter Martha dictated to her:

2061
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:31,085
"My Dear Dickon:

2062
01:52:31,085 --> 01:52:35,022
This comes hoping to find you well as itleaves me at present.

2063
01:52:35,022 --> 01:52:39,439
Miss Mary has plenty of money and will yougo to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds

2064
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:41,066
and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed.

2065
01:52:41,066 --> 01:52:45,086
Pick the prettiest ones and easy to growbecause she has never done it before and

2066
01:52:45,086 --> 01:52:49,649
lived in India which is different.Give my love to mother and every one of

2067
01:52:49,649 --> 01:52:50,139
you.

2068
01:52:50,139 --> 01:52:54,005
Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more sothat on my next day out you can hear about

2069
01:52:54,005 --> 01:52:58,209
elephants and camels and gentlemen goinghunting lions and tigers.

2070
01:52:58,209 --> 01:53:01,023
"Your loving sister, Martha PhoebeSowerby."

2071
01:53:01,023 --> 01:53:05,309
"We'll put the money in th' envelope an'I'll get th' butcher boy to take it in his

2072
01:53:05,309 --> 01:53:05,055
cart.

2073
01:53:05,055 --> 01:53:08,529
He's a great friend o' Dickon's," saidMartha.

2074
01:53:08,529 --> 01:53:10,189
"How shall I get the things when Dickonbuys them?"

2075
01:53:10,189 --> 01:53:11,085
"He'll bring 'em to you himself.

2076
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:17,001
He'll like to walk over this way.""Oh!" exclaimed Mary, "then I shall see

2077
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:19,149
him!I never thought I should see Dickon."

2078
01:53:19,149 --> 01:53:24,189
"Does tha' want to see him?" asked Marthasuddenly, for Mary had looked so pleased.

2079
01:53:24,189 --> 01:53:27,097
"Yes, I do.I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved.

2080
01:53:27,097 --> 01:53:29,679
I want to see him very much."

2081
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:32,066
Martha gave a little start, as if sheremembered something.

2082
01:53:32,066 --> 01:53:37,439
"Now to think," she broke out, "to think o'me forgettin' that there; an' I thought I

2083
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:39,309
was goin' to tell you first thing thismornin'.

2084
01:53:39,309 --> 01:53:42,939
I asked mother--and she said she'd ask Mrs.Medlock her own self."

2085
01:53:42,939 --> 01:53:45,759
"Do you mean--" Mary began."What I said Tuesday.

2086
01:53:45,759 --> 01:53:50,259
Ask her if you might be driven over to ourcottage some day and have a bit o' mother's

2087
01:53:50,259 --> 01:53:53,449
hot oat cake, an' butter, an' a glass o'milk."

2088
01:53:53,449 --> 01:53:57,279
It seemed as if all the interesting thingswere happening in one day.

2089
01:53:57,279 --> 01:54:01,016
To think of going over the moor in thedaylight and when the sky was blue!

2090
01:54:01,016 --> 01:54:04,399
To think of going into the cottage whichheld twelve children!

2091
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:08,008
"Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let mego?" she asked, quite anxiously.

2092
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:10,119
"Aye, she thinks she would.

2093
01:54:10,119 --> 01:54:14,899
She knows what a tidy woman mother is andhow clean she keeps the cottage."

2094
01:54:14,899 --> 01:54:19,499
"If I went I should see your mother as wellas Dickon," said Mary, thinking it over and

2095
01:54:19,499 --> 01:54:21,029
liking the idea very much.

2096
01:54:21,029 --> 01:54:24,069
"She doesn't seem to be like the mothers inIndia."

2097
01:54:24,069 --> 01:54:28,091
Her work in the garden and the excitementof the afternoon ended by making her feel

2098
01:54:28,091 --> 01:54:30,055
quiet and thoughtful.

2099
01:54:30,055 --> 01:54:34,899
Martha stayed with her until tea-time, butthey sat in comfortable quiet and talked

2100
01:54:34,899 --> 01:54:37,989
very little.But just before Martha went downstairs for

2101
01:54:37,989 --> 01:54:40,139
the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.

2102
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:44,699
"Martha," she said, "has the scullery-maidhad the toothache again today?"

2103
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:50,006
Martha certainly started slightly."What makes thee ask that?" she said.

2104
01:54:50,006 --> 01:54:54,189
"Because when I waited so long for you tocome back I opened the door and walked down

2105
01:54:54,189 --> 01:54:59,001
the corridor to see if you were coming.And I heard that far-off crying again, just

2106
01:54:59,001 --> 01:55:00,809
as we heard it the other night.

2107
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:05,022
There isn't a wind today, so you see itcouldn't have been the wind."

2108
01:55:05,022 --> 01:55:08,529
"Eh!" said Martha restlessly."Tha' mustn't go walkin' about in corridors

2109
01:55:08,529 --> 01:55:09,066
an' listenin'.

2110
01:55:09,066 --> 01:55:13,249
Mr. Craven would be that there angrythere's no knowin' what he'd do."

2111
01:55:13,249 --> 01:55:17,649
"I wasn't listening," said Mary."I was just waiting for you--and I heard

2112
01:55:17,649 --> 01:55:18,029
it.

2113
01:55:18,029 --> 01:55:20,098
That's three times.""My word!

2114
01:55:20,098 --> 01:55:25,319
There's Mrs. Medlock's bell," said Martha,and she almost ran out of the room.

2115
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:30,799
"It's the strangest house any one everlived in," said Mary drowsily, as she

2116
01:55:30,799 --> 01:55:34,629
dropped her head on the cushioned seat ofthe armchair near her.

2117
01:55:34,629 --> 01:55:39,319
Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-ropehad made her feel so comfortably tired that

2118
01:55:39,319 --> 01:55:43,075
she fell asleep.

2119
01:55:43,075 --> 01:55:44,075

2120

CHAPTER XDICKON

2121
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:56,036
The sun shone down for nearly a week on thesecret garden.

2122
01:55:56,036 --> 01:55:59,073
The Secret Garden was what Mary called itwhen she was thinking of it.

2123
01:55:59,073 --> 01:56:04,011
She liked the name, and she liked stillmore the feeling that when its beautiful

2124
01:56:04,011 --> 01:56:07,074
old walls shut her in no one knew where shewas.

2125
01:56:07,074 --> 01:56:12,067
It seemed almost like being shut out of theworld in some fairy place.

2126
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:17,016
The few books she had read and liked hadbeen fairy-story books, and she had read of

2127
01:56:17,016 --> 01:56:19,066
secret gardens in some of the stories.

2128
01:56:19,066 --> 01:56:23,076
Sometimes people went to sleep in them fora hundred years, which she had thought must

2129
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:25,329
be rather stupid.

2130
01:56:25,329 --> 01:56:29,929
She had no intention of going to sleep,and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake

2131
01:56:29,929 --> 01:56:32,044
every day which passed at Misselthwaite.

2132
01:56:32,044 --> 01:56:36,042
She was beginning to like to be out ofdoors; she no longer hated the wind, but

2133
01:56:36,042 --> 01:56:40,039
enjoyed it.She could run faster, and longer, and she

2134
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:41,969
could skip up to a hundred.

2135
01:56:41,969 --> 01:56:44,999
The bulbs in the secret garden must havebeen much astonished.

2136
01:56:44,999 --> 01:56:49,229
Such nice clear places were made round themthat they had all the breathing space they

2137
01:56:49,229 --> 01:56:53,088
wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary hadknown it, they began to cheer up under the

2138
01:56:53,088 --> 01:56:56,059
dark earth and work tremendously.

2139
01:56:56,059 --> 01:57:00,057
The sun could get at them and warm them,and when the rain came down it could reach

2140
01:57:00,057 --> 01:57:03,619
them at once, so they began to feel verymuch alive.

2141
01:57:03,619 --> 01:57:09,084
Mary was an odd, determined little person,and now she had something interesting to be

2142
01:57:09,084 --> 01:57:13,013
determined about, she was very muchabsorbed, indeed.

2143
01:57:13,013 --> 01:57:17,689
She worked and dug and pulled up weedssteadily, only becoming more pleased with

2144
01:57:17,689 --> 01:57:19,084
her work every hour instead of tiring ofit.

2145
01:57:19,084 --> 01:57:24,369
It seemed to her like a fascinating sort ofplay.

2146
01:57:24,369 --> 01:57:28,979
She found many more of the sprouting palegreen points than she had ever hoped to

2147
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:29,052
find.

2148
01:57:29,052 --> 01:57:33,089
They seemed to be starting up everywhereand each day she was sure she found tiny

2149
01:57:33,089 --> 01:57:38,001
new ones, some so tiny that they barelypeeped above the earth.

2150
01:57:38,001 --> 01:57:43,179
There were so many that she remembered whatMartha had said about the "snowdrops by the

2151
01:57:43,179 --> 01:57:47,002
thousands," and about bulbs spreading andmaking new ones.

2152
01:57:47,002 --> 01:57:51,439
These had been left to themselves for tenyears and perhaps they had spread, like the

2153
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:55,679
snowdrops, into thousands.She wondered how long it would be before

2154
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,031
they showed that they were flowers.

2155
01:57:58,031 --> 01:58:01,068
Sometimes she stopped digging to look atthe garden and try to imagine what it would

2156
01:58:01,068 --> 01:58:04,081
be like when it was covered with thousandsof lovely things in bloom.

2157
01:58:04,081 --> 01:58:10,379
During that week of sunshine, she becamemore intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.

2158
01:58:10,379 --> 01:58:14,092
She surprised him several times by seemingto start up beside him as if she sprang out

2159
01:58:14,092 --> 01:58:16,033
of the earth.

2160
01:58:16,033 --> 01:58:19,083
The truth was that she was afraid that hewould pick up his tools and go away if he

2161
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:24,319
saw her coming, so she always walked towardhim as silently as possible.

2162
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:28,799
But, in fact, he did not object to her asstrongly as he had at first.

2163
01:58:28,799 --> 01:58:33,031
Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered byher evident desire for his elderly company.

2164
01:58:33,031 --> 01:58:37,002
Then, also, she was more civil than she hadbeen.

2165
01:58:37,002 --> 01:58:41,019
He did not know that when she first saw himshe spoke to him as she would have spoken

2166
01:58:41,019 --> 01:58:45,689
to a native, and had not known that across, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not

2167
01:58:45,689 --> 01:58:50,012
accustomed to salaam to his masters, and bemerely commanded by them to do things.

2168
01:58:50,012 --> 01:58:55,489
"Tha'rt like th' robin," he said to her onemorning when he lifted his head and saw her

2169
01:58:55,489 --> 01:58:56,079
standing by him.

2170
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:59,093
"I never knows when I shall see thee orwhich side tha'll come from."

2171
01:58:59,093 --> 01:59:04,081
"He's friends with me now," said Mary."That's like him," snapped Ben

2172
01:59:04,081 --> 01:59:05,319
Weatherstaff.

2173
01:59:05,319 --> 01:59:08,023
"Makin' up to th' women folk just forvanity an' flightiness.

2174
01:59:08,023 --> 01:59:11,939
There's nothin' he wouldn't do for th' sakeo' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail-

2175
01:59:11,939 --> 01:59:12,879
feathers.

2176
01:59:12,879 --> 01:59:15,061
He's as full o' pride as an egg's full o'meat."

2177
01:59:15,061 --> 01:59:20,269
He very seldom talked much and sometimesdid not even answer Mary's questions except

2178
01:59:20,269 --> 01:59:24,079
by a grunt, but this morning he said morethan usual.

2179
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:28,047
He stood up and rested one hobnailed booton the top of his spade while he looked her

2180
01:59:28,047 --> 01:59:31,048
over."How long has tha' been here?" he jerked

2181
01:59:31,048 --> 01:59:32,045
out.

2182
01:59:32,045 --> 01:59:36,072
"I think it's about a month," she answered."Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite

2183
01:59:36,072 --> 01:59:40,011
credit," he said."Tha's a bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's

2184
01:59:40,011 --> 01:59:41,043
not quite so yeller.

2185
01:59:41,043 --> 01:59:44,065
Tha' looked like a young plucked crow whentha' first came into this garden.

2186
01:59:44,065 --> 01:59:50,067
Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on anuglier, sourer faced young 'un."

2187
01:59:50,067 --> 01:59:54,379
Mary was not vain and as she had neverthought much of her looks she was not

2188
01:59:54,379 --> 01:59:57,059
greatly disturbed."I know I'm fatter," she said.

2189
01:59:57,059 --> 01:59:59,129
"My stockings are getting tighter.

2190
01:59:59,129 --> 02:00:03,079
They used to make wrinkles.There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff."

2191
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:07,038
There, indeed, was the robin, and shethought he looked nicer than ever.

2192
02:00:07,038 --> 02:00:11,057
His red waistcoat was as glossy as satinand he flirted his wings and tail and

2193
02:00:11,057 --> 02:00:15,699
tilted his head and hopped about with allsorts of lively graces.

2194
02:00:15,699 --> 02:00:18,199
He seemed determined to make BenWeatherstaff admire him.

2195
02:00:18,199 --> 02:00:22,065
But Ben was sarcastic."Aye, there tha' art!" he said.

2196
02:00:22,065 --> 02:00:27,021
"Tha' can put up with me for a bitsometimes when tha's got no one better.

2197
02:00:27,021 --> 02:00:31,058
Tha's been reddenin' up thy waistcoat an'polishin' thy feathers this two weeks.

2198
02:00:31,058 --> 02:00:33,012
I know what tha's up to.

2199
02:00:33,012 --> 02:00:37,083
Tha's courtin' some bold young madamsomewhere tellin' thy lies to her about

2200
02:00:37,083 --> 02:00:42,008
bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Mooran' ready to fight all th' rest of 'em."

2201
02:00:42,008 --> 02:00:45,729
"Oh! look at him!" exclaimed Mary.

2202
02:00:45,729 --> 02:00:49,479
The robin was evidently in a fascinating,bold mood.

2203
02:00:49,479 --> 02:00:55,038
He hopped closer and closer and looked atBen Weatherstaff more and more engagingly.

2204
02:00:55,038 --> 02:00:59,009
He flew on to the nearest currant bush andtilted his head and sang a little song

2205
02:00:59,009 --> 02:01:00,043
right at him.

2206
02:01:00,043 --> 02:01:05,889
"Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin'that," said Ben, wrinkling his face up in

2207
02:01:05,889 --> 02:01:09,066
such a way that Mary felt sure he wastrying not to look pleased.

2208
02:01:09,066 --> 02:01:14,069
"Tha' thinks no one can stand out againstthee--that's what tha' thinks."

2209
02:01:14,069 --> 02:01:18,036
The robin spread his wings--Mary couldscarcely believe her eyes.

2210
02:01:18,036 --> 02:01:22,069
He flew right up to the handle of BenWeatherstaff's spade and alighted on the

2211
02:01:22,069 --> 02:01:25,043
top of it.Then the old man's face wrinkled itself

2212
02:01:25,043 --> 02:01:27,949
slowly into a new expression.

2213
02:01:27,949 --> 02:01:32,003
He stood still as if he were afraid tobreathe--as if he would not have stirred

2214
02:01:32,003 --> 02:01:35,319
for the world, lest his robin should startaway.

2215
02:01:35,319 --> 02:01:37,061
He spoke quite in a whisper.

2216
02:01:37,061 --> 02:01:43,002
"Well, I'm danged!" he said as softly as ifhe were saying something quite different.

2217
02:01:43,002 --> 02:01:45,021
"Tha' does know how to get at a chap--tha'does!

2218
02:01:45,021 --> 02:01:49,024
Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'."

2219
02:01:49,024 --> 02:01:54,199
And he stood without stirring--almostwithout drawing his breath--until the robin

2220
02:01:54,199 --> 02:01:57,569
gave another flirt to his wings and flewaway.

2221
02:01:57,569 --> 02:02:02,037
Then he stood looking at the handle of thespade as if there might be Magic in it, and

2222
02:02:02,037 --> 02:02:07,003
then he began to dig again and said nothingfor several minutes.

2223
02:02:07,003 --> 02:02:11,037
But because he kept breaking into a slowgrin now and then, Mary was not afraid to

2224
02:02:11,037 --> 02:02:15,639
talk to him."Have you a garden of your own?" she asked.

2225
02:02:15,639 --> 02:02:19,289
"No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin atth' gate."

2226
02:02:19,289 --> 02:02:22,065
"If you had one," said Mary, "what wouldyou plant?"

2227
02:02:22,065 --> 02:02:24,889
"Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions."

2228
02:02:24,889 --> 02:02:28,259
"But if you wanted to make a flowergarden," persisted Mary, "what would you

2229
02:02:28,259 --> 02:02:32,027
plant?""Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but

2230
02:02:32,027 --> 02:02:33,071
mostly roses."

2231
02:02:33,071 --> 02:02:37,759
Mary's face lighted up."Do you like roses?" she said.

2232
02:02:37,759 --> 02:02:41,669
Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threwit aside before he answered.

2233
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:43,027
"Well, yes, I do.

2234
02:02:43,027 --> 02:02:46,319
I was learned that by a young lady I wasgardener to.

2235
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:50,094
She had a lot in a place she was fond of,an' she loved 'em like they was children--

2236
02:02:50,094 --> 02:02:52,043
or robins.

2237
02:02:52,043 --> 02:02:56,949
I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em."He dragged out another weed and scowled at

2238
02:02:56,949 --> 02:03:00,379
it."That were as much as ten year' ago."

2239
02:03:00,379 --> 02:03:03,004
"Where is she now?" asked Mary, muchinterested.

2240
02:03:03,004 --> 02:03:08,005
"Heaven," he answered, and drove his spadedeep into the soil, "'cording to what

2241
02:03:08,005 --> 02:03:10,012
parson says."

2242
02:03:10,012 --> 02:03:13,075
"What happened to the roses?"Mary asked again, more interested than

2243
02:03:13,075 --> 02:03:15,479
ever."They was left to themselves."

2244
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:18,449
Mary was becoming quite excited.

2245
02:03:18,449 --> 02:03:22,019
"Did they quite die?Do roses quite die when they are left to

2246
02:03:22,019 --> 02:03:23,669
themselves?" she ventured.

2247
02:03:23,669 --> 02:03:30,084
"Well, I'd got to like 'em--an' I likedher--an' she liked 'em," Ben Weatherstaff

2248
02:03:30,084 --> 02:03:32,099
admitted reluctantly.

2249
02:03:32,099 --> 02:03:36,024
"Once or twice a year I'd go an' work at'em a bit--prune 'em an' dig about th'

2250
02:03:36,024 --> 02:03:40,289
roots.They run wild, but they was in rich soil,

2251
02:03:40,289 --> 02:03:41,061
so some of 'em lived."

2252
02:03:41,061 --> 02:03:47,139
"When they have no leaves and look gray andbrown and dry, how can you tell whether

2253
02:03:47,139 --> 02:03:49,229
they are dead or alive?" inquired Mary.

2254
02:03:49,229 --> 02:03:54,389
"Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--waittill th' sun shines on th' rain and th'

2255
02:03:54,389 --> 02:03:58,759
rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'llfind out."

2256
02:03:58,759 --> 02:04:01,059
"How--how?" cried Mary, forgetting to becareful.

2257
02:04:01,059 --> 02:04:06,072
"Look along th' twigs an' branches an' iftha' see a bit of a brown lump swelling

2258
02:04:06,072 --> 02:04:10,879
here an' there, watch it after th' warmrain an' see what happens."

2259
02:04:10,879 --> 02:04:13,052
He stopped suddenly and looked curiously ather eager face.

2260
02:04:13,052 --> 02:04:18,095
"Why does tha' care so much about roses an'such, all of a sudden?" he demanded.

2261
02:04:18,095 --> 02:04:21,045
Mistress Mary felt her face grow red.

2262
02:04:21,045 --> 02:04:26,061
She was almost afraid to answer."I--I want to play that--that I have a

2263
02:04:26,061 --> 02:04:31,063
garden of my own," she stammered."I--there is nothing for me to do.

2264
02:04:31,063 --> 02:04:34,019
I have nothing--and no one."

2265
02:04:34,019 --> 02:04:38,061
"Well," said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as hewatched her, "that's true.

2266
02:04:38,061 --> 02:04:40,065
Tha' hasn't."

2267
02:04:40,065 --> 02:04:45,001
He said it in such an odd way that Marywondered if he was actually a little sorry

2268
02:04:45,001 --> 02:04:46,002
for her.

2269
02:04:46,002 --> 02:04:50,059
She had never felt sorry for herself; shehad only felt tired and cross, because she

2270
02:04:50,059 --> 02:04:55,008
disliked people and things so much.But now the world seemed to be changing and

2271
02:04:55,008 --> 02:04:56,053
getting nicer.

2272
02:04:56,053 --> 02:05:02,036
If no one found out about the secretgarden, she should enjoy herself always.

2273
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:05,091
She stayed with him for ten or fifteenminutes longer and asked him as many

2274
02:05:05,091 --> 02:05:07,085
questions as she dared.

2275
02:05:07,085 --> 02:05:11,095
He answered every one of them in his queergrunting way and he did not seem really

2276
02:05:11,095 --> 02:05:14,097
cross and did not pick up his spade andleave her.

2277
02:05:14,097 --> 02:05:19,029
He said something about roses just as shewas going away and it reminded her of the

2278
02:05:19,029 --> 02:05:24,039
ones he had said he had been fond of."Do you go and see those other roses now?"

2279
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:24,089
she asked.

2280
02:05:24,089 --> 02:05:28,065
"Not been this year.My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th'

2281
02:05:28,065 --> 02:05:29,083
joints."

2282
02:05:29,083 --> 02:05:33,086
He said it in his grumbling voice, and thenquite suddenly he seemed to get angry with

2283
02:05:33,086 --> 02:05:37,047
her, though she did not see why he should."Now look here!" he said sharply.

2284
02:05:37,047 --> 02:05:39,044
"Don't tha' ask so many questions.

2285
02:05:39,044 --> 02:05:43,015
Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questionsI've ever come a cross.

2286
02:05:43,015 --> 02:05:46,027
Get thee gone an' play thee.I've done talkin' for today."

2287
02:05:46,027 --> 02:05:50,015
And he said it so crossly that she knewthere was not the least use in staying

2288
02:05:50,015 --> 02:05:51,052
another minute.

2289
02:05:51,052 --> 02:05:56,006
She went skipping slowly down the outsidewalk, thinking him over and saying to

2290
02:05:56,006 --> 02:06:00,054
herself that, queer as it was, here wasanother person whom she liked in spite of

2291
02:06:00,054 --> 02:06:01,084
his crossness.

2292
02:06:01,084 --> 02:06:06,032
She liked old Ben Weatherstaff.Yes, she did like him.

2293
02:06:06,032 --> 02:06:09,039
She always wanted to try to make him talkto her.

2294
02:06:09,039 --> 02:06:13,093
Also she began to believe that he kneweverything in the world about flowers.

2295
02:06:13,093 --> 02:06:19,006
There was a laurel-hedged walk which curvedround the secret garden and ended at a gate

2296
02:06:19,006 --> 02:06:21,088
which opened into a wood, in the park.

2297
02:06:21,088 --> 02:06:25,004
She thought she would slip round this walkand look into the wood and see if there

2298
02:06:25,004 --> 02:06:27,002
were any rabbits hopping about.

2299
02:06:27,002 --> 02:06:31,079
She enjoyed the skipping very much and whenshe reached the little gate she opened it

2300
02:06:31,079 --> 02:06:36,064
and went through because she heard a low,peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find

2301
02:06:36,064 --> 02:06:37,078
out what it was.

2302
02:06:37,078 --> 02:06:42,049
It was a very strange thing indeed.She quite caught her breath as she stopped

2303
02:06:42,049 --> 02:06:42,093
to look at it.

2304
02:06:42,093 --> 02:06:48,077
A boy was sitting under a tree, with hisback against it, playing on a rough wooden

2305
02:06:48,077 --> 02:06:52,072
pipe.He was a funny looking boy about twelve.

2306
02:06:52,072 --> 02:06:56,095
He looked very clean and his nose turned upand his cheeks were as red as poppies and

2307
02:06:56,095 --> 02:07:02,047
never had Mistress Mary seen such round andsuch blue eyes in any boy's face.

2308
02:07:02,047 --> 02:07:06,043
And on the trunk of the tree he leanedagainst, a brown squirrel was clinging and

2309
02:07:06,043 --> 02:07:11,038
watching him, and from behind a bush nearbya cock pheasant was delicately stretching

2310
02:07:11,038 --> 02:07:14,061
his neck to peep out, and quite near him

2311
02:07:14,061 --> 02:07:19,078
were two rabbits sitting up and sniffingwith tremulous noses--and actually it

2312
02:07:19,078 --> 02:07:24,008
appeared as if they were all drawing nearto watch him and listen to the strange low

2313
02:07:24,008 --> 02:07:27,022
little call his pipe seemed to make.

2314
02:07:27,022 --> 02:07:32,079
When he saw Mary he held up his hand andspoke to her in a voice almost as low as

2315
02:07:32,079 --> 02:07:37,036
and rather like his piping."Don't tha' move," he said.

2316
02:07:37,036 --> 02:07:39,017
"It'd flight 'em."

2317
02:07:39,017 --> 02:07:43,046
Mary remained motionless.He stopped playing his pipe and began to

2318
02:07:43,046 --> 02:07:45,017
rise from the ground.

2319
02:07:45,017 --> 02:07:50,034
He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemedas though he were moving at all, but at

2320
02:07:50,034 --> 02:07:54,003
last he stood on his feet and then thesquirrel scampered back up into the

2321
02:07:54,003 --> 02:07:56,021
branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew

2322
02:07:56,021 --> 02:08:00,071
his head and the rabbits dropped on allfours and began to hop away, though not at

2323
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:04,058
all as if they were frightened."I'm Dickon," the boy said.

2324
02:08:04,058 --> 02:08:06,058
"I know tha'rt Miss Mary."

2325
02:08:06,058 --> 02:08:10,064
Then Mary realized that somehow she hadknown at first that he was Dickon.

2326
02:08:10,064 --> 02:08:14,068
Who else could have been charming rabbitsand pheasants as the natives charm snakes

2327
02:08:14,068 --> 02:08:16,011
in India?

2328
02:08:16,011 --> 02:08:20,022
He had a wide, red, curving mouth and hissmile spread all over his face.

2329
02:08:20,022 --> 02:08:26,051
"I got up slow," he explained, "because iftha' makes a quick move it startles 'em.

2330
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:31,068
A body 'as to move gentle an' speak lowwhen wild things is about."

2331
02:08:31,068 --> 02:08:35,016
He did not speak to her as if they hadnever seen each other before but as if he

2332
02:08:35,016 --> 02:08:36,076
knew her quite well.

2333
02:08:36,076 --> 02:08:41,004
Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoketo him a little stiffly because she felt

2334
02:08:41,004 --> 02:08:44,082
rather shy."Did you get Martha's letter?" she asked.

2335
02:08:44,082 --> 02:08:46,068
He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.

2336
02:08:46,068 --> 02:08:50,063
"That's why I come."He stooped to pick up something which had

2337
02:08:50,063 --> 02:08:53,002
been lying on the ground beside him when hepiped.

2338
02:08:53,002 --> 02:08:54,052
"I've got th' garden tools.

2339
02:08:54,052 --> 02:08:55,082
There's a little spade an' rake an' a forkan' hoe.

2340
02:08:55,082 --> 02:09:00,026
Eh! they are good 'uns.There's a trowel, too.

2341
02:09:00,026 --> 02:09:04,039
An' th' woman in th' shop threw in a packeto' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur

2342
02:09:04,039 --> 02:09:07,065
when I bought th' other seeds.""Will you show the seeds to me?"

2343
02:09:07,065 --> 02:09:08,079
Mary said.

2344
02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:12,097
She wished she could talk as he did.His speech was so quick and easy.

2345
02:09:12,097 --> 02:09:17,012
It sounded as if he liked her and was notthe least afraid she would not like him,

2346
02:09:17,012 --> 02:09:21,003
though he was only a common moor boy, inpatched clothes and with a funny face and a

2347
02:09:21,003 --> 02:09:22,066
rough, rusty-red head.

2348
02:09:22,066 --> 02:09:28,033
As she came closer to him she noticed thatthere was a clean fresh scent of heather

2349
02:09:28,033 --> 02:09:32,037
and grass and leaves about him, almost asif he were made of them.

2350
02:09:32,037 --> 02:09:37,002
She liked it very much and when she lookedinto his funny face with the red cheeks and

2351
02:09:37,002 --> 02:09:39,061
round blue eyes she forgot that she hadfelt shy.

2352
02:09:39,061 --> 02:09:43,066
"Let us sit down on this log and look atthem," she said.

2353
02:09:43,066 --> 02:09:48,046
They sat down and he took a clumsy littlebrown paper package out of his coat pocket.

2354
02:09:48,046 --> 02:09:53,039
He untied the string and inside there wereever so many neater and smaller packages

2355
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:57,087
with a picture of a flower on each one."There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,"

2356
02:09:57,087 --> 02:09:58,018
he said.

2357
02:09:58,018 --> 02:10:02,046
"Mignonette's th' sweetest smellin' thingas grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast

2358
02:10:02,046 --> 02:10:06,006
it, same as poppies will.Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just

2359
02:10:06,006 --> 02:10:08,053
whistle to 'em, them's th' nicest of all."

2360
02:10:08,053 --> 02:10:12,006
He stopped and turned his head quickly, hispoppy-cheeked face lighting up.

2361
02:10:12,006 --> 02:10:14,069
"Where's that robin as is callin' us?" hesaid.

2362
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:19,086
The chirp came from a thick holly bush,bright with scarlet berries, and Mary

2363
02:10:19,086 --> 02:10:23,008
thought she knew whose it was."Is it really calling us?" she asked.

2364
02:10:23,008 --> 02:10:28,004
"Aye," said Dickon, as if it was the mostnatural thing in the world, "he's callin'

2365
02:10:28,004 --> 02:10:32,000
some one he's friends with.That's same as sayin' 'Here I am.

2366
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:32,081
Look at me.

2367
02:10:32,081 --> 02:10:35,019
I wants a bit of a chat.'There he is in the bush.

2368
02:10:35,019 --> 02:10:38,079
Whose is he?""He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he

2369
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:40,093
knows me a little," answered Mary.

2370
02:10:40,093 --> 02:10:43,059
"Aye, he knows thee," said Dickon in hislow voice again.

2371
02:10:43,059 --> 02:10:45,091
"An' he likes thee.He's took thee on.

2372
02:10:45,091 --> 02:10:49,024
He'll tell me all about thee in a minute."

2373
02:10:49,024 --> 02:10:54,033
He moved quite close to the bush with theslow movement Mary had noticed before, and

2374
02:10:54,033 --> 02:10:57,071
then he made a sound almost like therobin's own twitter.

2375
02:10:57,071 --> 02:11:01,004
The robin listened a few seconds, intently,and then answered quite as if he were

2376
02:11:01,004 --> 02:11:05,006
replying to a question."Aye, he's a friend o' yours," chuckled

2377
02:11:05,006 --> 02:11:05,033
Dickon.

2378
02:11:05,033 --> 02:11:10,027
"Do you think he is?" cried Mary eagerly.She did so want to know.

2379
02:11:10,027 --> 02:11:13,071
"Do you think he really likes me?""He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,"

2380
02:11:13,071 --> 02:11:14,031
answered Dickon.

2381
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:19,003
"Birds is rare choosers an' a robin canflout a body worse than a man.

2382
02:11:19,003 --> 02:11:23,018
See, he's making up to thee now.'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'."

2383
02:11:23,018 --> 02:11:25,029
And it really seemed as if it must be true.

2384
02:11:25,029 --> 02:11:29,039
He so sidled and twittered and tilted as hehopped on his bush.

2385
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:32,085
"Do you understand everything birds say?"said Mary.

2386
02:11:32,085 --> 02:11:37,067
Dickon's grin spread until he seemed allwide, red, curving mouth, and he rubbed his

2387
02:11:37,067 --> 02:11:41,036
rough head."I think I do, and they think I do," he

2388
02:11:41,036 --> 02:11:41,036
said.

2389
02:11:41,036 --> 02:11:45,093
"I've lived on th' moor with 'em so long.I've watched 'em break shell an' come out

2390
02:11:45,093 --> 02:11:50,046
an' fledge an' learn to fly an' begin tosing, till I think I'm one of 'em.

2391
02:11:50,046 --> 02:11:54,063
Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or afox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a

2392
02:11:54,063 --> 02:11:58,085
beetle, an' I don't know it."He laughed and came back to the log and

2393
02:11:58,085 --> 02:12:01,057
began to talk about the flower seeds again.

2394
02:12:01,057 --> 02:12:04,095
He told her what they looked like when theywere flowers; he told her how to plant

2395
02:12:04,095 --> 02:12:07,067
them, and watch them, and feed and waterthem.

2396
02:12:07,067 --> 02:12:10,066
"See here," he said suddenly, turning roundto look at her.

2397
02:12:10,066 --> 02:12:14,039
"I'll plant them for thee myself.Where is tha' garden?"

2398
02:12:14,039 --> 02:12:18,023
Mary's thin hands clutched each other asthey lay on her lap.

2399
02:12:18,023 --> 02:12:22,015
She did not know what to say, so for awhole minute she said nothing.

2400
02:12:22,015 --> 02:12:23,069
She had never thought of this.

2401
02:12:23,069 --> 02:12:27,083
She felt miserable.And she felt as if she went red and then

2402
02:12:27,083 --> 02:12:30,096
pale."Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?"

2403
02:12:30,096 --> 02:12:32,034
Dickon said.

2404
02:12:32,034 --> 02:12:34,088
It was true that she had turned red andthen pale.

2405
02:12:34,088 --> 02:12:39,005
Dickon saw her do it, and as she still saidnothing, he began to be puzzled.

2406
02:12:39,005 --> 02:12:41,054
"Wouldn't they give thee a bit?" he asked.

2407
02:12:41,054 --> 02:12:46,017
"Hasn't tha' got any yet?"She held her hands tighter and turned her

2408
02:12:46,017 --> 02:12:49,088
eyes toward him."I don't know anything about boys," she

2409
02:12:49,088 --> 02:12:51,023
said slowly.

2410
02:12:51,023 --> 02:12:53,029
"Could you keep a secret, if I told youone?

2411
02:12:53,029 --> 02:12:56,009
It's a great secret.I don't know what I should do if any one

2412
02:12:56,009 --> 02:12:58,017
found it out.

2413
02:12:58,017 --> 02:13:03,043
I believe I should die!"She said the last sentence quite fiercely.

2414
02:13:03,043 --> 02:13:06,092
Dickon looked more puzzled than ever andeven rubbed his hand over his rough head

2415
02:13:06,092 --> 02:13:09,063
again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.

2416
02:13:09,063 --> 02:13:12,013
"I'm keepin' secrets all th' time," hesaid.

2417
02:13:12,013 --> 02:13:16,007
"If I couldn't keep secrets from th' otherlads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds'

2418
02:13:16,007 --> 02:13:21,009
nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd benaught safe on th' moor.

2419
02:13:21,009 --> 02:13:23,032
Aye, I can keep secrets."

2420
02:13:23,032 --> 02:13:27,087
Mistress Mary did not mean to put out herhand and clutch his sleeve but she did it.

2421
02:13:27,087 --> 02:13:31,061
"I've stolen a garden," she said very fast."It isn't mine.

2422
02:13:31,061 --> 02:13:32,054
It isn't anybody's.

2423
02:13:32,054 --> 02:13:36,025
Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it,nobody ever goes into it.

2424
02:13:36,025 --> 02:13:39,035
Perhaps everything is dead in it already.I don't know."

2425
02:13:39,035 --> 02:13:43,056
She began to feel hot and as contrary asshe had ever felt in her life.

2426
02:13:43,056 --> 02:13:47,021
"I don't care, I don't care!Nobody has any right to take it from me

2427
02:13:47,021 --> 02:13:49,015
when I care about it and they don't.

2428
02:13:49,015 --> 02:13:53,008
They're letting it die, all shut in byitself," she ended passionately, and she

2429
02:13:53,008 --> 02:13:58,019
threw her arms over her face and burst outcrying-poor little Mistress Mary.

2430
02:13:58,019 --> 02:14:03,003
Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder androunder.

2431
02:14:03,003 --> 02:14:09,001
"Eh-h-h!" he said, drawing his exclamationout slowly, and the way he did it meant

2432
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:10,093
both wonder and sympathy.

2433
02:14:10,093 --> 02:14:15,015
"I've nothing to do," said Mary."Nothing belongs to me.

2434
02:14:15,015 --> 02:14:20,015
I found it myself and I got into it myself.I was only just like the robin, and they

2435
02:14:20,015 --> 02:14:21,054
wouldn't take it from the robin."

2436
02:14:21,054 --> 02:14:25,006
"Where is it?" asked Dickon in a droppedvoice.

2437
02:14:25,006 --> 02:14:29,007
Mistress Mary got up from the log at once.She knew she felt contrary again, and

2438
02:14:29,007 --> 02:14:32,039
obstinate, and she did not care at all.

2439
02:14:32,039 --> 02:14:36,063
She was imperious and Indian, and at thesame time hot and sorrowful.

2440
02:14:36,063 --> 02:14:41,023
"Come with me and I'll show you," she said.She led him round the laurel path and to

2441
02:14:41,023 --> 02:14:43,068
the walk where the ivy grew so thickly.

2442
02:14:43,068 --> 02:14:47,072
Dickon followed her with a queer, almostpitying, look on his face.

2443
02:14:47,072 --> 02:14:52,056
He felt as if he were being led to look atsome strange bird's nest and must move

2444
02:14:52,056 --> 02:14:54,013
softly.

2445
02:14:54,013 --> 02:14:57,088
When she stepped to the wall and lifted thehanging ivy he started.

2446
02:14:57,088 --> 02:15:03,022
There was a door and Mary pushed it slowlyopen and they passed in together, and then

2447
02:15:03,022 --> 02:15:05,078
Mary stood and waved her hand rounddefiantly.

2448
02:15:05,078 --> 02:15:07,073
"It's this," she said.

2449
02:15:07,073 --> 02:15:13,003
"It's a secret garden, and I'm the only onein the world who wants it to be alive."

2450
02:15:13,003 --> 02:15:16,098
Dickon looked round and round about it, andround and round again.

2451
02:15:16,098 --> 02:15:23,028
"Eh!" he almost whispered, "it is a queer,pretty place!

2452
02:15:23,028 --> 02:15:29,005
It's like as if a body was in a dream."

2453
02:15:29,005 --> 99:59:59,999

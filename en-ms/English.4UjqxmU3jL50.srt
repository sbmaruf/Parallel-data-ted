1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:08,090
We're asked to divide 99.061,
or 99 and 61/1000, by 100.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,470
And there's a few ways to do it.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,420
But what I want to
do in this video

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,760
is focus on kind of a faster
way to think about it.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,340
And hopefully it'll
make sense to you.

6
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:16,993
And that's also the focus of
it, that it makes sense to you.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,170
So 99, let's just think
about it a little bit.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,570
So if we-- so 99.061.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,000
So if we were to
divide this by 10, just

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,550
to make the point clear, if
we were to divide this by 10,

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,920
what would we get?

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,210
Well, we would essentially
move the decimal place one spot

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,570
to the left.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,690
And it should make sense because
we have a little over 99.

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,940
If you took 99
divided by 10, you

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,990
should have a little over 9.

17
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,550
So essentially, you would
move the decimal place one

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,760
to the left when
you divide by 10.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,710
So this would be
equal to 9.9061.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,150
If you were to divide it
by 100, which is actually

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,270
the focus of this problem, so
if we divide 99.061 divided

22
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,269
by 100, if we move the decimal
place once to the left,

23
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,210
we're dividing by 10.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,470
To divide it by 100, we
have to divide by 10 again.

25
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,760
So we move it over twice.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,980
So one, two times.

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,790
And so now the decimal place
is out in front of that first

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,250
leading 9, which also
should make sense.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,440
99 is almost 100, or a
little bit less than 100.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,420
So if you divide it
by 100, we should

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,830
be a little bit less than 1.

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,640
And so if you move the
decimal place two places over

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,050
to the left, because we're
really dividing by 10 twice,

34
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,640
if you want to think
of it that way,

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,870
we will get the decimal in
front of the 99-- 0.99061.

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,120
We should put a zero out here.

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,340
Just sometimes it
clarifies things.

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,100
So then we get this
right over here.

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, one way to think
about it, although I do

40
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:54,616
want you to always imagine that
when you move the decimal place

41
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,520
over to the left, you really are
dividing by 10 when you move it

42
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:58,135
to the left.

43
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,070
When you move it to the right,
you're multiplying by 10.

44
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,200
Sometimes people
say, hey, look, you

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,300
could just count the
number of zeroes.

46
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,160
And if you're dividing, so over
here, you were dividing by 100.

47
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:13,986
100 has two zeroes, and
we're dividing by it,

48
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,100
so we could move our decimal
two spaces to the left.

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,300
That's all right to do
that, especially it's

50
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,730
kind of a fast way to do it.

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,200
If this had 20 zeroes,
you would immediately

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,700
say, OK, let's move the
decimal 20 places to the left.

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,650
But I really want you to think
about why that's working,

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,080
why that makes sense,
why it's giving you

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,430
a number that seems to be the
right kind of size number,

56
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,710
why it makes sense that if
you take something that's

57
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,580
almost 100 and
divide by 100, you'll

58
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,140
get something that's almost 1.

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,880
And that part, frankly, is just
a really good reality check

60
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,440
to make sure you're going
in the right direction

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,170
with the decimal.

62
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,980
Because if you tried
this 5, 10 years

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,410
from now, maybe your
memory of the rule

64
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:58,276
or whatever you want to
call it for doing it,

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,110
you're like hey, wait,
do I move the decimal

66
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,163
to the left or the right?

67
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:03,622
It's really good to do that
reality check to say, OK, look,

68
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,120
If I'm dividing by 100, I should
be getting a smaller value

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,940
and moving the
decimal to the left

70
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,620
gives me that smaller value.

71
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,600
If I was multiplying by 100,
I should get a larger value.

72
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,062
And moving the
decimal to the right

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,860
would give you
that larger value.

Today I'm going to show you how to make a mini indoor bow and arrow.

2
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:09,666
Start by taking a lolly pop stick, putting it in a bowl of water

3
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,195
And leaving it to soak for half an hour.

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,804
Next dry it off, then using a small pair of scissors or nail clippers

5
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,009
Cut two small grooves at each end of the stick.

6
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:23,204
It should look like this.

7
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:25,021
Next take a short length of dental floss

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:29,923
Wrap it around the grooves at one end of the stick, and tie it on.

9
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:33,879
Then we need to gently bend the stick into a bow shape

10
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,927
Wrap the floss around the grooves at the other end, tie it on with a knot

11
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,213
And cut the end off using scissors.

12
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:44,068
And there we have it, our completed bow.

13
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:48,548
If you want to customise your bow, use a ball point pen to draw a design on

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,085
before you bend it into shape.

15
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:54,027
To make the arrows, we're going to use a cotton bud

16
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:57,635
And cut the end off using a pair of scissors.

17
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:03,421
Firing it takes a little bit of practice, but you soon pick it up, and its safe to use indoors.

18
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:08,099
If you want to make a flaming arrow, first you need to reinforce the cotton bud tube

19
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,195
With a shaved down cocktail stick.

20
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,246
Otherwise the plastic arrow melts and the cotton bud falls off.

21
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:16,884
Next roll the cotton in some Vaseline

22
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:21,407
Get it into position ready to fire, and light the arrow.

23
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:24,361
The arrow will stay alight long after its landed

24
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:27,641
So you should only do this outside, somewhere safe where nothing can catch fire

25
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:30,435
And keep some water on standby to put it out.

26
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,495

28

Happy shooting, stay safe and as always, thanks for watching.

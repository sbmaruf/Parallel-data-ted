1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,790
Use a number line to
compare 11.5 and 11.7.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,630
So let's draw a
number line here.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,310
And I'm going to focus
between 11 and 12,

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,430
because that's where our
two numbers are sitting.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,550
They're 11, and then something
else, some number of 10ths.

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,390
So this right here is 11.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,700
And this right here would be 12.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,710
And then let me draw the 10ths.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,970
So this would be
smack dab in between.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,190
So that would be 11 and
5/10, or that would be 11.5.

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,150
Well, I've already
done the first part.

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,090
I've figured out where 11.5 is.

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,720
It's smack dab in
between 11 and 12.

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,907
It's 11 and 5/10.

16
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:38,240
But let me find everything else.

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,240
Let me mark everything
else on this number line.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,200
So that's 1/10, 2/10, 3/10,
4/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10, 8/10,

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,622
9/10, and then 10/10,
right on the 12.

20
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:52,080
It's not completely
drawn to scale.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,621
I'm hand-drawing it
as good as I can.

22
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,510
So where is 11.7 going to be?

23
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,676
Well, this is 11.5, this
is 11.6, this is 11.7.

24
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:01,970
11 and 7/10.

25
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,450
1/10, 2/10, 3/10,
4/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10.

26
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,110
This is 11.7.

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,900
And the way we've
drawn our number line,

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,370
we are increasing as
we go to the right.

29
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,980
11.7 is to the right of 11.5.

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,510
It's clearly greater than 11.5.

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,920
11.7 is greater than 11.5.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,870
And really,
seriously, you didn't

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,200
have to draw a number
line to figure that out.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,260
They're both 11
and something else.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,650
This is 11 and 5/10.

36
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,780
This is 11 and 7/10.

37
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,330
So clearly, this one
is going to be greater.

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,462
You both have 11, but this
has 7/10, as opposed to 5/10.

39
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:38,962

1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:02,863
Let's say that I have five lemons

2
00:00:02,867 --> 00:00:07,127
so that's [counting to five] ... five lemons

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:12,239
and I were to ask you: what do I have to multiply times five to get one?

4
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:16,978
or in this case: what do I have to multiply times five lemons to get one lemon?

5
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:19,464
and so, another question you might ask

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,816
because really multiplication and division are two sides of the same coin

7
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:23,312
is

8
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:27,302
what do I have to divide five by to get to one lemon

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,120
or yellow circle, or whatever I have drawn right over here

10
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:35,136
Well, if you have five things and you divide by five, you're gonna have five groups of one

11
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:39,632
so if you divide by five, you're gonna have [counting to five] ... five groups

12
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:44,146
So you could say five divided by five is equal to one

13
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:49,401
take five things and divide it into five groups then each group is going to have one in them

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,860
or you could say five times one fifth is equal to one

15
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,925
(and I use the dot for multiplication)

16
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,769
I could also say five times one fifth is equal to one

17
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,627
these are all really saying the same thing

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,471
Maybe what's kind of interesting here

19
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,127
(although it's not some huge learning)

20
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:12,938
it's really just another way of writing what you already probably know,

21
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:19,463
is this idea that if I have a number and I multiply times it's multiplicative inverse

22
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:22,537
(and most of the time when people talk about inverses in mathematics

23
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,633
they are talking about the multiplicative inverse)

24
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:26,467
then I'm going to get one

25
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:28,575
so five time one fifth is equal to one

26
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:34,389
but that's just because five times one fifth is the same thing as five divided by five

27
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:35,969
if you were to actually multiply this out

28
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:38,478
you actually take five times one fifth

29
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:44,656
this is equal to five-over-one times one-over-five

30
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:47,402
you multiply the numerators: five times one is five

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,130
multiply the denominators: one times five is five

32
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:56,633
so you have five fifths, and five fifths is the exact same thing as one

33
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,444
So if someone where to ask you a question,

34
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:01,785
they say "Hey, I have the number 217

35
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:07,539
and I want to multiply it by something, and I want to get one after multiplying it by that something"

36
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:12,475
Well then you say - Well look, If I took 217 and divided it by 217 that would get me to one

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,760
and dividing by 217 is the exact same thing as multiplying by one-over-217

38
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:22,351
multiplying by its multiplicative inverse

39
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:25,868
which is, once again, a word that is fancier than the actual concept

40
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,327
you are just multiplying by the inverse of this number

41
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:29,523
Another way to think about it is

42
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,009
if I have five things and I take one fifth of those things, how many things do I have?

43
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:39,775
Well, if I take one fifth of five things I have exactly one thing right over here

44
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,377
But the general idea is super-duper-duper simple

45
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:47,317
if I have some crazy number ... 8,345

46
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,458
that's actually not so crazy, let's turn it to something in the millions

47
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,068
... and 271 ...

48
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:52,646
so

49
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:55,505
8,345,271

50
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,652
And I say, what do I have to multiply by

51
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,647
(and now I use this multiplication symbol right now)

52
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:03,462
what do I have to multiply that by in order to get one?

53
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:05,971
I just have to multiply it by the inverse of this

54
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,139
the multiplicative inverse of this

55
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:16,198
so one-over-8,345,271

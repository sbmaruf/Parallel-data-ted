1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,880
The circle is arguably the most
fundamental shape in our

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,490
universe, whether you look at
the shapes of orbits of

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,140
planets, whether you look at
wheels, whether you look at

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,840
things on kind of a
molecular level.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,860
The circle just keeps
showing up over and

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,350
over and over again.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,110
So it's probably worthwhile for
us to understand some of the

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,330
properties of the circle.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,200
So the first thing when people
kind of discovered the circle,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,960
and you just have a look at the
moon to see a circle, but the

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,570
first time they said well, what
are the properties

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,910
of any circle?

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,150
So the first one they might
want to say is well, a circle

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,690
is all of the points that are
equal distant from the

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,440
center of the circle.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,710
All of these points along the
edge are equal distant from

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,210
that center right there.

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,620
So one of the first things
someone might want to ask is

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,280
what is that distance, that
equal distance that everything

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,770
is from the center?

21
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,950
Right there.

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,110
We call that the
radius of the circle.

23
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,350
It's just the distance from
the center out to the edge.

24
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,820
If that radius is 3
centimeters, then this radius

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,490
is going to be 3 centimeters.

26
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,170
And this radius is going
to be 3 centimeters.

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,270
It's never going to change.

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,690
By definition, a circle is all
of the points that are equal

29
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,400
distant from the center point.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,050
And that distance
is the radius.

31
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,880
Now the next most interesting
thing about that, people might

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,040
say well, how fat
is the circle?

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,360
How wide is it along
its widest point?

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,710
Or if you just want to cut it
along its widest point, what

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,390
is that distance right there?

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,340
And it doesn't have to be just
right there, I could have just

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,490
as easily cut it along its
widest point right there.

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,520
I just wouldn't be cutting it
like some place like that

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,120
because that wouldn't be
along its widest point.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,810
There's multiple places
where I could cut it

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,480
along its widest point.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,730
Well, we just saw the radius
and we see that widest point

43
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,580
goes through the center
and just keeps going.

44
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,920
So it's essentially two radii.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,640
You got one radius there
and then you have another

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,240
radius over there.

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,380
We call this distance along
the widest point of the

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,030
circle, the diameter.

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,390
So that is the diameter
of the circle.

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,260
It has a very easy
relationship with the radius.

51
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:16,155
The diameter is equal to
two times the radius.

52
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,790
Now, the next most interesting
thing that you might be

53
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,560
wondering about a circle is how
far is it around the circle?

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,340
So if you were to get your tape
measure out and you were to

55
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:35,910
measure around the circle like
that, what's that distance?

56
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:44,710
We call that word the
circumference of the circle.

57
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,440
Now, we know how the diameter
and the radius relates, but how

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,790
does the circumference relate
to, say, the diameter.

59
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,550
And if you're not really used
to the diameter, it's very

60
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,290
easy to figure out how it
relates to the radius.

61
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,130
Well, many thousands of years
ago, people took their tape

62
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,890
measures out and they keep
measuring circumferences

63
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,430
and radiuses.

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,280
And let's say when their tape
measures weren't so good,

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,010
let's say they measured the
circumference of the circle

66
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,960
and they would get well, it
looks like it's about 3.

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,600
And then they measure the
radius of the circle right here

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,280
or the diameter of that circle,
and they'd say oh, the diameter

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,290
looks like it's about 1.

70
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,740
So they would say -- let
me write this down.

71
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,750
So we're worried about
the ratio -- let me

72
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,660
write it like this.

73
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:33,955
The ratio of the circumference
to the diameter.

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,900
So let's say that somebody had
some circle over here -- let's

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,170
say they had this circle, and
the first time with not that

76
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,880
good of a tape measure, they
measured around the circle

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,340
and they said hey, it's
roughly equal to 3 meters

78
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,490
when I go around it.

79
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,800
And when I measure the
diameter of the circle,

80
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,050
it's roughly equal to 1.

81
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,000
OK, that's interesting.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Maybe the ratio of
the circumference of

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,500
the diameter's 3.

84
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,820
So maybe the circumference
is always three

85
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,020
times the diameter.

86
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,610
Well that was just for this
circle, but let's say they

87
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,720
measured some other
circle here.

88
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,870
It's like this -- I
drew it smaller.

89
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,200
Let's say that on this circle
they measured around it and

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,960
they found out that the
circumference is 6 centimeters,

91
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,210
roughly -- we have a bad
tape measure right then.

92
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,710
Then they find out
that the diameter is

93
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,520
roughly 2 centimeters.

94
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,490
And once again, the ratio of
the circumference of the

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,230
diameter was roughly 3.

96
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,140
OK, this is a neat
property of circles.

97
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,430
Maybe the ratio of the
circumference to the diameters

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,080
always fixed for any circle.

99
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,260
So they said let me
study this further.

100
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,510
So they got better
tape measures.

101
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,090
When they got better tape
measures, they measured hey,

102
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,630
my diameter's definitely 1.

103
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,430
They say my diameter's
definitely 1, but when I

104
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,810
measure my circumference
a little bit, I realize

105
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,040
it's closer to 3.1.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,290
And the same thing
with this over here.

107
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,370
They notice that this
ratio is closer to 3.1.

108
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,830
Then they kept measuring it
better and better and better,

109
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,200
and then they realized that
they were getting this number,

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
they just kept measuring it
better and better and they were

111
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,850
getting this number 3.14159.

112
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,550
And they just kept adding
digits and it would

113
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,620
never repeat.

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,640
It was a strange fascinating
metaphysical number

115
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,300
that kept showing up.

116
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,940
So since this number was so
fundamental to our universe,

117
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,500
because the circle is so
fundamental to our universe,

118
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,680
and it just showed up
for every circle.

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,865
The ratio of the circumference
of the diameter was this

120
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:32,390
kind of magical number,
they gave it a name.

121
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,580
They called it pi, or you could
just give it the Latin or the

122
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,880
Greek letter pi --
just like that.

123
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,090
That represents this number
which is arguably the most

124
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,790
fascinating number
in our universe.

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,430
It first shows up as the ratio
of the circumference to the

126
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,070
diameter, but you're going to
learn as you go through your

127
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,160
mathematical journey, that
it shows up everywhere.

128
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,500
It's one of these fundamental
things about the universe that

129
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,060
just makes you think that
there's some order to it.

130
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,750
But anyway, how can we
use this in I guess

131
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,330
our basic mathematics?

132
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,490
So we know, or I'm telling you,
that the ratio of the

133
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,420
circumference to the diameter
-- when I say the ratio,

134
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,390
literally I'm just saying if
you divide the circumference by

135
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:28,400
the diameter, you're
going to get pi.

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,500
Pi is just this number.

137
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,570
I could write 3.14159 and just
keep going on and on and on,

138
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,950
but that would be a waste of
space and it would just be hard

139
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,570
to deal with, so people just
write this Greek

140
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,330
letter pi there.

141
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,850
So, how can we relate this?

142
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,920
We can multiply both sides of
this by the diameter and we

143
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,640
could say that the
circumference is equal to pi

144
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,820
times the diameter.

145
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,570
Or since the diameter is equal
to 2 times the radius, we could

146
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,420
say that the circumference is
equal to pi times 2

147
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,360
times the radius.

148
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,450
Or the form that you're
most likely to see it,

149
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,360
it's equal to 2 pi r.

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,220
So let's see if we can apply
that to some problems.

151
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,240
So let's say I have a circle
just like that, and I were to

152
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,600
tell you it has a radius --
it's radius right there is 3.

153
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,820
So, 3 -- let me write this down
-- so the radius is equal to 3.

154
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,310
Maybe it's 3 meters --
put some units in there.

155
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,660
What is the circumference
of the circle?

156
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,180
The circumference is equal to
2 times pi times the radius.

157
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,090
So it's going to be equal to 2
times pi times the radius,

158
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,280
times 3 meters, which is
equal to 6 meters times

159
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
pi or 6 pi meters.

160
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,430
6 pi meters.

161
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,740
Now I could multiply this out.

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,900
Remember pi is just a number.

163
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,680
Pi is 3.14159 going
on and on and on.

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,460
So if I multiply 6 times that,
maybe I'll get 18 point

165
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,600
something something something.

166
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,850
If you have your calculator you
might want to do it, but for

167
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,490
simplicity people just tend to
leave our numbers

168
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,120
in terms of pi.

169
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,020
Now I don't know what this is
if you multiply 6 times

170
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,510
3.14159, I don't know if you
get something close to 19 or

171
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,910
18, maybe it's approximately
18 point something

172
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,720
something something.

173
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,450
I don't have my calculator
in front of me.

174
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,300
But instead of writing
that number, you just

175
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,060
write 6 pi there.

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,770
Actually, I think it
wouldn't quite cross the

177
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,430
threshold to 19 yet.

178
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,770
Now, let's ask
another question.

179
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,270
What is the diameter
of the circle?

180
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,690
Well if this radius is 3, the
diameter is just twice that.

181
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,730
So it's just going to be 3
times 2 or 3 plus 3, which

182
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,170
is equal to 6 meters.

183
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,750
So the circumference is 6 pi
meters, the diameter is 6

184
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,620
meters, the radius is 3 meters.

185
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,110
Now let's go the other way.

186
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,310
Let's say I have
another circle.

187
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,220
Let's say I have
another circle here.

188
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,620
And I were to tell you that
its circumference is equal

189
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,560
to 10 meters -- that's the
circumference of the circle.

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,990
If you were to put a tape
measure to go around it and

191
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:18,370
someone were to ask you what is
the diameter of the circle?

192
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,810
Well, we know that the diameter
times pi, we know that pi times

193
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,830
the diameter is equal to
the circumference; is

194
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,700
equal to 10 meters.

195
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,020
So to solve for this we would
just divide both sides

196
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,520
of this equation by pi.

197
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,860
The diameter would equal
10 meters over pi or

198
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,710
10 over pi meters.

199
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,020
And that is just a number.

200
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,540
If you have your calculator,
you could actually divide 10

201
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,030
divided by 3.14159, you're
going to get 3 point something

202
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,500
something something meters.

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,960
I can't do it in my head.

204
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,070
But this is just a number.

205
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,320
But for simplicity we often
just leave it that way.

206
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,270
Now what is the radius?

207
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,590
Well, the radius is equal
to 1/2 the diameter.

208
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,870
So this whole distance right
here is 10 over pi meters.

209
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,230
If we just 1/2 of that, if
we just want the radius, we

210
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,580
just multiply it times 1/2.

211
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,160
So you have 1/2 times 10 over
pi, which is equal to 1/2 times

212
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,770
10, or you just divide the
numerator and the

213
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,140
denominator by 2.

214
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,130
You get 5 there, so
you get 5 over pi.

215
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,890
So the radius over
here is 5 over pi.

216
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,690
Nothing super fancy about this.

217
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,760
I think the thing that confuses
people the most is to just

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,820
realize that pi is a number.

219
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,640
Pi is just 3.14159 and it just
keeps going on and on and on.

220
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,950
There's actually thousands of
books written about pi, so

221
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,100
it's not like -- I don't know
if there's thousands, I'm

222
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,340
exaggerating, but you could
write books about this number.

223
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
But it's just a number.

224
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,480
It's a very special number, and
if you wanted to write it in a

225
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,390
way that you're used to writing
numbers, you could literally

226
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,680
just multiply this out.

227
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,530
But most the time people just
realize they like leaving

228
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,640
things in terms of pi.

229
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

230
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,090
In the next video we'll figure
out the area of a circle.

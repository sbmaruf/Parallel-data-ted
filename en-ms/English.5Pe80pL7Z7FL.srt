1
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,897
Man Ok, we're home!

2
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:08,434
Ah! Did she still not find it?

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,486
What is the problem?

4
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:13,483
See... that is...

5
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:17,278
That is… I believe that Stylist Jang lost a watch.

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,668
Watch?

7
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,008
Which watch?

8
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:26,246
The watch that was sponsored this time.

9
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:29,965
Ha! She made such a big deal asking us to keep it safely,

10
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,812
How could she lose that?

11
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:45,302
Hey, Jang Man Ok, are you crazy...?

12
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:55,129
Hey! Why the heck are you shouting?

13
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:57,184
I heard you lost the watch?!

14
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:59,119
Are you insane?

15
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,009
Watch? What kind of watch?

16
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,246
The watch that was sponsored?

17
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,003
Do you know how much that thing costs?

18
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,624
Even your lifetime salary will not be enough.

19
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:11,665
Ah! Be quiet.

20
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,915
Man Ok, what happened? Where and when did you lose it?

21
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:19,157
That is… Earlier, when I was chasing after you, Kang Hwi…

22
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:21,645
Then, I came back to the make-up room . . .

23
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,281
The watch… wasn’t there.

24
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,416
Great going!

25
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,407
It hasn’t even been long since you started your job as a stylist!

26
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:28,947
And, you end up losing a watch that is sponsored?!

27
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:32,464
If you don’t find it, you’ll have to pay for watch. What are you going to do now?

28
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,754
Are you adding oil to fire now?

29
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,017
Hey, you may go first.Please leave now.

30
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:40,941
You know that if you don’t resolve this properly, you are out immediately, right?

31
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,829
Sty-list Jang!

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,434
I will definitely find it! Everything will be fine if I find it.

33
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:49,963
How? Do you think the watch will appear if you cry like this here?

34
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:55,248
If you sit and cry, will someone solve it for you instead?

35
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,519
You said you were a pro?!

36
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,341
Ah! Please! Give it a break!

37
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:06,573
I told you to get out!

38
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:10,555
Clean this all up.

39
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:13,436
I definitely have to find the watch.<br />I'll find it.

40
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:17,218
That’s right, Man Ok. I will also help you.

41
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:21,288
Anyway, that guy, I don’t like everything about him from head to toe.

42
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:28,343
Especially that mouth! I like that mouth the least!

43
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:31,557
What did I do? <br />Did I say something wrong?

44
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:40,047
This is my chance to get her fired and I will not see her ever again!

45
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,778
What is this? You hadn’t left yet?

46
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,116
Because of this.

47
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:46,211
What is that?

48
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:48,927
The cat pajamas you got at the fan meeting.

49
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:52,267
I packed it and brought it, but I didn’t know what to do with it.

50
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:56,015
Get rid of this.

51
00:02:56,015 --> 00:03:01,109
I thought it wouldn’t be possible because of your allergies.

52
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,007
Then… is it alright if I give it Kang Hwi hyung?

53
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,659
He asked me to give it to him earlier.

54
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,007
That’s alright. Leave it in the basement.

55
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:09,073
In the basement?

56
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:12,279
Yes! the basement!

57
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:17,565
Okay.

58
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,558
Thank you, Kang Hwi!

59
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,072
Go back in quickly.

60
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,537
No, I’ll drop you off.

61
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:32,782
Oh! It’ll be the first time you’re riding my car. <Br>My car is really nice.

62
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:40,346
Let’s go.

63
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:50,411
What is this?Are they dating?

64
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,771
<i>Episode 4~Part 1~</i>

65
00:03:53,771 --> 00:04:09,842
She still hasn’t come back? Is there really a problem?

66
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:16,732
Sorry, my friend.

67
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:24,111
Uh? It’s the same car as my oppa’s.

68
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:28,143
Today, don't think about anything, just rest.

69
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,928
Thank you, Kang Hwi.

70
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,584
You’re going to the shop tomorrow, right?

71
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:33,721
I must. By finding it somehow…

72
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:36,079
Call when you go, I’ll go with you.

73
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,258
No, I can go alone.

74
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:39,096
I don't have anything scheduled.

75
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:42,176
I was going to go shopping tomorrow anyway.

76
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,557
It’s a good thing, go with me.

77
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:46,724
See… Kang Hwi, you needn’t.

78
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:50,217
Go inside, I'm going.

79
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:51,751
Please go back carefully.

80
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,852
Yes.

81
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:58,148
Forget about the watch for now and sleep tight, alright?

82
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:17,478
Yes.

83
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:20,989
What was that all about? Spill the truth!

84
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:27,661
The guy just now, he wouldn’t be… my Kang Hwi oppa, right?

85
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:36,014
It's true, it's your oppa.

86
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:38,044
Hey! Don’t joke around with me and tell me the truth.

87
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:40,505
Did you come together with my oppa?

88
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:44,048
Ah! You said you saw everything. He is indeed your oppa!

89
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:47,003
Why? How could he be my oppa?

90
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:51,058
How can a commoner like you be with my oppa?

91
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:55,087
Don’t leave anything out and tell me clearly, in detail.

92
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,942
And in detail, so that I can comprehend the situation!

93
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,798
I am the stylist for Take One.

94
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,342
Stylist?

95
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:06,039
You? How?

96
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,061
It just happened somehow.

97
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,069
Ah! You’re frustrating. Tell me properly!

98
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,768
Later… let’s talk later.I’m really tired now. Go now.

99
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:16,113
When later? Jang Man Ok...

100
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,203
I’m feeling immensely betrayed by you!

101
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,766
You see Kang Hwi oppa’s face every day.<br />How could you not say a word about it? Huh?

102
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:24,483
It’s not been too long since I started… and I was out of my mind.

103
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,067
Still, this is such an important thing!

104
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,023
Mom and I didn’t even know that...

105
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:32,623
And we were so worried that you might be suffering somewhere…

106
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:37,006
For someone who said she worried, <br />how could you not call even once?

107
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:40,956
That... I did that all for you.

108
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:48,033
Then, for me, please leave. Huh?<br /> Let me get some sleep!

109
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,087
Jang Man Ok!

110
00:06:50,087 --> 00:07:04,876
Hey! Jang Man Ok!

111
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,887
<i>Pain in the Ass For My Entire Life

00:07:52,491 --> 00:08:08,248
What more has come up?

115
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:23,506
<i>Tae Ik oppa said that he will take a commemoration photo in the pajamas and put it up on the fan café. I’m so looking forward to it.</i>

116
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:51,522
I will just take one photo… Just one…

117
00:08:51,522 --> 00:09:02,035
<i>First, give me the watches.

118
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:14,309
Then this…

119
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:18,144
She turns her phone off in this situation?

120
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:31,816
Ah! I don’t know, I don’t know… it isn’t even my business.

121
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:34,773
What is this? What is this guy?

122
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:38,089
How can he call all night long?

123
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,999
Wow! He sent a text at 3 a.m. and at dawn?

124
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,688
<i>How dare you turn off your cell?

127
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:53,481
Ah! Seriously! This rude bastard! What does he want to make me do now?

128
00:09:53,481 --> 00:10:00,043
I'm very sorry, but today I am very busy.

129
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:02,711
I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

130
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,393
I requested so much, but if you do this, it is problematic.

131
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:09,123
Can’t you wait just one more day, please? Just one more day!

132
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,235
Instead, if you can’t return it by tomorrow,

133
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,593
you must take the responsibility and compensate for it.

134
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:18,079
Thank you. Thank you very much.

135
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,977
But can you find it?

136
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,961
It is such an expensive product that if someone saw it,<br />he would have taken it immediately.

137
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:28,385
I must find it somehow.

138
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:31,028
But… if...

139
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:34,666
What if the watch can't be found, how much does it cost?

140
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,106
You can pay for its actual cost.

141
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,017
$30,000.

142
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:40,335
$30,000?

143
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,164
Shh, keep quiet!

144
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:44,012
Oh my god.

145
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:46,001
How can a watch be that expensive?

146
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,581
I already told you.

147
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,764
It is an highly-priced watch that normal people don’t even get to see.

148
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,853
That…

149
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:58,755
I will buy that watch.

150
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:03,541
I will pay for the watch.

151
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,044
Are you crazy?

152
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,912
Why? I earn a lot of money.

153
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,289
I can pay for that.

154
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,191
Still, this isn’t right.

155
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,745
What?

156
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,371
I was at fault. Why would you pay for it instead?

157
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,908
It’s weird.

158
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,938
There’s nothing weird about it.

159
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,456
If you think about it, I’m also at fault.

160
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:24,013
If I hadn’t joked around back then, you wouldn’t have vacated the waiting area.

161
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,925
Then you wouldn’t have lost the watch.

162
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:28,483
So, I’m also at fault.

163
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,714
Anyway, it is my responsibility, so I will take care of it.

164
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:34,091
Don’t bother about it, Kang Hwi.

165
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,687
Why? I want to help.

166
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:39,886
Strangely, Man Ok, you seem familiar.

167
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,143
You even saved me when we first met.

168
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:43,601
Ah… that was…

169
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:47,572
You don’t know this, right? You look exactly like the girl I used to like.

170
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:50,763
What? Me?

171
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:57,372
Yes. You look exactly like my first love.

172
00:11:57,372 --> 00:12:01,201
Whatever, if you have anything to request, you have to ask me first, alright?

173
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,998
You must! Alright?

174
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:03,966
Yes.

175
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:09,226
Uh? What is this? Are you touched?

176
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,505
Thank you.

177
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:12,957
Really, there is only you.

178
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,705
Hey… this is nothing.

179
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:22,967
If you get to know me, I am a more touching person.

180
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,858
Eventually, you aren’t going to call, is that it?

181
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,702
That’s fine with me.

182
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:31,537
I am in no hurry at all.

183
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,883
It is slightly chilly, right?

184
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,533
Oh!

185
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:37,505
Hey!

186
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:41,781
What are you doing like a village ahjussi? Where did you get that dowdy hat?

187
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:43,287
I see that the two of you went somewhere together.

188
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,223
What’s it to you what others do?

189
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,285
Why? Are you curious?

190
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,017
Not at all.

191
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,855
I’m sorry I couldn’t call.

192
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,333
I was running around because of the watch.

193
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,917
Hey, that’s alright. You needn’t report everything to him.

194
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,985
Anyway, he isn’t even bothered.

195
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,186
Of course.

196
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:57,835
Why should I be bothered?

197
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:59,903
It isn’t even my business.

198
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:04,902
See! His consideration for others is less than the Achilles tendon of an ant.

199
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:10,698
Don’t be bothered about that kind of guy and let’s go in.

200
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:14,734
Wait!

201
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:17,205
Hey! Put those scissors away.

202
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,291
Why?

203
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,302
Not you...

204
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,007
But Stylist Jang.

205
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:25,107
So, why?

206
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:27,987
I have some business with Stylist Jang. What?

207
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:36,974
Do you have a problem?

208
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:44,087
Cut this. Prettily!

209
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:52,067
By any chance...Did you call me last night because of this?

210
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,947
Don’t you think this is too much?

211
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:57,374
Wow! How could the two of you be so different?

212
00:13:57,374 --> 00:14:00,822
Sir Kang Hwi even came with me to the shop because he was worried.

213
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:04,002
What is this, Mr. Lee Tae Ik?

214
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:06,897
Why is one ‘Sir” and the other ‘Mister’?

215
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:10,473
Why? Why don’t you ask that great Sir to find the watch for you?

216
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,829
That is… my job.

217
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:15,901
Ah! Is that so?

218
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:19,253
If you can’t find the watch, you will have to compensate for it…

219
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,817
Do you have the money?

220
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,002
You wouldn’t have any regardless of whether I ask you or not.

221
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:33,711
See, if you had left when I told you to, this wouldn’t have happened.

222
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:38,041
Hey, what is this? Do you know how much this is?

223
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,342
I won’t do it! I won’t!

224
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,025
I’m a stylist, not a gardener.

225
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,704
Why do you make me do things like this also?

226
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:45,415
Since you aren’t good at being a stylist, I have to make you do this kind of thing.

227
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:50,042
Who’s the one who created big trouble as soon as she started work?

228
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,338
If you say that you will leave immediately today,

229
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,636
I will take care of the watch problem somehow.

230
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:55,459
That’s alright!

231
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,006
I will never break the contract first and leave.

232
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:00,622
If you can't find the watch, you must leave.

233
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:02,112
That is also a violation of the contract.

234
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:05,072
I will find it. It will do if I find it, right?

235
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:12,733
I guarantee you that you’ll never find it. Never!

236
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,867
Hey! Where are you going?

237
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:25,162
To find the watch!

238
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:38,146
I asked all the staff to check everywhere, but I don’t think it is here.

239
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:38,065
Why?

240
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:40,254
Did you find the watch?

241
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,047
There is no way you could have found it.

242
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:43,951
I’m busy now, I’m going to hang up.

243
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,072
Stylist Jang! Hey! Stylist Jang!

244
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,782
Ah! Why?

245
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,512
Come here running when I say it nicely.

246
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:54,846
I’ll give you just one hour.

247
00:15:54,846 --> 00:16:03,374
Ah, seriously! This rude bastard!

248
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:05,616
Here!

249
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,899
Ah! But, why is she still not coming?

250
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:12,358
See if you are even one minute late!

251
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,301
Lee Tae Ik, let me use the sauna.

252
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,026
Hey! How did you get in here?

253
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:17,673
Huh? The door was open.

254
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:18,911
Let me use the sauna.

255
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,574
It wasn’t made for you to use.

256
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:27,287
I will pay for this month’s electricity bill. Don’t be so cheap.

257
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,448
Oh!

258
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:29,331
What is this?

259
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,921
Hey!

260
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:34,222
What is this? Why is this here?

261
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:37,406
No way… Did you pocket this?

262
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:38,408
No, I didn’t.

263
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:41,401
Hey! The evidence is right here. How can you say that it isn’t?

264
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,618
Wow! Lee Tae Ik, seriously! I didn’t think you were like that.

265
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:45,092
I told you that it isn’t.

266
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:46,339
How dare you think of me like this?

267
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,445
Give it to me!

268
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:51,153
I will put it back where it was.

269
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:56,098
But why didn’t you say anything to Man Ok earlier, when you had this?

270
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,147
That is… I…

271
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:03,459
By any chance, were you purposely trying to give Man Ok a hard time?

272
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,685
Hey! When did I?

273
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:08,581
Look at you! Look at you! Your face has become red!

274
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:11,304
You were trying to get rid of her using this as an excuse, right?

275
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,546
Hey!

276
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:14,347
How could you… think of something like that?

277
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,104
Am I you?

278
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:21,056
Then what is it? Tell me, huh? Tell me.

279
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:25,951
Stylist Jang is here. Please open the door.

280
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,665
You’re caught in the act. Man Ok!

281
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,986
Won Kang Hwi!

282
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:31,348
Don’t do it!

283
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,976
Ah, why?

284
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:36,043
Do you know how much our Man Ok suffered emotionally because of you?

285
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,405
Things like this need to be revealed completely.

286
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:42,064
What Lee Tae Ik, a Hallyu star, did against a powerless stylist needs to be told to the whole world.

287
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:45,489
Stop with the nonsense!

288
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:46,726
I’m warning you.

289
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:49,358
I don’t think you are in a position to warn Sir Me, now.

290
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,512
Why don’t you move aside?

291
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:55,014
Hey! Yes, yes… The watch... I was going to return it.

292
00:17:55,014 --> 00:17:56,236
But Stylist Jang…

293
00:17:56,236 --> 00:18:00,572
What about me?

294
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,172
Hey! How did you come in?

295
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:03,732
The door was open.

296
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,571
Hey! I told you the door was open.

297
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:07,465
Hi, Man Ok.

298
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:13,487
I would have come earlier if I had known Kang Hwi was here.

299
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:14,773
What is it that you have to say to me?

300
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:15,533
Huh?

301
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:19,278
You asked me to come running because you had something to say to me.

302
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,205
Tae Ik said that he will solve the watch problem for you.

303
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:23,518
What?

304
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:24,443
Really?

305
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:28,732
It’s the truth. So, you needn’t worry about it anymore.

306
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,186
Suddenly… What are you saying?

307
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,418
You aren’t playing a joke on me by any chance, right?

308
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,842
What joke?

309
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:42,562
Hey! Lee Tae Ik, the Hallyu star, thinks so much of his family, he wouldn’t play a joke like that.

310
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:44,847
Isn’t that true?

311
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,348
That’s right.

312
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:50,207
I don’t play silly jokes like somebody.

313
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:51,453
Here.

314
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,641
Ta da!

315
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:57,411
Oh!

316
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:58,967
How did you find this?

317
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,507
See, what happened was Tae I…

318
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:04,361
Hey.Aren’t you taking a sauna?

319
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,094
C... can I?

320
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:11,416
Continuously from now on?

321
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:26,215
Yes.

322
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:30,646
Ga Ryeong. Till when do we have to be like this?

323
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:31,753
Wait a bit.

324
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,388
Didn’t you hear what the part-time employee said earlier?

325
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:36,877
That swindler is a regular here.

326
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:40,873
A culprit definitely returns to the (crime) scene.

327
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:42,159
No. No. <i>(in French)

328
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,543
Nora thinks differently.

329
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:45,635
The swindler is not an idiot.

330
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:49,241
Since we could be waiting here, would he come back here?

331
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,004
- Is that so? - Yes <I>(in French)

332
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:54,615
Just waiting here is...

333
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:59,384
Stupid! It’s a stupid thing to do.

334
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:04,457
We don’t know his name or his phone number. How do we find him?

335
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:06,619
I shouldn’t have heard about the press card.

336
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,106
Where on earth did they get the press cards from? They went in so easily.

337
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:12,087
Press card! Ga Ryeong, I thought of something!

338
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,773
What?

339
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:17,309
It is a really important thing.

340
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,337
If that man comes, please give him this memo.

341
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:24,255
Excuse me, this is a little…

342
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,931
What? You need to drive.

343
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:32,629
Non! This is a bribe…no, a present.

344
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:37,777
Nora, you seem not to know, but these things…

345
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:40,046
I just have to convey this to him, right?

346
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:43,719
We have to catch that rat-like creature.

347
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:47,534
This rat-like creature!

348
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:50,292
- So Ji Seung! This rat-like creature! - Hyung!

349
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,576
That rat!

350
00:20:51,576 --> 00:21:02,393
Where are you going! Catch him!

351
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,041
Where did he go?

352
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:12,041
Welcome!

353
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,235
Aigo! Shocks!

354
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:22,997
I’m paying for this. My throat is a little dry…

355
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:27,553
<i>Thank you for last time. We went in safely because of you.

356
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,742
<i>Can I get 3 more this time?

357
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,604
<i>My friends made a request…

358
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:36,652
<i>Please be sure to call me!

359
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:39,805
I guess they luckily didn’t get caught.

360
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:46,729
Didn’t they check?

361
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:50,326
Ah! I can’t hand these out randomly…

362
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:53,013
What are the names of your friends?

363
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:56,425
A million won per person, total 3 million. You know, right?

364
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:58,022
Swindler! Bastard!

365
00:21:58,022 --> 00:22:01,762
Hey! What are you doing?

366
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:03,946
How dare you steal money from a fan-for-life?!

367
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:06,734
Return our money while we're still asking nicely.

368
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,229
Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey! It hurts! It hurts! Wait a moment!

369
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,061
I...

370
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,342
Man Ok Kwan, affiliated to the Korean Hapkido Association and which boasts a 50 year tradition...

371
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:13,894
I am the best friend of Jang Man Ok, the Master of Man Ok Kwan.

372
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:16,751
How dare you con us? How?

373
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,873
I'll give it... I will give it to you, so first release this hand…

374
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,526
Oh! And you, put down the camera!

375
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:25,368
Ga Ryeong, don’t release him. What if he deceives us again?

376
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:27,944
I won't. I won’t. This time, it’s the truth.

377
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,916
Ah, really, it hurts… listen to me.

378
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,382
Hey! If it is the 3 of us, we can even set up a company.

379
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,058
Then you will get press cards and everything…

380
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:40,578
And you can go to all the showcases or whatever that you like.

381
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:41,766
Really?

382
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:42,879
Vrai?

383
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:45,266
Yes, really.

384
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,708
Yes, Kang Hwi.

385
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:51,067
I took care of it well.

386
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,781
No, I’m at home…

387
00:22:53,781 --> 00:23:00,099
Yes, Kang Hwi, I’ll see you tomorrow.

388
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:03,372
Oh! Shocks!

389
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:07,981
See you tomorrow. Kang Hwi, you, too.

390
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,999
Why are you getting surprised? Are you guilty of something to me?

391
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,285
Hey! What crime?

392
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:18,891
My friend. Should we have an in-depth conversation in awhile?

393
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:21,709
I signed an agreement.

394
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,044
Agreement?

395
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,424
What agreement?

396
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:29,692
Not to tell anything about the residence.

397
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,426
Really?

398
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:34,555
Then you really can’t tell anybody.

399
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:38,731
They say that there are many people who had to pay a huge amount of compensation because they broke that agreement.

400
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:40,016
Yes.

401
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,007
I plan on not saying anything.

402
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:44,044
I will also never tell anybody.

403
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:50,585
So friend, just tell me slightly where it is. <br />Slightly..

404
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:55,198
Hey! Han Ga Ryeong!

405
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:59,027
- Oh! It's Grandfather! Volume up! Volume! <br />- Volume?

406
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:01,895
Yes, Grandfather.

407
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:05,084
Of course, we were obviously in training now.

408
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:08,473
Ay! Ay! Ay!

409
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,684
The kids are so diligent.

410
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:13,144
Yab! Yab! Ay! Ay!

411
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:23,782
Yes, Grandfather, don’t worry. Come back safely.

412
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:25,526
Bad girl!

413
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:36,055
I even shouted along. And, you still can’t even tell me that? <br />You completely have no loyalty.

414
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:38,883
Nora, speed up! We can never lose her today.

415
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:49,621
Yes, let's go <I> (in French)

416
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,641
Why are you stopping?

417
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:59,362
No, no! In Paris, you must yield first. We are next.

418
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:02,496
You don’t know the basics of tailing after someone.

419
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:05,033
Huh?

420
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:18,275
Ah! That pain!

421
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:48,653
Why is she going round and round? I’m getting car sick…

422
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:49,093
<i>Take One</i>, rehearsal starts.

423
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:51,301
It’s all the same.

424
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:56,946
From the beginning of the 2nd verse, Tae Ik come to the middle, Kang Hwi come to the center from the left.

425
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:00,287
Kang Hwi, come forward.

426
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:04,565
Kang Hwi, are you alright?

427
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:07,448
What’s the matter? Are you alright?

428
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:09,056
Yes. It’s nothing.

429
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,865
Today we are singing live on a live telecast, will you be alright?

430
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:12,476
Since earlier, you haven't been able to concentrate.

431
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:13,972
Are you alright? Hyung?

432
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,669
I think my lens disappeared.

433
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,336
I will go out briefly.

434
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:26,317
I’m sorry, just a moment.

435
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:46,564
Tell them we will do it by AR.

436
00:26:46,564 --> 00:27:04,968
Why am I like this?

437
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:14,272
If you are going to say hi, do it properly, or just act like you didn’t see me.

438
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:15,593
Hello.

439
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,125
Uh, yes.

440
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:23,004
You heard that I am doing the sports drink commercial which you had been doing, right?

441
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:25,177
What to do because I am sorry?

442
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:30,023
But that company was looking for a fresh image.

443
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:34,458
They are looking for a new face to represent the company.

444
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,652
Fresh?

445
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,022
I guess you don’t even look at the mirror?

446
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:41,151
Or you act like you don’t know even if you do.

447
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:43,876
Change your hair salon. Or change your stylist.

448
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:45,563
Aren’t you fed up of being called a fake Won Kang Hwi?

449
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:53,074
If it was me, I would feel completely bad.

450
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:55,348
Ah, right!

451
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:59,036
That commercial, I’m going to keep doing it.

452
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:03,982
It tasted so bad that I was going to quit. <br />But they said that they would raise my contract fee by two-folds.

453
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,779
If I had known that you were going to do it, <br />I would have told them that I’m not going to do it.

454
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,437
Sorry!

455
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,532
Don’t be disappointed.

456
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:12,307
If they need a new look, they’ll look for you again.

457
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,565
Because you are fresh.

458
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,661
Right?

459
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:20,664
Work hard!

460
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,738
Aish!

461
00:28:22,738 --> 00:30:48,309
Ah! Aish!

462
00:30:48,309 --> 00:31:02,534
Subtitles brought to you by the Maid of the House 2 team at viki.com

463
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:04,624
<i>Hey! Seriously? Are you happy?

464
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:06,077
<i>Do you not know that I can't use anything?

465
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:10,608
<i>Did you ever hear that you hurt your eye slightly when you were a kid?

466
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:14,446
<i>Dogs, cats, rabbits... I hate things like that the most.

467
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:16,174
<i>Omo! Oh my!

468
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,906
<i>Hey, Lee Tae Ik, how could you work with a person of such low standards?

469
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,159
<i>Stylist Jang!

470
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,213
<i>Tae Ik hyung's cell is turned off. And Stylist Jang won't pick up.

471
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:27,168
<i>Get me out.

472
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:29,318
<i>Say, "Please get me out."

473
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,325
<i>Are you crazy!

474
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:33,084
<i>Tae Ik!

475
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,542
<i>Are you asking me to sleep outside?

476
00:31:35,542 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>If we sleep together and get into a scandal,<br /> will you take responsibility?</i>

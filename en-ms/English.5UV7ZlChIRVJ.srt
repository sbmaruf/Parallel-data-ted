00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:05,833
AdWords helps you reach your customers

2
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:06,835
whenever,

3
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:07,876
wherever,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,670
and however you want to reach them.

5
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,278
You can target your ads to broad groups of people.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
Or, people with specific characteristics and interests.

7
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,109
No matter what your goal,

8
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:20,752
you can get more out of AdWords if you take time

9
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:24,139
to define exactly who you want your ads to reach.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,950
To get started,

11
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:29,616
try asking the four "w's" of defining your audience.

12
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,312
"Who?"

13
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:30,982
"When?"

14
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:31,751
"Where?"

15
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:32,941
and "What?"

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,030
You'll use the answers to these questions

17
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,831
to set up and manage your campaign.

18
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:39,545
"Who?"

19
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,927
You know your customers better than anyone.

20
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:42,926
Who are they?

21
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:45,944
And, what sorts of things do they have in common with each other?

22
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,815
AdWords helps you reach people

23
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:50,673
based on where they are and what language they speak.

24
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:54,178
And, for some campaigns, AdWords connects you with people

25
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,168
based on age,

26
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,118
gender,

27
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:57,883
and interests.

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,840
"When?"

29
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:01,916
They say that timing is everything.

30
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:04,078
When is the best time to reach your customers?

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,250
On the weekend?

32
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:06,112
In the summer?

33
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:08,883
AdWords provides ad scheduling tools

34
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,291
that let you choose when your ads will likely appear.

35
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,501
Certain hours of the day.

36
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:15,212
specific days of the week,

37
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:18,504
Or, certain holidays or seasons.

38
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:20,413
"Where?"

39
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:22,247
It's a big world out there.

40
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:24,211
And you want to be able to to reach your customers

41
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,505
wherever they are.

42
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,832
AdWords can connect you to people located in specific countries.

43
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,166
Or, right around the corner.

44
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,047
And, we mean that literally.

45
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:37,927
Your ads can appear on the mobile devices of shoppers right near your store.

46
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,545
"What?"

47
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,589
Now, put yourself in your customers' shoes.

48
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:44,715
What words and phrases are they using,

49
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:45,913
and not using,

50
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,082
to search online for the products and services you offer?

51
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:52,005
These words and phrases, known as "search terms,"

52
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:54,003
are the keywords and negative keywords

53
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,753
that you should include in your AdWords campaigns.

54
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,252
Using the right keywords

55
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,312
is one of the most important ways to reach the audience

56
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:02,442
you're looking for.

57
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:05,165
Getting specific about your audience

58
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,687
is a great way to set yourself up for success

59
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:11,492

1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,910
Sarah has $48.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,050
She wants to save 1/3 of
her money for a trip.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,990
How many dollars should
she set aside?

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,530
So we essentially want to think
about what 1/3 of 48 is.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,170
Use 48 as the denominator
and find an

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,480
equivalent fraction to 1/3.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,070
So what they want us to do in
this problem is they want us

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,500
to say, OK, we want 1/3 of her
money, but we want to write

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,530
this as an equivalent fraction
where we have 48 in the

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,100
denominator.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,590
So this is equal to something,
some blank up here.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,425
This is equal to something
over 48.

13
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:44,120
So how can we get it to that
something over 48?

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,160
So let's think about what
this means for a second.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,430
So 1/3, if we were to draw
1/3, it looks like this.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,980
You could imagine a box
or a pie, I guess.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,690
So let's say that this is my
pie, and I have it split into

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,840
three pieces.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,860
So let me split it into
three even pieces.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,020
And 1/3 is one of those
three pieces.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,550
That is what 1/3 means.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,140
Now, if we want express this as
a fraction over 48, how can

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,740
we do that?

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,220
Well, we're going to
have to split this

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,280
thing into 48 pieces.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,350
How can we split something
into 48?

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,540
Well, 3 times 16 is 48, so if we
split each of these into 16

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,810
pieces-- and it's going
to be hard to draw

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,300
here, but you can imagine.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,130
Let's see, you split it into
two, now we've split it into

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,620
four, now you split
it into eight.

32
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,280
You're just going to end up with
a bunch of lines here,

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,360
but you can imagine, you can
just split each of these.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,120
If you split each of these into
enough, you would have 16

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,140
pieces, so those would
be 16 right there.

36
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,050
You would have 16 right there
and you have 16 right there.

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,740
And I can just keep doing it.

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,280
Let me do it in the
green over here.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,780
So if we just kept splitting
it up, we would get 48,

40
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,050
because you have this first
third would be 16 pieces, the

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,700
second third would be 16,
and then this third

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,820
third would be 16 pieces.

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,470
Altogether, you would
have 48 pieces.

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,110
Now, that 1/3, what does
that represent?

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,230
Well, that represents
16 of the 48.

46
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,450
It represents these
16 right here.

47
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,370
It represents these 16 right
there, so 1 over 3 is the

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,090
exact same thing.

49
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:41,120
So 1 over 3 is the exact same
thing as 16 over 48.

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,420
Now, we did it just by thinking
about it kind of

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,890
intuitively what 1/3 of 48 is,
but one way to do it more-- I

52
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,600
guess a process for doing it--
we would say, well, look, to

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,840
get the denominator, the bottom
number, from 3 to 48,

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,020
we multiply by 16.

55
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,790
3 times 16 is 48.

56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,760
And that's literally the process
of going from 3 pieces

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
to 48 pieces.

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,460
We have to multiply by 16.

59
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,500
We have to turn each of our
pieces into 16 pieces.

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,990
That's what we did.

61
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,030
Now, you can't just multiply
only the denominator by 16.

62
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,650
You have to multiply the
numerator by the same number.

63
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,750
And so if each of my pieces
now become 16 pieces, then

64
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,730
that one piece will
now become 16.

65
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,370
So one way to think about it,
you just say, well, 3 times 16

66
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,920
is 48, so 1 times 16 will be my
numerator, so it'll be 16.

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,180
So 1/3 is equal to 16/48.

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,040
And another way you could think
about it, which you'll

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,930
learn in more detail later on,
is we want 1/3 of 48, right?

70
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,060
That's how much she wants to
save. 1/3 of 48 is equal to

71
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,950
1/3 times 48.

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,130
And when you multiply-- let me
write it like this-- 1/3 times

73
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,370
48, and you could rewrite
48 as a fraction 48/1.

74
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,510
It literally represents
48 wholes.

75
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,380
And when you multiply fractions,
you can just

76
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,470
multiply the numerators.

77
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,370
So this is equal to 48 over--
and then you just multiply the

78
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,300
denominators.

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,970
48/3, 1 times 48 is 48.

80
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,560
We'll see this in more
detail in the future.

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,480
Don't worry about it
if it confuses you.

82
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,350
In the denominator, 3 times 1 is
3, and 48 divided by 3, or

83
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,320
48/3, is equal to 16.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,960
So 1/3 of 48 is 16,
or 16/48 is 1/3.

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,310
Hopefully, that make
sense to you.

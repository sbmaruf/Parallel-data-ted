1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,308
Most cells in the human body just go about their

2
00:00:03,308 --> 00:00:06,320
business on a daily basis in a fairly respectable way.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,960
Let's say that I have some cell here.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,250
This could be maybe a skin cell or really any cell in

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,480
any tissue in the body.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,702
As that tissue is growing or it's replacing dead cells

7
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:20,142
the cells will experience mitosis

8
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:21,254
and replicate themselves

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,367
make perfect copies of each other.

10
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,680
And then those two maybe will experience mitosis

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,436
and then if they realize that, gee, you know

12
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,330
it's getting a little bit crowded.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,840
There are other cells in my neighborhood.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,880
They'll recognize that, and say, you know, I'm going to

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,190
stop growing a little bit.

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,560
That's called contact inhibition.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,290
And so they'll just start growing.

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,534
And then let's say

19
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:49,670
one of them experiences a little defect,

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,662
and he says, you know what, gee,

21
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:54,730
something's a little bit wrong with me.

22
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,270
I, the cell, recognize this in myself, and the cells will

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,250
actually kill themselves.

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,770
That's how good of cellular citizens they are.

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,060
They'll kind of make way for other healthy cells.

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,840
So this guy might even kill himself if he realizes that

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
there's something wrong with him.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,110
There's actually a cellular mechanism that does that

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,170
called apoptosis.

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,255
And I want to make this very clear.

31
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,540
This isn't some type of outside influence on the cell.

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,860
The cell itself recognizes that it's somehow damaged

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,550
and it just destroys itself, so apoptosis.

34
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,870
So that's the regular circumstance even when there

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,000
is a mutation.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,590
And just to give you an idea, even if mutations are

37
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,880
relatively infrequent.

38
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,780
And I don't know the exact frequencies at

39
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,940
which mutations occur.

40
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,780
I suspect it's of different frequencies in different types

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,640
of tissues.

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,000
There are on the order of 100 billion.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,830
Let me do it in a different color.

44
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,760
There are on the order of 100 billion

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,740
new cells in the human body per day.

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,280
So even if a mutation only occurs one in a million times,

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,860
you're still dealing with roughly 100,000 mutations, and

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,169
maybe most of the mutations, maybe they're just some little

49
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,980
random things that don't really do a lot.

50
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,990
But if the mutations are a little bit more severe, the

51
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,480
cell will recognize it and destroy itself.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,890
And I want to make a very clear point here.

53
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,618
I'm talking about the cells of the body or most of the body.

54
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:26,554
These could be cells in my eyes

55
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:30,710
or the cells in my brain or the cells on my leg.

56
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,100
These aren't my germ cells.

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,768
So these mutations, even if the cell survives

58
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,260
will not be passed on to my offspring.

59
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,390
That's an entirely different discussion when

60
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,100
we talk about meiosis.

61
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,260
These are all my body cells and they're replicating, and

62
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,500
we've gone over this with mitosis.

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,480
So any mutations here, they'll either do nothing, or the

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,590
cells might malfunction a little bit, or the cells might

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,020
hurt themselves or hurt me, but they're not going to

66
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,430
affect my offspring.

67
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,230
And I want to make that point very clear.

68
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,390
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal, 100 billion new cells a day?

69
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,780
That must mean like every cell in my body has created, well

70
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,830
that just gives you an idea of how many cells we have. We

71
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,170
actually have on the order of, and you know it's obviously

72
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,010
not an exact number, but actually in the human body,

73
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,940
there's on the order of 100 trillion cells.

74
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,610
And if you look at it that way, you say on average, one

75
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,600
thousandth of your cells replicate each day, but the

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,700
reality is some cells don't replicate that frequently at

77
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,704
all and some cells replicate much more frequently.

78
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:38,480
Just to take a little side note here, this gives you an

79
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,040
appreciation, I think, for the complexity of the human body.

80
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,940
I mean we think of our own world economy and world

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,470
society as so complex, it's made up of 6 billion humans.

82
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,460
We're made up of 100 trillion cells.

83
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,780
Let me rewrite 100 trillion in billions.

84
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:03,560
100 trillion can be rewritten as 100,000 billion cells.

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,440
And each one of those 100,000 billion cells are these huge--

86
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,010
I know I shouldn't use the word huge-- but they're these

87
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,890
complex ecosystems in and of

88
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,959
themselves with their nucleuses.

89
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,110
And we'll talk about all the different organelles they

90
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,120
have, and we talked about cellular replication, DNA

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,140
replication and how the cell replicates.

92
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,190
So these things aren't jokes and they have all of these

93
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,580
complex membranes that take things into them.

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,150
They are creatures to themselves, but they live in

95
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,550
this complex environment or society that is each of us.

96
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,020
So that's just a side note just to appreciate how large

97
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,790
and how complex we are.

98
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,030
But you can imagine, and this is how I got off on this

99
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,090
tangent, if we're making on the order of 100 billion new

100
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,140
cells every day, you're going to have a lot of mutations,

101
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,820
and maybe some of the mutations, you know I said

102
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,030
some of them don't do anything.

103
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,530
Some of them, the cell recognizes that the cell is

104
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,140
just going to be kind of dead weight so the cell kind of

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,240
eliminates itself.

106
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,370
But every now and then, you have mutations where the cell

107
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,220
doesn't eliminate itself and it also deforms the cell.

108
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,780
So when you have that, let's say I have some cell here.

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,280
I have some cell and it's got some mutation.

110
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,320
I'll do that mutation with a little x right here.

111
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,550
That's in its DNA.

112
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,180
Maybe it's got a couple of mutations.

113
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,510
So one of the mutations keeps it from experiencing

114
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,460
apoptosis, or destroying itself, and maybe one of the

115
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,090
mutations makes it replicate a little bit

116
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,610
faster than its neighbors.

117
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,340
So this cell, through mitosis, it makes a bunch of copies of

118
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,130
itself or a ton of copies of itself.

119
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,490
And this kind of body of cells that essentially has a defect,

120
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,060
they're all from one original cell that kept duplicating and

121
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,050
then those duplicating, but all these are defective cells.

122
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,910
If you were to look at them compared to the tissue around

123
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,870
it, it would look abnormal in some way.

124
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,850
Maybe it wouldn't function properly.

125
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,100
This is called a neoplasm.

126
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,910
Now, a lot of neoplasms, well they don't have to

127
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,910
form a body like this.

128
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,570
Sometimes they might somehow circulate in the body, but

129
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,200
most of the time they form this kind of big lump.

130
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,080
And if they get large enough, they're noticeable.

131
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,230
And that's when we call it a tumor.

132
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,990
So if this is actually a lump of kind of differentiated

133
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,290
tissue that's definitely abnormal, that's

134
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,730
what you call a tumor.

135
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,360
So the term neoplasm and tumor are often used

136
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,070
interchangeably.

137
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,900
Tumor is the word we use more in our everyday vocabulary.

138
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Now, if this lump just kind of grows to a certain size, it's

139
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,640
just there, it doesn't really do anything dangerous, it's

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,470
not replicating out of control.

141
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,380
I guess it's not replicating a lot faster than its

142
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,690
neighboring cells and it's just hanging out, maybe

143
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,340
growing a little bit, but not in any significant way harming

144
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,340
our environment, we call that a benign

145
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
tumor or a benign neoplasm.

146
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,530
And benign essentially means harmless.

147
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,155
Benign tumor.

148
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,810
That means that's good.

149
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,610
You want to hear that.

150
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,380
If you got a lump-- God forbid you have a lump either way--

151
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,990
but if you do and it's a benign tumor, that means that

152
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,690
lump, it can kind of stick around, no damage done.

153
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,400
But if these DNA mutations, and maybe some of these are,

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
it is benign, but maybe one of the benign ones has another

155
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,255
mutation in it that starts making it grow like crazy.

156
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,320
And not only does it grow like crazy,

157
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,776
but it becomes invasive.

158
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:55,330
And invasive means that it doesn't care what's

159
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,630
going on around it.

160
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,480
It just wants to infiltrate everything.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,080
So let's say that guy grows like crazy.

162
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,430
Let me do it in a different color.

163
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,700
And he starts infiltrating other

164
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,280
tissue, so he's invasive.

165
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,810
So super growth, he's invasive.

166
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,560
So he doesn't care what's going on.

167
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,430
He's all of a sudden turned into some type of a cellular

168
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,420
psychopath.

169
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,550
And even worse, his descendants, it's not just one

170
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:23,980
cell anymore.

171
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,520
He just keeps duplicating and passing on this kind of broken

172
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,760
genetic information that makes it want to replicate.

173
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,610
And then maybe there could be more and more things that

174
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,520
break down in its I guess offspring or the DNA that

175
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,130
comes from its replications.

176
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,390
And actually, that's a good likelihood, because the same

177
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,730
parts of its DNA that broke down, some of the DNA that

178
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,060
broke down in this guy, some of the mutations might have

179
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,040
actually hurt the DNA replication scheme, so that

180
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,240
mutations become more frequent.

181
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,660
So more frequent mutations.

182
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,340
So as these replicate, more and more mutations appear, and

183
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,710
then maybe eventually one of the mutations appears that

184
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,010
allows these cells to break off and then travel to other

185
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,260
parts of the body.

186
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,320
And then those parts of the body start to take over and

187
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,190
start taking over all of the cells.

188
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,500
And this process is called the cell has-- this is one of the

189
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,770
hardest words for me to say, something wrong with my

190
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,970
brain-- but the cell has metastasized.

191
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,710
You might have heard the word metastasis, and that's just

192
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,470
the notion of these run amok cells all of a sudden being

193
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,810
able to travel to different parts of the body.

194
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,790
And I think you guys know what we call these cells.

195
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,890
These cells that aren't respecting their cellular

196
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,310
neighborhood.

197
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,960
They're growing like crazy.

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,690
They don't experience that contact inhibition.

199
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,940
They're invasive.

200
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,580
They start crowding out other cells and

201
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,040
hogging up the resources.

202
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,290
And they keep mutating really fast because they have all of

203
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,050
these genetic abnormalities.

204
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,150
And eventually they might even break away and start

205
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,940
infiltrating other parts of the body.

206
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,985
These are cancers or cancer cells.

207
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,100
And so you might have an appreciation for

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
why this is so hard.

209
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,240
Cancer is such a hard disease to quote, unquote, cure.

210
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,610
Because it really isn't just one disease.

211
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,690
It's not like one type of bacteria or one type of virus

212
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,440
that you can pinpoint and say let's attack this.

213
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,800
Cancer is a whole class of mutations where the cells

214
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,250
start exhibiting this fast invasive growth and this

215
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,620
metastasis.

216
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,520
So you might look at one type of cancer and be able to say,

217
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,700
hey, let's target the mutation where the cells look like this

218
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,020
and you're able to knock out some of them.

219
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,720
Let me do this in this color.

220
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,300
So maybe you're able to knock out that guy,

221
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,160
that guy, that guy.

222
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,030
But because their DNA replication system might be

223
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,160
broken in some way, they continue to mutate, so

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,790
eventually you have one version that's able to not be

225
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,590
knocked out by whatever method you get.

226
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,200
And so you have this kind of new form of cancer, and then

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,180
that new form of cancer is even harder to kill.

228
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,210
So you can imagine that cancer is kind of a

229
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,490
never ending fight.

230
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,820
And you kind of have to attack the general idea behind it.

231
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,770
Chemotherapy and radiation, all of these type of things.

232
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,390
They try to attack things that are fast growing because

233
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,920
that's the kind of one common theme

234
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,030
behind all of the cancers.

235
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,810
And we could do a whole playlist on what cancer is and

236
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,400
how people are attacking it, but I wanted to at least show

237
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,860
you in this video that cancer really is just a byproduct of

238
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,510
broken mitosis, or even more specifically, broken DNA

239
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,540
replication.

240
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,100
That we have all of these cells replicating themselves

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,450
every day on the order of 100 billion, and every now and

242
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,960
then something breaks.

243
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,650
Usually when they break, either nothing happens or the

244
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,010
cell kills itself.

245
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,960
But every now and then, the cells start replicating even

246
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,450
though they're broken.

247
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,480
And sometimes they start replicating like crazy.

248
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,070
If they just replicate, but they're really not doing any

249
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,720
harm, it's benign.

250
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,730
But if they start replicating like crazy, taking over

251
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,950
resources and spreading through the body, you're

252
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,410
dealing with a cancer.

253
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,980
So hopefully, you found that interesting.

254
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,380
You already know a good bit of the science that kind of deals

255
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,680
with what is probably one of the worst ailments that we

256
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,470
deal with as creatures.

257
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,150
I mean, obviously, we're not the only people who can

258
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,990
experience cancers.

259
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,340
Even plants have cancers.

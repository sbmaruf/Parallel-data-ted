1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,480
Simplify 48/64 to
lowest terms.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,440
Let's see if we can
visualize this.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,180
So we have 64.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,200
I guess 64 would be a whole,
so let's draw a whole here.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,400
So let's say that's a whole.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,020
Maybe we're talking
about a candy bar.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,910
Let me draw the whole.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,230
We're talking about
a whole candy bar.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,790
That would be 64 fourths.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,230
It would be the whole candy
bar right there.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,360
And 48 of the 64, you could
imagine splitting this up into

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,930
64 super-small pieces.

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,180
You wouldn't be able to see what
I drew here, but if we

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,090
had 48 of them, it would get us
about that much of them, so

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,960
that would be the 48
out of the 64.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,370
So this whole blue area is 64.

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,550
The 48 is this purple area
right over here.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,360
So let me write it over here.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,700
48/64, and we want to write it
in lowest terms, and we'll

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,110
talk more about what lowest
terms even means.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,820
Now, is there a way to group
these 48 or these 64 into

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,890
groups of numbers that
will maybe simplify

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,890
them a little bit?

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,740
And to think about that, you'd
have to think about what is

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,100
the largest factor that is
common to both 48 and 64?

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,550
Or you can think of it
as what is their

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,230
greatest common divisor?

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,640
Well, the largest number that I
can think of that goes into

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,650
48-- you could do it either by
just thinking about it or you

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,200
could actually write out
all of its factors.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,310
But if you were to write all the
factors for 48 and all the

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,630
factors for 64, the one that
pops out at me as the largest

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,930
that goes into both is 16.

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,860
So you could say that 48 is
equal to-- well, what is it?

35
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:53,770
It's 3 times 16, and
64 is 4 times 16.

36
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,080
Now this is interesting.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,135
So this 48 that we drew in
magenta right here, we could

38
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,500
view this as three
groups of 16.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,190
So that's one, two--
let me make them a

40
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,210
little bit more even.

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,730
So one, two, three groups of 16,
so that's 16, that's 16,

42
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,140
and that is 16.

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,170
That would be 48.

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,830
I could draw 16 bars here so
that we have 16 pieces, but

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,040
that's a group of 16, a group
of 16 and a group of 16.

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,790
That's what 48 is.

47
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,960
Now, 64 is four groups of 16.

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,050
So we could make, if you look at
the 64, that is a 16, that

49
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,750
is a 16, that is a 16, and
then that is another 16.

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,585
These should all be
the same length.

51
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,300
I drew it a little bit off.

52
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,750
So what is 48/64 in
lowest terms?

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,590
We want to write this in as
simple as possible fraction.

54
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,390
Well, if we make each of the
pieces equal to 16 of our old

55
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,450
pieces, if we make this into one
piece, if we turn 16 into

56
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,790
one, then we are talking about
instead of 48/64, we're

57
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,310
talking about three.

58
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,920
So this is one piece, two
pieces, three pieces of a

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,320
total of four.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,840
So this is going to
be equal to 3/4.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,820
And hopefully, you see kind
of a mathematical way of

62
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,890
immediately thinking about it.

63
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,710
If you can factor this out and
you can actually factor out

64
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,510
its greatest common factor, so
48 is 3 times 16, 64 is 4

65
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,930
times 16, and then these
cancel each other out.

66
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:42,430
view This is equivalent
to 3/4 times 16/16.

67
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,810
This is the same
thing as that.

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,290
And 16/16 is 1, and you're
just left with 3/4.

69
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,520
Now, if you didn't immediately
recognize that 16 goes into

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,300
both 48 and 64, you could
do it step by step.

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,440
So let's say we started
off with 48/64.

72
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,680
Now, the key thing to remember
with any fraction, whatever

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,780
you do to the numerator, you
have to do to the denominator.

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:17,589
So let's say we divide the
numerator by 2, we also have

75
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,470
to divide the denominator
by 2, so we could get 2.

76
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,010
We know that these are
both divisible by 2.

77
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,800
They're both even.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,160
So that would get us to 24/32.

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,780
And we'll say, well, look, these
two numbers, those are

80
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,020
both divisible by 2.

81
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,240
Well, see if we can think
of a larger number.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,830
Well, actually, they're both
divisible by 4, so maybe you

83
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,180
don't realize that they're
also both divisible by 8.

84
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,770
So let's say you
did it with 4.

85
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,800
So now we divide the top by 4.

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,580
So we're going to divide by 4.

87
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,680
We get 6.

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,880
You have to do the same to the
bottom, to the denominator.

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,520
Divide by 4, you get 8.

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,880
So 48/64 is the same thing
as 24/32, which is the

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,560
same thing as 6/8.

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,140
And these are both divisible
by 2, so if you divide the

93
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,170
numerator by 2, you get 3.

94
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,860
You divide that the denominator
by 2, you get 4.

95
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,030
And so this is the simplest
possible terms, because 3 and

96
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,400
4 share no common factors
greater than 1, so we're in

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,920
lowest possible terms.

98
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,800
So however you want to do it.

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,520
The easiest way or the fastest
way is to say, hey, 16 is the

100
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,290
biggest number that goes
into both of these.

101
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,120
Divide both by 16.

102
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,400
You get 3/4.

103
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,660
And really when you're dividing
the numerator and

104
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,770
denominator by 16, you're
turning groups of 16 into one

105
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,460
piece or 16 super-small pieces
of the pie into one bigger

106
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,480
piece of the pie.

107
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,310
So this goes from 64
pieces to 4 pieces.

108
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,630
This goes from 48 pieces
to 3 pieces.

1
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:15,263
Excuse me, do you have some time?

2
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,479
Ah...Oh...I am Korean [&lt;i&gt;in Japanese.]

3
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:23,381
I am Korean. [&lt;i&gt; in English.]

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,950
I know. I know. &lt;br&gt; You are Korean. [&lt;i&gt; In Korean.]

5
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:30,243
It's me, Man Ok!

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,548
Oh, Kang Hwi. What a surprise!

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,280
How do I look? No one will be able to tell, right?

8
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:37,857
Yes, if you said you were a duck, they would believe you.

9
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:40,797
--What? &lt;br&gt; --I'm just joking! Just joking!

10
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:42,838
Lets go, Man Ok.

11
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:44,197
Huh? Where are you going?

12
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,871
I'm hungry! I will buy you something really good to eat. &lt;br&gt; Let's go eat delicious food.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,150
You waited a long time.

14
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,146
Here.

15
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,111
Try it. The udon here is really the best.

16
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:05,253
Ah! And...

17
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:08,615
This is a secret.

18
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:14,331
I will only give this to really special people.

19
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:16,657
I like shrimp. &lt;br&gt;I will enjoy it.

20
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:18,203
Yes.

21
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,453
How is it? &lt;br&gt; Yummy?

22
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,571
It is similar to the taste of udon sold at rest areas.

23
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:40,172
What did you say?

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,330
Man Ok, don't eat it.

25
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:41,921
I will eat it all.

26
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:43,383
Just joking!

27
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:47,501
It's actually really delicious! &lt;br&gt;The noodles are so chewy!

28
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,414
This is really awesome!

29
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,172
Is it, isn't it?

30
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,087
Is it delicious?

31
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,962
Kang Hwi-nim, you should hurry and eat, too.

32
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:56,122
Yeah.

33
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,599
I will enjoy it.

34
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,106
But, Kang Hwi-Nim

35
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:09,071
You didn't find the voice recording, did you?

36
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,575
Ah! That is...

37
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:16,301
If you had found the voice recording, there is no way you would have come here with the President.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,660
Hurry and eat up. &lt;br&gt;It's not good if it gets bloated.

39
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:33,572
Let's hurry up and eat, then go shopping later. &lt;br&gt;It feels like a million years since I went shopping.

40
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:36,626
--Hurry and eat. &lt;br&gt; -- Yes.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,040
Woah! Wow! &lt;br&gt; It's awesome.

42
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,659
This...

43
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,664
Are you going to buy a hairpin?

44
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,617
Yes.

45
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:58,152
Which one among the two do you think is prettier?

46
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,088
Well...let's see...

47
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:06,831
They're both pretty! &lt;br&gt; I'll buy them both for you.

48
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:10,697
No, I'll only get one.

49
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,506
I'll just get this one.

50
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,791
Why? I said I'll buy them both. &lt;br&gt;Buy them both.

51
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:17,742
My grandfather... &lt;br&gt; A long time ago, he used to say

52
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:19,966
wanting to have this and that is greedy.

53
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:25,084
If a person is greedy, &lt;br&gt; eventually he ends up losing everything he owns.

54
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:28,301
Let's go pay.

55
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:36,964
This is also pretty.

56
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,872
Man Ok!

57
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,700
Let's go here!

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,390
What?

59
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:58,194
&lt;i&gt; Episode 10, Part 2&lt;/i&gt;

60
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,932
Excuse me, Kang Hwi-Nim.

61
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,897
How did it happen?

62
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,771
Why are you with the President...?

63
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:15,306
Wow! This place is more spacious than I thought.

64
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:19,254
Aren't you going to tell?

65
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:27,675
I'm not asking either.

66
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:31,876
Why Man Ok came to Japan.

67
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:37,283
So, Man Ok, just don't ask either.

68
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:41,225
Today, the things that we couldn't do so far because I was locked up in the basement,

69
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:45,302
let's do them all and have fun, huh?

70
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,448
Man Ok, let's go here!

71
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,248
They said this place is really fascinating.

72
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,091
Let's go.

73
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,372
Quickly.

74
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:57,188
Let's go. Let's hurry and go!

75
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,150
Ya-ho. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ya-ho.

76
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,019
Ya-ho. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ya-ho.

77
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:19,948
Wah! Wah! This is really fascinating. &lt;br&gt; Man Ok, hurry and try it, too!

78
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,089
Ya-hoo. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ya-hoo. &lt;/i&gt;

79
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,334
Omo!

80
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:28,033
What I said is true, isn't it? &lt;br&gt; The sound really echoes!

81
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,149
It really does!

82
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:36,240
Ya-hoo! Kang Hwi-nim! &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Ya-hoo!

83
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,155
It's really awesome. &lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi-nim! &lt;br&gt; It's like an echo!

84
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:42,303
Me, me! Let me try one more time.

85
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:46,545
Jang Man Ok! &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Jang Man Ok!

86
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:49,503
More than the actress, Jang Man Ok &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; More than the actress, Jang Man Ok

87
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,773
is much more... &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; is much more...

88
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:56,456
pretty! &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; pretty!

89
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,454
Man Ok,

90
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:07,255
I have something to tell you.

91
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:13,815
Thank you for being by my side when &lt;br&gt; I was having a hard time.

92
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:17,845
In the future, like now,

93
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:21,547
can you be by my side?

94
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,760
&lt;i&gt;Subtitles by The Maid of Full House 2 @ Viki

95
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:40,336
Just a moment.

96
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,479
&lt;i&gt; Where are you?

97
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,050
&lt;i&gt; Didn’t you hear that you have a meeting with the reporters tonight? &lt;/i&gt;

98
00:06:59,046 --> 00:06:59,936
I will be there.

99
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:02,378
&lt;i&gt; There isn’t much time. Where are you? &lt;/i&gt;

100
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,627
&lt;i&gt; I will send Go Dong, so tell me your location. &lt;/i&gt;

101
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,489
I'll be there on time.

102
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,787
That's why I'm asking where you are!

103
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,965
You said you will earn your keep.

104
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:28,464
I’m asking because you talked big saying that you will serve.

105
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,253
Come quickly and work!

106
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,468
What are you looking at so intently?

107
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:41,343
Do you want a drink?

108
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:49,006
If you have gotten some fresh air, let’s go back.

109
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:50,857
Go back,

110
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:52,902
and start afresh with me from the beginning.

111
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:55,582
I will help you.

112
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,536
You will help me?

113
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:02,775
Senior Manager Hwang, you will help me?

114
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,936
In your eyes, I may not appear trustworthy.

115
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,299
But, fellow... at least I am different from LJ.

116
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,168
What is different?

117
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,369
You or President LJ...

118
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,003
are all businessmen, aren’t you?

119
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,834
People who sell people…

120
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,472
No.

121
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:22,545
I never once thought of you guys like that.

122
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,450
At least I know what you truly want.

123
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:29,083
What I truly want?

124
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,420
What is that?

125
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,253
You...

126
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:34,533
said you weren't a singer because &lt;br&gt;you wanted to be one.

127
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:34,936
It was because of money,

128
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:35,579
because of the house,

129
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:36,956
because of L. J..

130
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:40,245
You said that you were dragged all the way here.

131
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:42,174
But that's not it.

132
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,970
You.

133
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,017
Tell me...

134
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,659
You want to stand on stage again, don’t you?

135
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,874
Stand!

136
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,235
Stand on the stage and get it all back...

137
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,091
Your fame, Full House...

138
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,057
and the person you love.

139
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,847
Return,

140
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,345
and get them all back.

141
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:03,126
On your own!

142
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,025
That is what you need to do now!

143
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:14,378
Look, look here.

144
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,462
Your fans are asking you to come back.

145
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:19,375
I don't need it!

146
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:24,927
Just leave me alone.

147
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:27,484
Tae Ik!

148
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,103
Tae Ik!

149
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:39,682
Tae Ik oppa, please come back! We love you!

150
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:55,683
&lt;i&gt;Man Ok! I really must tell you something! &lt;br&gt; See you in Seoul!

151
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,260
Tae Ik. Tae Ik. I love you. &lt;br&gt; Tae Ik, Tae Ik. I love you !

152
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,334
Do you want a drink?

153
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,939
Is that a trend these days?

154
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,020
That’s all right.

155
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,363
I already had a drink, so you drink.

156
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,995
Then, since you already had a drink, have another.

157
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,365
What is this? &lt;br&gt;Where is it that you can just come in?

158
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,386
I’m leaving tomorrow.

159
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:50,434
It’s my last night in Japan. &lt;br&gt;You can’t even do this for me?

160
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,074
You said that you won’t go if I don’t go.

161
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,908
That’s what I planned on doing.

162
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:57,162
But the ticket is only for tomorrow.

163
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,496
I bought that cheap by fixing the date, &lt;br&gt;so they said that I can’t even change it.

164
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:01,985
Ha!

165
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,501
Aigo!

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,380
So, let’s go together, huh?

167
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,769
If you came to drink beer, just have beer and go.

168
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,375
Ah, seriously!

169
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:28,374
Ah, seriously!

170
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,103
Can’t you just go back with me?

171
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,531
Look here!

172
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,554
Mr. Rude Bastard!

173
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:40,837
You know, I, to come all the way here,

174
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:45,018
spent all the money I have completely.

175
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,091
You!

176
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:55,253
Do you even know how expensive &lt;br /&gt;the exchange rate is these days?

177
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,736
What? You?

178
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,209
Rude bastard?

179
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:04,636
There is some more.

180
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,670
Stop drinking.

181
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,147
What is this?

182
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:26,858
That stormy change of temperament?

183
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:29,665
This rude...

184
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,547
This rude bastard, what is so nice about him?

185
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,539
Still, you...

186
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:41,768
are very blessed.

187
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:46,577
Having people who love only you,

188
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,249
and having people who look only at you…

189
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,667
It is such a happy thing.

190
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:01,034
So! Don’t run away!

191
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,329
What fault do your fans have?

192
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,677
Their only fault is loving you!

193
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,250
You have multiple personalities!

194
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,660
What, on earth, is so nice about a guy like this?

195
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:23,783
You are indeed good-looking.

196
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:34,356
Jang Man!

197
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,571
Jang Man!

198
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,977
Tell them to bring more alcohol.

199
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:42,113
Alcohol...

I packed all your luggage, hyung-nim.

225
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,951
Yes. All right. Let’s go.

226
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:45,109
We were really indebted to you all this time.

227
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:47,178
Indebted? No.

228
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,600
I was more thankful during your stay here&lt;br /&gt; because you helped me out.

229
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:57,912
You made a lot of delicious things also. Thank you.

230
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,425
Miss, are you going home now?

231
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,091
I want to go, too. Huh?

232
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,649
I want to go home, too.

233
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,818
Mina, why are you acting like this again?

234
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,628
- Take me home also. &lt;br&gt; - Mina!

235
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:14,314
Lee Tae Ik will come to take you soon.

236
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,566
You must be healthy till then.

237
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,949
But, where has he gone off to since this morning?

238
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,701
He isn’t even coming out to see the guests off.

239
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,740
It’s all right.

240
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,074
Let's go, Stylist Jang. &lt;br&gt;We'll be late.

241
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,214
Yes.

242
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:35,755
Goodbye!

243
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,487
Goodbye!

244
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,045
Goodbye!

245
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:00,893
- Let’s go. &lt;br&gt; - Yes.

246
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:09,793
Bum Soo hyung!

247
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:16,226
Tae Ik!

248
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,381
Lee Tae Ik!

249
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,204
Jang Man, you be in charge of this.

250
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,448
Hey, this fellow!

251
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,246
You have an aptitude for shocking people! Let’s go.

252
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:41,877
I will check in the baggage. &lt;br&gt; Go have some coffee.

253
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:42,858
Yes.

254
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:47,914
What are you going to drink?

255
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,154
Don't smile.

256
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:53,733
I'll develop affections for you.

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,190
What are you going to drink?

258
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:01,554
I want to drink water.

259
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:04,584
7 parts cold water and 3 parts hot water. &lt;br&gt;Make sure the ratio is exact.

260
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,365
Yes, Tae Ik-nim.

261
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:19,652
We must hurry.

262
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:22,755
The President and Se Ryeong are already waiting at the lounge.

263
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:48,124
Hyung-nim, hurry and come.

264
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,460
When we arrive, you will be crazy busy.

265
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,160
First of all, your damaged image, the company will…

266
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,924
President, take care of it as you wish.

267
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,296
Yes, all right.

268
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,746
And... the problem about Stylist Jang…

269
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,578
She has a history of being exposed &lt;br /&gt;to the media because of Tae Ik.

270
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:44,597
I wonder if we would be creating &lt;br&gt;a problem by insisting on using her.

271
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:48,524
If you are thinking of reneging on the promise&lt;br /&gt;you made with me, tell me now.

272
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:51,003
I will disappear again as soon as we land.

273
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,747
Oh! Oh! Run! Run!

274
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,451
Oppa!

275
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,350
Reporter Han! Reporter Song! Come to your senses! &lt;br&gt;We came here to cover news.

276
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,754
Covering news is not important now.

277
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:29,026
Our Kang Hwi oppa has made a reappearance after such a long time!

278
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,870
Oppa!

279
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:32,528
Ga Ryeong! Don't cry!

280
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:33,916
- Hey! &lt;br&gt;- Kang Hwi oppa!

281
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:36,442
Come to your senses!

282
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:38,718
You should never forget the spirit of journalism anywhere.

283
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,245
What is Kang Hwi? Seriously!

284
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,997
The best in the universe, Won Kang Hwi!

285
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:52,682
We love you, Won Kang Hwi!

286
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:56,556
The best in the universe, Won Kang Hwi!

287
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:20,257
Why aren't they coming out?

288
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,037
Senior Manager Hwang, did you sell roast chestnuts before?

289
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:31,586
This was fashionable back then!

290
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,744
It's called a military hat.

291
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:34,966
What military hat?

292
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,990
Lee Tae Ik, if you really don't like it, do you want to exchange it for my scarf?

293
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,190
With that wrapping cloth? Forget it!

294
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:43,587
Let's go out first, huh?

295
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,980
Here, here, here...

296
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:49,829
Please ask your questions one person at a time.

297
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:51,341
What is the reason for being ousted?

298
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:55,482
Is it because of your discord with Lee Tae Ik and the love triangle with Miss Jang?

299
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,602
No, it isn't.

300
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,555
There was a small misunderstanding with the company.

301
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,268
Now, it has been amicably solved.

302
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,701
How have you been since you were ousted?

303
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,638
You must have had a really hard time.

304
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:09,912
Personally, it was a hard time. &lt;br&gt;But, since my schedule was so busy, in the past,

305
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:13,305
I couldn't think about a lot of things.&lt;br&gt;This was an opportunity to reflect on them.

306
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:15,678
Being ousted from the team and being reinstated,

307
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,842
during this time, the problem of Lee Tae Ik's contract engagement surfaced as a problem.

308
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:21,813
Won Kang Hwi's come back and Lee Tae Ik's incident,

309
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,009
are they related?

310
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:25,705
That is...

311
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,895
They are separate issues.

312
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:31,069
Whatever happened so far, because of the shameful incidents,

313
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,000
I apologize once more for causing the fans to worry.

314
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:38,686
Lee Tae Ik has voluntarily withdrawn himself.

315
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:41,425
Then, will Won Kang Hwi go solo?

316
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:45,152
Whatever may happen, with an improved image,

317
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:48,593
I will try my best to stand like that in front of the fans.

318
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,838
Let's stop now. &lt;br&gt;Kang Hwi is tired.

319
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,819
Reporter Park, Reporter Kim, let's meet separately later. &lt;br&gt;Let's go!

320
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:57,539
- Please look here! &lt;br&gt;- This side please!

321
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:04,339
Hey! It's quieter than I had thought.

322
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:06,034
The reporters don't seem to be around.

323
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:08,951
I think it would have been okay for you not to wear that hat.

324
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,090
Will you go to the office?

325
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,445
Stop by the office and drop the kids off at Full House. The remodeling is over.

326
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,508
It must have been uncomfortable, move to the main building.

327
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:21,572
I'm fine.

328
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,953
I already got furniture in, so the room I was using is more comfortable.

329
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:27,446
Then Kang Hwi, the room you were using originally in the main building…

330
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:31,086
It’s all right. I will just stay at the annex.

331
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,247
Annex?

332
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,505
I will take care of it, so don’t worry too much.

333
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,770
The annex went into the President’s hands?

334
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:51,555
How did that happen?

335
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:55,193
It won’t suffice even retrieving back the main building, how can you lose it like that?

336
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,291
My words exactly.

337
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,993
If you are going to create trouble, consult me before making trouble.

338
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,801
If it goes into Lee Jun, that jerk’s hands,

339
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,660
he will never give it up just like that even if he dies.

340
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:07,446
What are you going to do now?

341
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,987
Then where will Lee Tae Ik live in the mean time?

342
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:12,689
What?!

343
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,002
Don’t worry about that.

344
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:18,394
You think I wouldn’t have even prepared that when I brought Tae Ik back?

345
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,312
Ah, seriously!

346
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:41,833
I couldn’t clean up because I was in Japan.

347
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,085
Come in. Come in and sit.

348
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:48,655
Excuse me, Senior Manager, where do we sit?

349
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:53,192
Ah! This way, this way.

350
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:58,662
Excuse me, Senior Manager,

351
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:02,218
it seems too small for the two of you to live here.

352
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:03,516
Why?

353
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,179
It’s just because it is a little untidy now.

354
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:07,788
For two men to live together, this place is just right.

355
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:10,681
I'll go to a hotel.

356
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,564
What? Hotel?

357
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:15,601
Hey! Whether it is a hotel or other lodging,

358
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:18,246
we don’t have money to use at the moment.

359
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:23,384
And it's tiring if reporters or Lee Jun find out where you are.

360
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,528
It is safest and best to be here right now.

361
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,474
Then Lee Tae Ik, would you like to come to my home?

362
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,755
Never mind!

363
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:33,622
I will take care of my business, so go home now.

364
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:34,363
Still...

365
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:36,525
Yes, yes.

366
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:40,516
It’s just a little messy. &lt;br&gt;It’s not like my house is uninhabitable.

367
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:47,007
Let’s clean up first.

368
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,898
Yes, yes.

369
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:52,404
Where was the vacuum cleaner?

370
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:56,643
Will you really be okay here?

371
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:58,444
I will be fine.

372
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,449
Now go.

373
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:17,544
Will Lee Tae Ik be all right here?

374
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:22,504
He will be. He said so himself.

375
00:26:27,322 --> 00:26:29,282
&lt;i&gt; President Lee &lt;/i&gt;

377
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,350
Senior Manager Hwang! &lt;br&gt;Bum Soo hyung!

378
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,110
What is that?

379
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,146
Why aren’t you sleeping and calling me?

380
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:38,544
Jang Man, this house is weird.

381
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:43,255
Huh? Why? You can’t sleep because it is uncomfortable?

382
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:45,666
I think there is somebody here.

383
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,399
Huh?

384
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:49,456
Are you talking about Senior Manager Hwang?

385
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:51,937
No, scatter, scatter…

386
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:55,878
It is full of crawling strange things&lt;br&gt; that make these noises.

387
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,397
Scatter?

388
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:01,878
Ah! Something like cockroaches?

389
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,822
I wondered what it was.

390
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:06,953
This is not a place inhabitable by humans.

391
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:09,708
Why are you making it sound so serious because of cockroaches.

392
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:13,143
Spray some insecticide. Or catch them by smashing them with some tissue.

393
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,483
You savage!

394
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:17,347
How can a woman catch insects so easily?

395
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:21,538
Seriously! Then learn to live &lt;br&gt;on good terms with the insects.

396
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,760
So, why were you being obstinate?

397
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,170
It would have been good if you followed me earlier.

398
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,416
Forget it!

399
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:30,873
Where are you now? &lt;br&gt;You aren’t at home, are you?

400
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:33,103
I’m at home.

401
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:34,736
Bull shit!

402
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:37,619
What? What did you say? &lt;br&gt;Bull shit?

403
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:40,814
Lee Tae Ik, you also use words like that?

404
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:41,999
You aren’t at home.

405
00:28:41,997 --> 00:28:43,657
I am at home.

406
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:46,557
How can you insist without seeing?

407
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,840
I can see you now.

408
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,585
What?

409
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,106
What is this?

410
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:05,913
Please…

411
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:07,958
What?

412
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,748
Please let me sleep here.

413
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:23,266
&lt;i&gt;Thanks for watching with us!&lt;br&gt;See you all next Monday!&lt;/i&gt;

414
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:28,173
&lt;i&gt; Would you like me to... stay here for a long time? &lt;/i&gt;

415
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:31,041
&lt;i&gt; I miss you... really! &lt;/i&gt;

416
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:32,424
&lt;i&gt; Pull yourself together, Jang Man Ok. &lt;/i&gt;

417
00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:35,696
&lt;i&gt; He is a star, a star! A star in the sky. You know? &lt;/i&gt;

418
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,431
&lt;i&gt;HEY!&lt;/i&gt;

419
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,190
&lt;i&gt; Come! Say hello! &lt;/i&gt;

420
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,969
&lt;i&gt; He is called "Sangsu-dong Wolf." &lt;/i&gt;

421
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:41,665
&lt;i&gt;Hyung-nim!&lt;/i&gt;

422
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,657
&lt;i&gt; You can't even sing. You only rely on your looks. &lt;/i&gt;

423
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:44,665
&lt;i&gt;Hey!&lt;/i&gt;

424
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:46,638
&lt;i&gt; I will do everything that you want. &lt;/i&gt;

425
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:48,938
&lt;i&gt; If you want to get back Full House,&lt;br&gt; I will also do that for you. &lt;/i&gt;

426
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,027
&lt;i&gt; The person who is next to me... &lt;br&gt;It is more important to guard that person. &lt;/i&gt;

427
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,080
&lt;i&gt; You fell in love. And, now you aren't even afraid of the President. &lt;/i&gt;

428
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:58,388
&lt;i&gt; Now, all sorts of useless people are getting me mad! &lt;/i&gt;

429
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:01,281
&lt;i&gt; Jang Man Ok, Grandpa is here. &lt;/i&gt;

1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,322
In this video we're going to
think a little bit about

2
00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:11,580
parallel lines, and other lines
that intersect the parallel

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,780
lines, and we call
those transversals.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,810
So first let's think about
what a parallel or what

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,490
parallel lines are.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,700
So one definition we could use,
and I think that'll work well

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,220
for the purposes of this video,
are they're two lines that

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,660
sit in the same plane.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,090
And when I talk about a plane,
I'm talking about a, you can

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,490
imagine a flat two-dimensional
surface like this screen --

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,910
this screen is a plane.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,730
So two lines that sit in a
plane that never intersect.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,570
So this line -- I'll try my
best to draw it -- and imagine

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,750
the line just keeps going in
that direction and that

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,280
direction -- let me do another
one in a different color --

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,050
and this line right
here are parallel.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,690
They will never intersect.

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,660
If you assume that I drew it
straight enough and that

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,000
they're going in the exact
same direction, they

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,840
will never intersect.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,070
And so if you think about what
types of lines are not

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,840
parallel, well, this green line
and this pink line

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,940
are not parallel.

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,940
They clearly intersect
at some point.

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,350
So these two guys are parallel
right over here, and sometimes

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,690
it's specified, sometimes
people will draw an arrow going

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,900
in the same direction to show
that those two lines

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,840
are parallel.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
If there are multiple parallel
lines, they might do two arrows

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
and two arrows or whatever.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,270
But you just have to say
OK, these lines will

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,550
never intersect.

33
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,060
What we want to think about
is what happens when

34
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,200
these parallel lines are
intersected by a third line.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,820
Let me draw the
third line here.

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,690
So third line like this.

37
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,970
And we call that, right there,
the third line that intersects

38
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:52,170
the parallel lines we
call a transversal line.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,150
Because it tranverses
the two parallel lines.

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,230
Now whenever you have a
transversal crossing parallel

41
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,190
lines, you have an interesting
relationship between

42
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,320
the angles form.

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,660
Now this shows up on a lot
of standardized tests.

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,200
It's kind of a core type
of a geometry problem.

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,450
So it's a good thing to really
get clear in our heads.

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,620
So the first thing to realize
is if these lines are parallel,

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,350
we're going to assume these
lines are parallel, then we

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,760
have corresponding angles
are going to be the same.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,820
What I mean by corresponding
angles are I guess you could

50
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,840
think there are four angles
that get formed when this

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,195
purple line or this
magenta line intersects

52
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,350
this yellow line.

53
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:38,070
You have this angle up here
that I've specified in green,

54
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,970
you have -- let me do another
one in orange -- you have this

55
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,280
angle right here in orange, you
have this angle right here in

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,600
this other shade of green, and
then you have this angle

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,290
right here -- right there
that I've made in that

58
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,930
bluish-purplish color.

59
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,790
So those are the four angles.

60
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,680
So when we talk about
corresponding angles, we're

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,770
talking about, for example,
this top right angle in green

62
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,930
up here, that corresponds to
this top right angle in, what

63
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,040
I can draw it in that same
green, right over here.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,570
These two angles
are corresponding.

65
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,990
These two are corresponding
angles and they're

66
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,520
going to be equal.

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,820
These are equal angles.

68
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,410
If this is -- I'll make up
a number -- if this is 70

69
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,880
degrees, then this angle
right here is also

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,410
going to be 70 degrees.

71
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,000
And if you just think about it,
or if you even play with

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,150
toothpicks or something, and
you keep changing the direction

73
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,140
of this transversal line,
you'll see that it actually

74
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,750
looks like they should
always be equal.

75
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,200
If I were to take -- let me
draw two other parallel

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,980
lines, let me show maybe
a more extreme example.

77
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,350
So if I have two other parallel
lines like that, and then let

78
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,340
me make a transversal that
forms a smaller -- it's even a

79
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,930
smaller angle here -- you see
that this angle right here

80
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,070
looks the same as that angle.

81
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,340
Those are corresponding angles
and they will be equivalent.

82
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,330
From this perspective it's kind
of the top right angle and each

83
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,430
intersection is the same.

84
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,600
Now the same is true of the
other corresponding angles.

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,660
This angle right here in this
example, it's the top left

86
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,120
angle will be the same as the
top left angle right over here.

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,080
This bottom left angle will
be the same down here.

88
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,000
If this right here is 70
degrees, then this down here

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,040
will also be 70 degrees.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,040
And then finally, of course,
this angle and this angle

91
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,990
will also be the same.

92
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,520
So corresponding angles -- let
me write these -- these are

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,170
corresponding angles
are congruent.

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:55,180
Corresponding angles are equal.

95
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,050
And that and that are
corresponding, that and

96
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,400
that, that and that,
and that and that.

97
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Now, the next set of equal
angles to realize are sometimes

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,610
they're called vertical angles,
sometimes they're called

99
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,440
opposite angles.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,700
But if you take this angle
right here, the angle that is

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,060
vertical to it or is opposite
as you go right across the

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,650
point of intersection is this
angle right here, and that is

103
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,580
going to be the same thing.

104
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,860
So we could say opposite -- I
like opposite because it's not

105
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,720
always in the vertical
direction, sometimes it's in

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,650
the horizontal direction, but
sometimes they're referred

107
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,400
to as vertical angles.

108
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:37,370
Opposite or vertical
angles are also equal.

109
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,940
So if that's 70 degrees, then
this is also 70 degrees.

110
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,980
And if this is 70 degrees,
then this right here

111
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,710
is also 70 degrees.

112
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,240
So it's interesting, if that's
70 degrees and that's 70

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,230
degrees, and if this is 70
degrees and that is also 70

114
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,750
degrees, so no matter what this
is, this will also be the same

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,060
thing because this is
the same as that, that

116
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,770
is the same as that.

117
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:07,180
Now, the last one that you need
to I guess kind of realize are

118
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,870
the relationship between
this orange angle and this

119
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,860
green angle right there.

120
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,890
You can see that when you add
up the angles, you go halfway

121
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,710
around a circle, right?

122
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,230
If you start here you do
the green angle, then

123
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,570
you do the orange angle.

124
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,600
You go halfway around the
circle, and that'll give you,

125
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,720
it'll get you to 180 degrees.

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,870
So this green and orange angle
have to add up to 180 degrees

127
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,710
or they are supplementary.

128
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,120
And we've done other videos on
supplementary, but you just

129
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
have to realize they form the
same line or a half circle.

130
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,990
So if this right here is 70
degrees, then this orange angle

131
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,720
right here is 110 degrees,
because they add up to 180.

132
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,320
Now, if this character right
here is 110 degrees, what

133
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,660
do we know about this
character right here?

134
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,370
Well, this character is
opposite or vertical

135
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,450
to the 110 degrees so
it's also 110 degrees.

136
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,370
We also know since this angle
corresponds with this angle,

137
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,360
this angle will also
be 110 degrees.

138
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,830
Or we could have said that
look, because this is 70 and

139
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,180
this guy is supplementary,
these guys have to add up to

140
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,180
180 so you could have
gotten it that way.

141
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,270
And you could also figure out
that since this is 110, this

142
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,300
is a corresponding angle,
it is also going to be 110.

143
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,190
Or you could have said
this is opposite to

144
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,430
that so they're equal.

145
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,800
Or you could have said that
this is supplementary with

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,150
that angle, so 70 plus
110 have to be 180.

147
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,600
Or you could have said 70
plus this angle are 180.

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,810
So there's a bunch of ways
to come to figure out

149
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,740
which angle is which.

150
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,000
In the next video I'm just
going to do a bunch of examples

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,990
just to show that if you know
one of these angles, you

152
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,880
can really figure out
all of the angles.

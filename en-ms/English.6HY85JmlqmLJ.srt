1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I am going to ask you about the problem to learn about a loaded coin.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A loaded coin is a coin,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that if you flip it,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
might have a non 0.5 chance

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of coming up heads or tails.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fair coins always come up 50% heads or tails.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Loaded coins might come up, for example,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
0.9 chance heads and 0.1 chance tails.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Your task will be to understand,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
from coin flips,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
whether a coin is loaded,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and if so, at what probability.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't want you to solve the problem,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but I want you to answer the following questions:

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is it partially observable?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes or no.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is it stochastic?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes or no.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is it continuous? [Yes or no.]

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And finally, is it adversarial?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes or no.

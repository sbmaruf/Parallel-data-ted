1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
We're told that as part of an
experiment about train speed,

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,860
4 different train conductors
measured the distance that

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,380
they covered over a certain
amount of time

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,650
during a recent journey.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,300
So these are the 4 trains.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,260
This is how long it took them
to go this many miles.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,460
However, they all use different
time intervals.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,910
Yeah, you see this guy, he
did it over half an hour.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,740
This guy did it over 2 hours.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,890
And they're having a difficult
time comparing their data.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,080
According to the data provided,
were all 4 trains

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,330
moving at the same speed
during the experiment?

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,660
So we just have to figure out
what was the speed of all of

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,790
these 4 trains based on
how far they went in

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,300
this amount of time.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,170
And just to remind us, you might
already know this, but

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,050
you know that distance is equal
to rate times time.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,300
Or if you were to divide both
sides of this equation by

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,610
time, I could do that.

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,770
If you divide both sides by
time, the times cancel out and

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,295
you get rate is equal to
distance divided by time.

23
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:08,430

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,850
Rate is the same thing as speed,
and it makes sense that

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,720
it's distance divided by time.

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,400
You've heard miles per hour
or meter per second or

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,440
kilometers per hour.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,660
Rate speed is distance
divided by time.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,100
So we can just use this.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,270
We can just divide the distance
by the time for each

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,250
of these trains and figure
out what their speed was.

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,510
So let's do that.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,710
So let's write their speeds.

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,160
I'll make another column for
their speed right here.

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,260
So what's this first guy?

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,650
He went 27.5 miles
in 0.5 hours.

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,620
So once again, let's divide the
distance for this train 1.

38
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,815
He went 27.5 miles in 0.5.

39
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:58,470
So if you divide something by
0.5, this is the same thing as

40
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,810
27.5 times 2.

41
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,790
Let me do it this
way, times 2.

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,840
What's 27.5 times 2?

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,920
It is 55, and it is
miles per hour.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,120
So his speed is 55
miles per hour.

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,610
Now, this guy, this is pretty
straightforward.

46
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,620
He went 55 miles in
exactly 1 hour.

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,380
The distance divided
by time is 55.

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,020
So this guy's pretty
straightforward.

49
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,630
He's also 55.

50
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,990
And you can put it
in the formula.

51
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,780
55 is the distance.

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,320
The time is 1 hour.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,450
55 over 1.

54
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,440
55 miles per hour.

55
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,600
Now this guy went 82-1/2
miles in 1-1/2 hours.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,840
Let's see what that is.

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,210
So he went 82-1/2 miles
in 1.5 hours.

58
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,530
So let's figure out
what this is.

59
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,120
And I'll have to do a little bit
of decimal long division

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,020
to do this.

61
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:01,950
So we have 1.5 goes into 82.5.

62
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,020
Let's multiply both of these
numbers by 10, essentially

63
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,810
shift their decimals one
over, so shift that

64
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,730
decimal over here.

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,360
So it becomes 15 goes into
825 how many times?

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,000
So 15 doesn't go
into 8 at all.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,540
It goes into 82 five times.

68
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,040
5 times 5 is 25, carry the 2.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,460
5 times 1 is 5, plus 2 is 70.

70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,590
Subtract 75.

71
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,310
82 minus 75 is just
a 7, right?

72
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,560
And then you bring
down this 5.

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,570
15 goes into 75 five
times exactly.

74
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,680
5 times 15 is 75.

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,620
Subtract, no remainder.

76
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,700
So 82.5 miles in an hour
and a half is also

77
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,620
55 miles per hour.

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,280
And then finally, if you do 110
miles 2 hours, 110 divided

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,990
by 2 is 55.

80
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,930
So they did indeed all go, or
they all did move at the same

81
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,380
speed during the experiment.

82
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,333

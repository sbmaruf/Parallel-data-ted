1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,470
Let's do some compound
inequality problems, and these

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,450
are just inequality problems
that have more than one set of

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,060
constraints.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,020
You're going to see what I'm
talking about in a second.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,110
So the first problem I have is
negative 5 is less than or

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:22,300
equal to x minus 4, which is
also less than or equal to 13.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,640
So we have two sets of
constraints on the set of x's

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,426
that satisfy these equations.

9
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:31,270
x minus 4 has to be greater than
or equal to negative 5

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,240
and x minus 4 has to be less
than or equal to 13.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,180
So we could rewrite this
compound inequality as

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:49,040
negative 5 has to be less than
or equal to x minus 4, and x

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:57,800
minus 4 needs to be less
than or equal to 13.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,990
And then we could solve each of
these separately, and then

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,220
we have to remember this "and"
there to think about the

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,069
solution set because it has to
be things that satisfy this

17
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,200
equation and this equation.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,660
So let's solve each of
them individually.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,430
So this one over here,
we can add 4 to both

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,680
sides of the equation.

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,840
The left-hand side, negative
5 plus 4, is negative 1.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,120
Negative 1 is less than
or equal to x, right?

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,850
These 4's just cancel out here
and you're just left with an x

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,620
on this right-hand side.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:37,120
So the left, this part right
here, simplifies to x needs to

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,780
be greater than or equal to
negative 1 or negative 1 is

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,280
less than or equal to x.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,580
So we can also write
it like this.

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,110
X needs to be greater than
or equal to negative 1.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,950
These are equivalent.

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,800
I just swapped the sides.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,506
Now let's do this other
condition here in green.

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,910
Let's add 4 to both sides
of this equation.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,330
The left-hand side,
we just get an x.

35
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,380
And then the right-hand
side, we get 13 plus

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,840
14, which is 17.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,800
So we get x is less than
or equal to 17.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,970
So our two conditions, x has to
be greater than or equal to

39
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,310
negative 1 and less than
or equal to 17.

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,460
So we could write this
again as a compound

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,700
inequality if we want.

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,470
We can say that the solution
set, that x has to be less

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,950
than or equal to 17 and greater
than or equal to

44
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,550
negative 1.

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,750
It has to satisfy both
of these conditions.

46
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,676
So what would that look
like on a number line?

47
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:46,250
So let's put our number
line right there.

48
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,590
Let's say that this is 17.

49
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,090
Maybe that's 18.

50
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,040
You keep going down.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,180
Maybe this is 0.

52
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm obviously skipping a bunch
of stuff in between.

53
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,650
Then we would have a negative
1 right there, maybe a

54
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,920
negative 2.

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,630
So x is greater than or equal
to negative 1, so we would

56
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,610
start at negative 1.

57
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,000
We're going to circle it in
because we have a greater than

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
or equal to.

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,440
And then x is greater than that,
but it has to be less

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,580
than or equal to 17.

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,170
So it could be equal to
17 or less than 17.

62
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,650
So this right here is a solution
set, everything that

63
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,710
I've shaded in orange.

64
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,850
And if we wanted to write it in
interval notation, it would

65
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,030
be x is between negative 1 and
17, and it can also equal

66
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,120
negative 1, so we put
a bracket, and it

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,510
can also equal 17.

68
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,350
So this is the interval notation
for this compound

69
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,330
inequality right there.

70
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,580
Let's do another one.

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,980
Let me get a good
problem here.

72
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,620
Let's say that we have
negative 12.

73
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm going to change the problem
a little bit from the

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,270
one that I've found here.

75
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:08,230
Negative 12 is less than 2 minus
5x, which is less than

76
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,230
or equal to 7.

77
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,950
I want to do a problem that has
just the less than and a

78
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,630
less than or equal to.

79
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,709
The problem in the book that
I'm looking at has an equal

80
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,600
sign here, but I want to remove
that intentionally

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,500
because I want to show you
when you have a hybrid

82
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,390
situation, when you have
a little bit of both.

83
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,310
So first we can separate this
into two normal inequalities.

84
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,940
You have this inequality
right there.

85
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,530
We know that negative 12 needs
to be less than 2 minus 5x.

86
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,230
That has to be satisfied, and--
let me do it in another

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,810
color-- this inequality also
needs to be satisfied.

88
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,740
2 minus 5x has to be less than
7 and greater than 12, less

89
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,530
than or equal to 7 and greater
than negative 12, so and 2

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,140
minus 5x has to be less
than or equal to 7.

91
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,290
So let's just solve this the
way we solve everything.

92
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,050
Let's get this 2 onto the
left-hand side here.

93
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,730
So let's subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation.

94
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,500
So if you subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, the

95
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,560
left-hand side becomes negative
14, is less than--

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,830
these cancel out-- less
than negative 5x.

97
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,140
Now let's divide both
sides by negative 5.

98
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,360
And remember, when you multiply
or divide by a

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,140
negative number, the inequality
swaps around.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,880
So if you divide both sides by
negative 5, you get a negative

101
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,980
14 over negative 5, and you have
an x on the right-hand

102
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,140
side, if you divide that by
negative 5, and this swaps

103
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,920
from a less than sign to
a greater than sign.

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,560
The negatives cancel out, so you
get 14/5 is greater than

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,580
x, or x is less than 14/5,
which is-- what is this?

106
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,380
This is 2 and 4/5.

107
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,320
x is less than 2 and 4/5.

108
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,090
I just wrote this improper
fraction as a mixed number.

109
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,620
Now let's do the other
constraint

110
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,630
over here in magenta.

111
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,210
So let's subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, just

112
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,800
like we did before.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,910
And actually, you can do these
simultaneously, but it becomes

114
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,770
kind of confusing.

115
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,360
So to avoid careless mistakes, I
encourage you to separate it

116
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,650
out like this.

117
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,300
So if you subtract 2 from both
sides of the equation, the

118
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,680
left-hand side becomes
negative 5x.

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,100
The right-hand side, you have
less than or equal to.

120
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,620
The right-hand side becomes
7 minus 2, becomes 5.

121
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,780
Now, you divide both sides
by negative 5.

122
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,370
On the left-hand side,
you get an x.

123
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,450
On the right-hand side, 5
divided by negative 5 is

124
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,600
negative 1.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,440
And since we divided by a
negative number, we swap the

126
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,380
inequality.

127
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,310
It goes from less than or
equal to, to greater

128
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,610
than or equal to.

129
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,820
So we have our two
constraints.

130
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,510
x has to be less than 2 and 4/5,
and it has to be greater

131
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,720
than or equal to negative 1.

132
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
So we could write
it like this.

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,300
x has to be greater than or
equal to negative 1, so that

134
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,390
would be the lower bound on our
interval, and it has to be

135
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,940
less than 2 and 4/5.

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,590
And notice, not less
than or equal to.

137
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,510
That's why I wanted to show you,
you have the parentheses

138
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,810
there because it can't be
equal to 2 and 4/5.

139
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,580
x has to be less
than 2 and 4/5.

140
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,502
Or we could write this way.

141
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:37,010
x has to be less than 2 and
4/5, that's just this

142
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,540
inequality, swapping the
sides, and it has to be

143
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,670
greater than or equal
to negative 1.

144
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,210
So these two statements
are equivalent.

145
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,040
And if I were to draw it
on a number line, it

146
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,490
would look like this.

147
00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,410
So you have a negative 1, you
have 2 and 4/5 over here.

148
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,850
Obviously, you'll have
stuff in between.

149
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,580
Maybe, you know, 0
sitting there.

150
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,640
We have to be greater than or
equal to negative 1, so we can

151
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,100
be equal to negative 1.

152
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,220
And we're going to be greater
than negative 1, but we also

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,700
have to be less than
2 and 4/5.

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,780
So we can't include
2 and 4/5 there.

155
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,100
We can't be equal to 2 and 4/5,
so we can only be less

156
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,590
than, so we put a empty circle
around 2 and 4/5 and then we

157
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,960
fill in everything below that,
all the way down to negative

158
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,580
1, and we include negative 1
because we have this less than

159
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,120
or equal sign.

160
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,820
So the last two problems I did
are kind of "and" problems.

161
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,419
You have to meet both of
these constraints.

162
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,025
Now, let's do an "or" problem.

163
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,620
So let's say I have these
inequalities.

164
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,910
Let's say I'm given-- let's say
that 4x minus 1 needs to

165
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:58,770
be greater than or equal to
7, or 9x over 2 needs to

166
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,290
be less than 3.

167
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,460
So now when we're saying "or,"
an x that would satisfy these

168
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,400
are x's that satisfy either
of these equations.

169
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,250
In the last few videos or in the
last few problems, we had

170
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,770
to find x's that satisfied
both of these equations.

171
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,260
Here, this is much
more lenient.

172
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,780
We just have to satisfy
one of these two.

173
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,140
So let's figure out the solution
sets for both of

174
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,680
these and then we figure out
essentially their union, their

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,980
combination, all of
the things that'll

176
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,100
satisfy either of these.

177
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,010
So on this one, on the one
on the left, we can

178
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,490
add 1 to both sides.

179
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,440
You add 1 to both sides.

180
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,480
The left-hand side just becomes
4x is greater than or

181
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,840
equal to 7 plus 1 is 8.

182
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,120
Divide both sides by 4.

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,120
You get x is greater
than or equal to 2.

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,790
Or let's do this one.

185
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,770
Let's see, if we multiply both
sides of this equation by 2/9,

186
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,070
what do we get?

187
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,070
If you multiply both sides by
2/9, it's a positive number,

188
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,570
so we don't have to do anything
to the inequality.

189
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:06,760
These cancel out, and you get
x is less than 3 times 2/9.

190
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,610
3/9 is the same thing as
1/3, so x needs to

191
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,460
be less than 2/3.

192
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,280
So or x is less than 2/3.

193
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,840
So that's our solution set.

194
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,240
x needs to be greater than or
equal to 2, or less than 2/3.

195
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,340
So this is interesting.

196
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,920
Let me plot the solution
set on the number line.

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,380
So that is our number line.

198
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:41,630
Maybe this is 0, this is 1, this
is 2, 3, maybe that is

199
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,940
negative 1.

200
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,910
So x can be greater than
or equal to 2.

201
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,960
So we could start-- let me
do it in another color.

202
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,320
We can start at 2 here and it
would be greater than or equal

203
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,690
to 2, so include everything
greater than or equal to 2.

204
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,530
That's that condition
right there.

205
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,440
Or x could be less than 2/3.

206
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,120
So 2/3 is going to be right
around here, right?

207
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,680
That is 2/3.

208
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,850
x could be less than 2/3.

209
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,150
And this is interesting.

210
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,490
Because if we pick one of these
numbers, it's going to

211
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,020
satisfy this inequality.

212
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,840
If we pick one of these numbers,
it's going to satisfy

213
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,850
that inequality.

214
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,500
If we had an "and" here, there
would have been no numbers

215
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,420
that satisfy it because you
can't be both greater than 2

216
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,630
and less than 2/3.

217
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,020
So the only way that there's
any solution set here is

218
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,740
because it's "or." You can
satisfy one of the two

219
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,920
inequalities.

220
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
Anyway, hopefully you,
found that fun.

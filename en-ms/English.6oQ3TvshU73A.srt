1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You are a miracle

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You are a blessing from above

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You brought joy to my soul

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And pleasure to my eyes

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In my heart I can feel it

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
An unexplainable feeling

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Being a father

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The best thing that I could ever ask for

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just thinking of you, makes me smile

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Holding you, looking in your eyes

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm so grateful for having you

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And everyday I pray

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I pray that you'll find your way

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You know I love you

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I love you

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My little girl, my little girl

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I ask God to bless you, and protect you always

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My little girl, my little girl

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're like a shining star

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So beautiful you are

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My baby girl

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You light up my world

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I pray that I'll get the chance

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
To be around and watch you grow

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And witness your first steps

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And the first time when you will call me dad

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Just thinking of you, makes me smile

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Holding you, looking in your eyes

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so grateful for having you

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And everyday I pray

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I pray that you'll find your way

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You know I love you

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I love you

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My little girl, my little girl

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I ask God to bless you, and protect you always

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My little girl, my little girl

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I could spend hours watching you

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're so innocent, so lovely and so pure

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, God I can not express my gratitude

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ohh, but i'll raise her good, cause all I want is to please you

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And now I pray, You'll guide her ways forever

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know I love you

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I love you

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My little girl, my little girl

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I ask God to bless you, and protect you always

46
00:04:25,000 --> 99:59:59,000
My little girl, my little girl

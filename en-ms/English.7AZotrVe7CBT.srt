1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540


2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,820
Determine whether
30/45 and 54/81

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,090
are equivalent fractions.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,039
Well, the easiest way I can
think of doing this is to put

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,040
both of these fractions into
lowest possible terms, and

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,460
then if they're the same
fraction, then they're

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,460
equivalent.

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:21,510
So 30/45, what's the largest
factor of both 30 and 45?

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,850
15 will go into 30.

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,070
It'll also go into 45.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,030
So this is the same thing.

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:32,310
30 is 2 times 15 and
45 is 3 times 15.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,170
So we can divide both the
numerator and the

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,810
denominator by 15.

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,640
So if we divide both the
numerator and the denominator

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,690
by 15, what happens?

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,740
Well, this 15 divided by 15,
they cancel out, this 15

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,520
divided by 15 cancel out, and
we'll just be left with 2/3.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,490
So 30/45 is the same
thing as 2/3.

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,880
It's equivalent to 2/3.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,550
2/3 is in lowest possible terms,
or simplified form,

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,770
however you want to
think about it.

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:12,210
Now, let's try to do 54/81.

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,320
Now, let's see.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,020
Nothing really jumps
out at me.

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,580
Let's see, 9 is divisible
into both of these.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,840
We could write 54 as being 6
times 9, and 81 is the same

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,870
thing as 9 times 9.

29
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,470
You can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 9.

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,970
So we could divide both
of them by 9.

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,530
9 divided by 9 is 1, 9 divided
by 9 is 1, so we get this as

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,900
being equal to 6/9.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,170
Now, let's see.

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,590
6 is the same thing
as 2 times 3.

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,610
9 is the same thing
as 3 times 3.

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,280
We could just cancel these 3's
out, or you could imagine this

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,530
is the same thing as dividing
both the numerator and the

38
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,880
denominator by 3, or multiplying
both the numerator

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,380
and the denominator by 1/3.

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,930
These are all equivalent.

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,400
I could write divide by
3 or multiply by 1/3.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,832
Actually, let me write
divide by 3.

43
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,860
Let me write divide
by 3 for now.

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,440
I don't want to assume you
know how to multiply

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,070
fractions, because we're going
to learn that in the future.

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,900
So we're going to divide by 3.

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,830
3 divided by 3 is just 1.

48
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,530
3 divided by 3 is 1, and
you're left with 2/3.

49
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,305
So both of these fractions, when
you simplify them, when

50
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:25,470
you put them in simplified form,
both end up being 2/3,

51
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,350
so they are equivalent
fractions.

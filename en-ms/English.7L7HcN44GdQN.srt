Episode 8

3
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:20,433
<i>The shining era of high school has passed, and I have become a 20-year-old.

4
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:25,267
<i>The reason that that time in high school was shining...

5
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:29,005
<i>because of Baek Seung Jo.ุง

6
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:36,741
<i>I am going to have fun. I am going to live happily.

7
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:39,413
<i>Oh Ha Ni?

8
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:42,216
<i>I'm asking you if you're Oh Ha Ni.

9
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:48,006
<i>To put it simply, I hate stupid girls.

10
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,867
<i> You, you! Why did you come out from there?

11
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:55,219
<i>Because it's my house.

12
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,000
<i> I can't believe it! To be having breakfast with Baek Seung Jo.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,933
<i>What to do?

14
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:08,133
<i>Logx = log (2^30 * 10^-7),

15
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:13,833
<i>logx = 30log2 - 7log10logx=30*0.3-7

16
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,006
<i>For this problem we use f=ma.

17
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:22,027
<i> Good luck.

18
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:25,933
<i> This one.

19
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,085
<i>Thank you.

20
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:30,733
<i>What is this?

21
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,967
<i>Oh Ha Ni!

22
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,901
<i>Hey! Oh Ha Ni!

23
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,008
<i>Hey!Hey!

24
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,967
<i>Hey!

25
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,063
<i> What I said about you being a pain,

26
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:44,104
<i> Weren't just empty words. Ever since I met you, I did not have one quiet day.

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,933
<i> I told you to stop this. To not mess with my life anymore. How far do you intend to take this?

28
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,006
<i>Please just knock it off!

29
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:59,003
<i>Even though he's cold, I cannot stop my feelings towards him.

30
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:10,167
<i>That's because I'm a persevering snail heading towards Seung Jo.

31
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:20,003
<i> You're amazing, Oh Ha Ni.

32
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:23,033
<i> You want to drink some water?

33
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:35,167
<i>Come here.

34
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,133
<i>Your girlfriend?

35
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,001
<i>There's no way.

36
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,001
<i> What does he mean "There is no way"?

37
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:44,933
<i> You and Oh Ha Ni are very well suited.

38
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:51,967
<i> Now, it's time I let go of my feelings.

39
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:58,076
<i>Let's move out Ha Ni.

40
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:01,001
<i>Good bye...

41
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:39,867
<i>Baek Seung Jo.

42
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:44,001
What were you looking at?

43
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,167
The street down there.

44
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,767
People walking by and the alley... it's fun.

45
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,667
It's refreshing.

46
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:59,433
We'll stay here, and then we'll find a new house. Even though it's uncomfortable, just bear with it for a little while.

47
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,167
I'm alright.

48
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,004
It's fine, and I really like this neighborhood.

49
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:08,007
Since it's an old neighborhood,and it's a little emotional.

50
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right. it definitely seems homey.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,033
Yup there is definitely

52
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,098
Let's go eat.

53
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:35,133
Yes.

54
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,001
Ha Ni, you came down?

55
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,245
Yeah...

56
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:44,007
Just wait a bit, I'll make it right away.

57
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:47,767
Here.

58
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:51,567
I knew you would come back!

59
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:56,233
I didn't know that we would be together this soon though.

60
00:04:56,233 --> 00:05:00,267
You rascal, what do you mean by being together, huh?

61
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,733
Hey, give me a plate.

62
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:06,167
Ha Ni this is called yeongbap. Come on and try it.

63
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:10,167
Father, we eat and breathe together both upstairs and downstairs. If it's not being together then what is it?

64
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:16,233
If you're going to keep drinking Kim Chi soup and make things chaotic then just leave!

65
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:26,002
Father, how could you say something so sad. I...

66
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,006
Eat.

67
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:51,000
Should I open it for you?

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Have a meal.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,233
But I don't have any appetite.

70
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:58,067
Don't just stay at home, go outside, take some photos.

71
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,167
And meet your friends.

72
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,009
Because you keep staying at home.

73
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:09,967
I don't even have anything I want to do.

74
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:14,767
Are you okay? Isn't there anything wrong with you?

75
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:21,006
I'm great, very peaceful.

76
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,667
Peace?

77
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:27,467
What's the peace that you're talking about?

78
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:31,004
Not having anything you don't expect?

79
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:33,967
Being everything by yourself?

80
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:38,433
Isn't that why you were so quiet and suffocating in your own bubble?

81
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:52,007
Not going to DaeSun University and going toParang University,didn't you do that because you hated the peace?

82
00:06:52,007 --> 00:07:04,833
Please try this.

83
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:09,433
Our Ha Ni is so out of it right now that...

84
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:14,433
I'm a bit worried.

85
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,067
Don't you think I should cheer her up by giving her a call?

86
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,008
This late?

87
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:21,333
This rascal.

88
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:28,267
Ha Ni is the prettiest when she's smiling. I'm just saying this because she's always sad now.

89
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:33,267
I'll make her return to a smiling face at once...

90
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:38,007
Couldn't you allow us to go on a night date?

91
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,233
You can make her return to a smiling face?

92
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,867
Ah, of course.

93
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,033
Will you allow it?

94
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,000
Then well...

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,367
Yes.

96
00:07:53,367 --> 00:08:14,667
Ha Ni...

97
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:19,008
<i>Not available to answer the call. After the beep....

98
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,433
Ah, why?

99
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,367
She didn't answer.

100
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:27,167
Really?

101
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,007
Aigoo...

102
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:32,333
For the time being, dad said to split up some of the house chores.

103
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,667
Really?

104
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:37,299
Hyung, you have the cleaning, dishwashing, and the cooking.

105
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,967
What?!

106
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:39,967
I'm doing it all?

107
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:43,003
Should a young kid like me have to do it?

108
00:08:43,003 --> 00:09:29,733
Dad has to go to work...

109
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,006
<i>You're going to take the test tomorrow, right?

110
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:37,967
<i>You can do everything.

111
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:43,004
<i>You have to use your brains to benefit people.

112
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:49,967
<i>I think people who has a lot should share what he has.

113
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,133


114
00:09:52,133 --> 00:10:05,853
Good luck on your test! FIGHTING!!

115
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:09,443
I thought that you would always live in that house.

116
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,447
You're losing your advantage little by little.

117
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,748
It's fine, I don't need it now.

118
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,256
I really gave up Baek Seung Jo.

119
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:19,856
What?

120
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:22,051
Really?

121
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,025
You, the one that was so stubborn?

122
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,539
I'm a different person now than I was before.

123
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,261
Because I realized that there's nothing more I can do.

124
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,000
I won't go chasing after Baek Seung Jo again.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,847
Ha Ni.

126
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,223
I've talked about it with dad,

127
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:40,667
and closed my heart against him.

128
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,542
Now, I will look for a really

129
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,961
cool boyfriend.

130
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:49,244
Really?

131
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:56,082
<i>Good-bye, Baek Seung Jo.

132
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:59,314
Hey! Let's go have lunch.

133
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:01,079
I came out without the dean knowing. I have to quickly eat and go back.

134
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,815
Right. I'm hungry.

135
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:07,386
I don't feel like it. You guys go ahead.

136
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:08,825
Oh Ha Ni.

137
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:11,108
Because you're being like this, you don't seem like the Oh Ha Ni I know.

138
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:16,209
Is it because you're afraid that if you go to the cafeteria you might meet Baek Seung Jo?

139
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,406
If I see Seung Jo,

140
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,271
my heart might waver again.

141
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,482
I really can't hold you back.

142
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,165
I wonder if you won't be able to meet another guy because you're like this.

143
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,521
Even so...

144
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,768
I'll eat later!

145
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:36,001
Hey Oh Ha Ni. If you made your decision, then it's a good thing to run into him often.

146
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,041
That way you can build tolerance.

147
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,333
Do you think you won't run into him when you go to the same school?

148
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,962
That's right! Dok Go Min Ah said something right.

149
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,727
It's actually good to meet him first.

150
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,081
Let's go. I'm hungry! Let's go quickly!

151
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:52,067
Let's go! Let's go!

152
00:11:52,067 --> 00:12:14,267
What do you want to have? Huh?

153
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:18,867
Omo!

154
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,133
[Oh Ha Ni grew tired of Baek Seung Jo and broke up!]

155
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,292
It's now time for a lovely mood with Bong Joon Goo.

156
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,006
Did you see above?

157
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:27,593
Please spread the word.

158
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:30,918
Even if you see someone you don't know, tell them about it.

159
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,004
Next order!

160
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:33,826
- Gogi dub bap please <Br> - Gogi dup bap right here

161
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:36,004
Hey Bong Joon Gu, what are you doing?!

162
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:38,001
Ha Ni, you came. What do you want to eat today?

163
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,767
The Gogi Dup Bap (meat on top of rice) is really good today. Eat that.

164
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,866
Hey Bong Joon Gu! I'm not in the mood to play around.

165
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,004
Hey Bong Joon Gu, you're causing an incident.

166
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:48,633
Hey Bong Joon Gu, what are you thinking? If Baek Seung Jo sees this, what will Ha Ni become?

167
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:52,467
Baek Seung Jo? He already saw it.

168
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,000
He's over there.

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,533
What?!

170
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,009
This is completely cheesy.

171
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,005
I'd probably get sick of it too.

172
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:11,003
You must get really tired, Baek Seung Jo.

173
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,009
Is this possibly a struggle to change Baek Seung Jo's interests?

174
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,433
Hey girl! What did you just say?

175
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,133
No.

176
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,433
I forgot Seung Jo.

177
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,333
Baek Seung Jo has nothing to do with me anymore.

178
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,004
We don't live in one house anymore...

179
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,433
Just...

180
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:36,233
We're strangers now.

181
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,009
Our Ha Ni is speaking well!

182
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:55,008
Hey Baek Seung Jo, you heard right? You heard correctly right?

183
00:13:55,008 --> 00:14:19,833
Ha Ni ah! You're not going to eat Gogi Dup Bap?

184
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,002
Hey Oh Ha Ni!

185
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,866
Why are you being so sluggish?

186
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,433
Hurry up and bring the balls.

187
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:28,633
I'm really tired. Just a little...

188
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:32,367
What did you do that you're so tired? Stop talking and bring the balls.

189
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,633
Hurry!

190
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,833
Sunbaenim.

191
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,467
That racket...

192
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:43,000
Could you put it down when you talk?

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,367
What?

194
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:57,833
It's nothing.

195
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,003
I heard you're still just picking up the balls.

196
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,567
Why... did you come?

197
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,004
Why would I have come?

198
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm part of the staff here too.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,007
No...

200
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,067
That's that.

201
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:17,167
<i>I'm trying so hard to suppress my feelings. I'm not even attending classes.

202
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,005
<i>But if you just come like this, what am I supposed to do?

203
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:23,233
Ha Ni ah. Ha Ni ah.

204
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:26,467
Seung Jo. You're here, I have something to say to you.

205
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:32,133
Next Friday and Saturday, our Top Spin Club is going on an MT for two nights and three days. Let's go together.

206
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,967
I don't want to.

207
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,233
Why?

208
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:40,133
I came on the condition where I could come only if I wanted to.

209
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:46,633
Seung Jo ah.

210
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:50,833
Since we're players, should we make a bet with a match?

211
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,633
If you win, you don't have to go. And if I win, you go.

212
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,667
Let's go outside and have a game. What do you think about that ?

213
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,009
I don't care...

214
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:02,733
But will you really be okay?

215
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,333
Ah brat.

216
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,008
I know that you play well.

217
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:10,133
Let's just try it for fun.

218
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:13,000
Let's do a dual match. That sounds fun.

219
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,767
You and Ha Ni on one team.

220
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:18,933
-Pardon?-Pardon?

221
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,933
Then I... uh...

222
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:36,733
Should I play with Yoon Hae Ra?

223
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,006
Is your brother upstairs?

224
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:40,633
No.

225
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,667
He's not there. Where did he go?

226
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:47,733
He said he didn't have class today, so he was going to stay home and read.

227
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:51,005
Earlier, he was holding a tennis bag and left.

228
00:16:51,005 --> 00:17:03,967
Ahh, he went to the Tennis Club.

229
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:08,667
Have you been well? Yeah I'm Seung Jo's mom.

230
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:12,233
I've gotten curious about something.

231
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:17,006
Do you know what club Ha Ni signed up for?

232
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:31,005
Oh my! Really?!

233
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:35,003
Oh excuse me. Where can I find the Tennis Club?

234
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:38,004
I came to meet a student named Oh Ha Ni.

235
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:42,009
You probably don't know Oh Ha Ni. The club's name is Top Spin.

236
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,167
Ah Oh Ha Ni?

237
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,767
Oh my! You know Oh Ha Ni?

238
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:50,002
Something about her breaking up with Baek Seung Jo... there was some commotion at the cafeteria.

239
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,467
Oh my, what?!

240
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,833
What kind of rumor is that?

241
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,167
That is all a lie!

242
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,007
Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni will never break up.

243
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,967
Those two people are doing fine!

244
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,533
You students tell the others too!

245
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:04,667
But then, who are you ma'am??

246
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,713
Who's that lady?

247
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:10,781
Excuse me. Where should I go to find the Tennis Club?

248
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:14,248
Ah wait a min...

249
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,215
Possibly, Seung Jo's mother?

250
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,981
Ah I was right! Hello.

251
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:22,281
Oh Joo Ri, Min Ah! Nice to see you!

252
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,581
What's going on? Wearing those kinds of clothes...

253
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:29,348
Oh, I was trying to disguise. Does it show??

254
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:32,048
It's very obvious.

255
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:35,915
Did you come to watch Ha Ni play tennis?

256
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,058
When you watch the Wimbledon matches,

257
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:43,781
Sharapova wears those white tennis uniforms.

258
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:45,248
And she does the swishing!

259
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:49,515
Imagining Ha Ni do that, could I just sit at home?

260
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:52,415
Where are they playing? Let's hurry up and go watch.

261
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:55,381
I think the practice is over now.

262
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:56,381
It's over?

263
00:18:56,381 --> 00:19:01,315
Later tonight, Ha Ni and Seung Jo will be playing tennis on one team.

264
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:03,348
What's up with being on the same side as Seung Jo?

265
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:07,581
Yeah. Ha Ni is desperately trying to forget Seung Jo.

266
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,048
Oh my. What are you talking about?

267
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:15,281
Actually, I thought everything was going to be okay between Ha Ni and Seung Jo.

268
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,915
I thought that way too. Think about it.

269
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,098
After graduation, they...

270
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:23,346
They even kissed.

271
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,648
What?!

272
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:26,081
KISS!!!

273
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,446
That was on the night of graduation.

274
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:36,548
And, Baek Seung Jo did it first!

275
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:39,113
Awesome!

276
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,981
Seung Jo, really!

277
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:45,181
After doing that... why?!

278
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,713
I've made my decision.

279
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:50,081
I'm going to have Ha Ni back at our house.

280
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:54,028
Even if Seung Jo says something, it doesn't matter.

281
00:19:54,028 --> 00:20:01,048
They even kissed.

282
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:10,381
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

283
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:13,715
We're going to lose anyways. So just tell them you're going to the MT.

284
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,846
You're saying to give up now?

285
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,981
Listen carefully.

286
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:22,613
You just run the opposite way from the ball.

287
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:23,815
Don't get in my way.

288
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:41,796
Understood?

289
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:44,814
Just pretend that I'm not here

290
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:48,955
Don't serve me any balls, okay?

291
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:52,461
I want to go with Seung Jo to the MT.

292
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,952
So I don't intend to go easy on you.

293
00:20:54,952 --> 00:21:01,467
Show me what you've got.

294
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:06,961
PLAY.

295
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,392
I told you to not get in my way!

296
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,626
Sorry.

297
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:16,926
0 - 15

298
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:20,867
Ah, come on!

299
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:36,693
Hey! Don't come, don't come.

300
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:40,301
Advantage. Wang Kyung Su and Yoon Hae Ra.

301
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:44,332
This time, if we don't get the point.

302
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:46,176
It will be the game set.

303
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:51,565
Keep your mind on the game Oh Ha Ni. Got it?

304
00:21:51,565 --> 00:22:02,387
Then, this is the last one.

305
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,477
Game set. Wang Kyung Soo and Yoon Hae Ra's win.

306
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,099
Yes! We won, we won!

307
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:14,577
That punk!

308
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:15,953
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.

309
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:17,653
Thanks to you, ever since the day I was born,

310
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:20,184
this is the first time I ever lost.

311
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,011
Feels very refreshing.

312
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,406
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:25,628
That's why, from the start...

314
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,004
Aigoo, Mr. Baek Seung Jo

315
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,776
Oh, your pride must have been hurt a lot.

316
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:32,376
Is this the first time you've lost?

317
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:35,086
I'd like to pay you back sometime.

318
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:35,899
Really?

319
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,383
I'm cool, whenever you want.

320
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:43,909
However, we'll stay teamed the same way we are now.

321
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,083
How about having it when we go on the MT?

322
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,731
Huh?

323
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,526
But the MT is next week.

324
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:56,078
Right, no matter how much of a genius you might be, 1 week is pushing it.... right?

325
00:22:56,078 --> 00:23:00,653
Fine. Let's try it out.

326
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:04,313
On the last day of the MT. Call

327
00:23:04,313 --> 00:23:20,509
Call!

328
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,773
We have only one week.

329
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:26,123
After one week, we'll win, for sure.

330
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:28,901
Do you understand?

331
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:29,901
Does that make any sense?

332
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:32,625
When did you ever know what makes sense or not?

333
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,549
When you asked me to raise you to the top 50 students,

334
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:52,955
Where'd that attitude go?

335
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:56,379
Now, spread your legs shoulder width apart.

336
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,651
A little more, Yeah. Now lower your stance.

337
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:01,084
Follow me.

338
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,113
1

339
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:04,352
2

340
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,402
Put your foot forward.

341
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,785
3

342
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:09,103
Your right foot too.

343
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,425
3 You should hold the racquet

344
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:12,865
Like this...

345
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,932
And keep your hand like this.

346
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,657
3! Like so, to the right side.

347
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,211
Again.

348
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:23,493
Try it again.

349
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:28,258
Like this.

350
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,443
1

351
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:34,217
2, 3

352
00:24:34,217 --> 00:24:37,362
1, 2, 3

353
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:45,475
In every sport the fundamentals are important.

354
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:48,359
Every step should be at the same pace.

355
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:56,965
Keeping it steady.

356
00:24:56,965 --> 00:25:06,911
Come on. Hurry, hurry.

357
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:18,918
Hey!

358
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,946
Here.

359
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:22,762
Now harder.

360
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:28,005
Good.

361
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:43,979
Good.

362
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:47,846
She's really trying her best.

363
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,093
I mean Oh Ha Ni.

364
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:54,008
Even so, what can you do with only one week?!

365
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:56,802
Well, it's fun.

366
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:59,467
Oh Ha Ni has the joy of raising /teaching.

367
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:00,063
Joy of raising/ teaching?

368
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:07,376
She's amazing. It's like if she puts her mind into something and works hard, she can achieve it.

369
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:09,219
Certainly,

370
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:12,012
That's because you're good at everything without having to make an effort,

371
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:15,835
and having to work to death to accomplish something,

372
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,059
you don't know anything about it.

373
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,084
You're like that too.

374
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:56,082
You're right.

375
00:26:56,082 --> 00:27:02,804
Follow the ball until the end.

376
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:12,916
To the right, to the right.

377
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,839
Keep your eyes on it until the end.

378
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:19,024
No matter how hard I try I keep closing my eyes, so I can't see. What can I do?!

379
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:21,782
I said No! How many times do I need to tell you that.

380
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:23,012
Father,

381
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:24,266
Please think about it.

382
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:29,328
If they stay for 3 nights and 2 days, something's bound to happen, right?

383
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,179
If you let me have a break...

384
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:32,549
I can plan everything out.

385
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:33,554
Hey!

386
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:36,096
How long are you just going to chase her?

387
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:39,543
Don't just chase her.

388
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,937
Can't you make Ha Ni come to you?

389
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:44,839
You need to have respect.

390
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:47,347
Because you follow her around so crazily,

391
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:51,079
That's why she's not acknowledging you!

392
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:58,744
Hurry up and go finish what needs to be done in the kitchen.

393
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,208
HEY! Change that hairstyle of yours!

394
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:24,327
That-little- thing- That's not Ha Ni's style!

395
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,771
What am I really?

396
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:32,322
Even though my resolution was firm...

397
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:37,177
just thinking about spending 3 days and 2 nights with Baek Seung Jo...

398
00:28:37,177 --> 00:28:42,625
my heart is fluttering.

399
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,839
What to do?

400
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:55,297
This isn't right.

401
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:56,542
Ha Ni!

402
00:28:56,542 --> 00:29:00,882
Ah, Joon Gu. You came early.

403
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,394
Here, take this with you.

404
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:04,407
What is it?

405
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:07,897
It's a lunch box.

406
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:08,826
Joon Gu.

407
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:10,651
You have to remember,

408
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,616
I am your home.

409
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:13,098
Home?

410
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,012
Right.

411
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:18,717
A home that will always be there for you no matter what.

412
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:21,388
It's still there after you've partied so much, and even

413
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:23,524
after you've sobbed because things are so tough and then you come home.

414
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:27,704
The thing that always stays the same, your home.

415
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:31,953
Hurry up and go. Be sure to come back safely. Don't hurt yourself.

416
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:34,786
Thank you. I'll eat it well.

417
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:40,046
Right.

418
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,891
Joon Gu!

419
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:56,536
Thank you.

420
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:59,608
Aish! This really isn't my style.

421
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:02,065
It's really tough to earn respect.

422
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:08,547
Respect....

423
00:30:08,547 --> 00:30:14,026
Ah, Sunbaenim!

424
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,728
You rascals... look at the way you're dressed.

425
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:19,484
The MT of our tennis club...

426
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,109
is for us to reside on campus...

427
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:24,121
and undergo special training. It's a tradition.

428
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,682
Sunbaenim! That's ridiculous!

429
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:31,373
Be quiet.

430
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,741
Starting now, I'll give you 5 minutes

431
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:35,854
Go back and drop your stuff at the clubroom.

432
00:30:35,854 --> 00:30:37,279
And then meet here again.

433
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,337
Some people are not here yet,

434
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,102
Once everyone is here,

435
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,063
We'll do it.

436
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:43,702
What?

437
00:30:43,702 --> 00:30:45,321
Who hasn't showed up yet?

438
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:50,386
Baek Seung Jo,Yoon Hae Ra and Oh Ha Ni.

439
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:53,617
Fine. Baek Seung Jo and Yoon Hae Ra

440
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:56,102
Are special members so that's okay,

441
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:57,727
But Oh Ha NI?

442
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:04,552
What's with that punk?

443
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,156
Omo! Hello.

444
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:10,617
Yes.

445
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,317
It's a little idle right now.

446
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:16,417
Before the customers start coming for dinner...

447
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:26,117
Please take a seat.

448
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,622
Ah but...

449
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:35,852
People like Ha Ni always ride these. It was so cute to me.

450
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,622
So I bought one, but it doesn't fit in my car.

451
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:43,035
I just brought it here.

452
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:48,151
Tell Ha Ni to ride it.

453
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:51,015
I'm not sure if it's okay to keep receiving things.

454
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:55,055
If you don't take it, then it's not okay.

455
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:57,583
And...

456
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,095
Your mail...

457
00:31:58,095 --> 00:32:01,183
Ah thank you.

458
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:06,089
I haven't been able to change the address yet. I'm sorry.

459
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:08,617
Do you like it?

460
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:11,017
Just the two of you living together?

461
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:13,917
What?

462
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:14,417
Ah well.

463
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:18,453
I got a disease... depression.

464
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:21,035
It's pretty serious.

465
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:25,117
I heard from Soo Chang.

466
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:31,517
Before Ha Ni came, at our house, the person who talked and made mistakes...

467
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:34,083
I was the only one.

468
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:40,075
Seung Jo and Eun Jo... they don't have that type of personality. And my husband is busy.

469
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:45,055
If I don't laugh, our house turns into a depressing hole.

470
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:50,055
But when Ha Ni came, I liked it so much. It felt like I was living.

471
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:55,217
I was happy.

472
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:58,222
Would it be okay to live together again?

473
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:03,117
You haven't changed your address yet.

474
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:06,083
I thought about it a lot.

475
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,015
Maybe I'm being too selfish.

476
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:14,055
That I'll be the only one that's happy. She seemed like the perfect match for Seung Jo.

477
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:17,817
Maybe I'm being too greedy.

478
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:19,055
But...

479
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:23,683
I feel like Ha Ni will be sad alone too.

480
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:32,583
Actually I was waiting for that too. But now they're all in college, and if Seung Jo gets a new girlfriend...

481
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:37,483
Rather than having a hard time moving after getting close to everyone...

482
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:41,095
I thought it might be better to hurt a little bit right now.

483
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:50,015
To Ha Ni...

484
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:55,075
We'll start tomorrow at 6:00AM. In the morning we'll swing. In the afternoon we'll learn how to top spin.

485
00:33:55,075 --> 00:34:03,065
To the people who think we're going on the MT to have fun, it's a good idea to reset that mindset.

486
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:18,117
Here here here. It's time to rest. We'll all rest and after an hour, let's meet at the front court.

487
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:21,015
Good work.

488
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:25,817
Yah Han Ni ah.<BR><BR>Come here.

489
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:29,015
You don't need to come to the evening training.

490
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:30,283
Why?

491
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:33,075
You're in charge of the dinner now.

492
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:35,045
By myself?

493
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:42,917
You were tardy this morning. Think of it as a punishment and go make dinner. It's better off this way. You don't have to train.

494
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,483
Wait a second.

495
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,005
Then what about the match on the last day?

496
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:48,583
Oh that? Of course we have to do that, since I promised.

497
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:53,025
How can you put her in charge of the food? She needs to train more than the others.

498
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:56,483
That's your problem. She was tardy though.

499
00:34:56,483 --> 00:35:00,183
Are you not letting her practice because you think you might lose?

500
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,517
Sunbae (Senior)

501
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,065
You have that low of confidence?

502
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:12,383
Ah.. that...

503
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:13,617
Hurry up with the food.

504
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:16,583
So we can train with the time leftover. I told you...

505
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:27,317
The match after tomorrow, we have to win.

506
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:29,045
It'll probably be tiring... by yourself.

507
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:32,183
You're not saying that you'll help me.

508
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:36,183
I don't really like cooking.

509
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:38,065
I have something to say.

510
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:43,383
You might have already noticed, but I'm interested in Seung Jo.

511
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:47,045
So I'm going to tell Seung Jo this time.

512
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:50,583
It should be okay, right?

513
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,417
Why are you asking me?

514
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,117
I'm not sure.

515
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:59,483
I keep feeling like I'm taking candy from a baby.

516
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:00,075
What?

517
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,783
Ah, it's not that.

518
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:05,217
I'm fine.

519
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:07,483
Really?

520
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:09,005
I feel better then.

521
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:25,005
Then work hard.

522
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:28,683
There's no end to this peeling.

523
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,583
Ah hot.

524
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:31,817
Yah Oh Ha Ni

525
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:36,183
Do you still have a lot left? If you keep going slow like that, there won't be any time to practice.

526
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:38,317
Seung Jo ah.

527
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:41,283
Baek Seung Jo.

528
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,383
Help me.

529
00:36:43,383 --> 00:37:08,817
I need to hurry up and finish so I can practice.

530
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:10,083
Sesame oil.

531
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:17,317
Yes!

532
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:25,017
Yah Yah Yah!<BR><BR>Stop.

533
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:26,417
Ground red pepper.

534
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:33,817
Yes.

535
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,883
Put in a little bit.

536
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:46,017
I said just put in just a little.

537
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:50,065
Woah. It looks so good.

538
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:56,095
Who made this? It looks so good!

539
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,015
Please sit down.

540
00:37:58,015 --> 00:38:04,015
Ha Ni, did you do this? You're really great.

541
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,483
You can get married now. What is all this?

542
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:08,783
It looks so delicious Ha Ni.

543
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:11,483
Woah it's really good, it's really good! Try it, try it!

544
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,817
What is this?

545
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:15,075
This is quite good.

546
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:18,383
It's shrimp! So good!

547
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:21,883
Try this. It's really good.

548
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,183
Yah Baek Seung Jo.

549
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:27,783
What are you? Give her some compliments.

550
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:42,015
Seung Jo, he's very picky.

551
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,117
Oh Ha Ni.

552
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:48,683
Let's go practice.

553
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:51,817
I wonder if the kids are doing okay.

554
00:38:51,817 --> 00:38:56,025
It would be nice if they got closer so that she can come back.

555
00:38:56,025 --> 00:39:01,883
We spent all that time together. How can Seung Jo be so cold?

556
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:10,117
I didn't notice it when they were here. But since Ha Ni is gone, the house seems empty and no fun.

557
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,683
You think that way too, don't you?

558
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,075
Honey,

559
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:20,075
Can we ask Ki Dong shi to come live with us again?

560
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:25,017
Should I meet Ki Dong once then?

561
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:27,283
Honey, thank you so much.

562
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,683
Even if we live together again,

563
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:33,217
I'm not going to give up my room. Definitely not.

564
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:38,883
1, 2

565
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:39,383
3

566
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:44,482
1, 2

567
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,017
How many do you have left?

568
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,085
Keep your hips straight.

569
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,817
Keep your back straight

570
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,483
Keep your back straight

571
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:55,183
Keeps your hips straight. And your butt too.

572
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:57,015
Ah I can't do this.

573
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:58,075
Yah<BR><BR>Get up.

574
00:39:58,075 --> 00:40:01,217
Get up.

575
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:01,817
Yah!

576
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:02,045
Get up.

577
00:40:02,045 --> 00:40:13,095
Quickly.

578
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:15,383
I'm tired.

579
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:15,085
Mmh.

580
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,025
Tired is playing tennis.

581
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,617
Get up.

582
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:21,683
Swing.

583
00:40:21,683 --> 00:40:22,983
To the outside.

584
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:25,683
Back hand.

585
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:56,917
One more time.

586
00:40:56,917 --> 00:41:06,205
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

587
00:41:06,205 --> 00:42:34,515
What are you doing? Let's do it again.

588
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:49,086
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

589
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:53,388
Baek Seung Jo!

590
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:56,446
You missed the afternoon training yesterday.

591
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:59,815
Without catching up first, don't do anything else.

592
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:01,915
Will it be okay?

593
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:02,982
You'll probably regret.

594
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:03,448
What?

595
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:37,151
Then maybe I should go buy some ramen.

596
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:39,403
Ha Ni ah. What happened with this?

597
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:45,773
Even though it looks like that, the taste should be okay.

598
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:52,415
Really?

599
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:53,915
Jong Suk.

600
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:55,148
You eat one.

601
00:43:55,148 --> 00:43:56,482
Yes?

602
00:43:56,482 --> 00:44:07,982
Try one.

603
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:14,648
Where did the Dae Jang Geum from yesterday go?

604
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:16,782
I'm sorry.

605
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:21,417
-Actually, I didn't make it yesterday.-Then who made it?

606
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:26,315
You were the only one who missed the evening training.

607
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:29,257
Ah!Baek Seung Jo.

608
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:30,115
Huh?

609
00:44:30,115 --> 00:44:43,415
Seung Jo?

610
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:44,378
Good job!

611
00:44:44,378 --> 00:45:59,648
Doing a good job!

612
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:11,215
Ah, you came?

613
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:12,916
<i>What are you doing Oh Ha Ni...

614
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:27,015
<i>What are you going to do by following them?

615
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:35,682
<i>No, I'm not following them. I'm just getting fresh air.

616
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:41,982
What? Is there something you wanted to tell me?

617
00:46:41,982 --> 00:46:47,848
I don't know what to say..this isn't my usual style.

618
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:52,215
I was second when I entered the school

619
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:55,815
I also applied to lower school than the ones that I could go.

620
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,548
There were some circumstances.

621
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:06,682
Is that so?

622
00:47:06,682 --> 00:47:11,682
I like you.

623
00:47:11,682 --> 00:47:13,782
And you?

624
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:31,982
How do you feel?

625
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:38,882
Hey.

626
00:47:38,882 --> 00:47:40,015
What are you doing?

627
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:42,248
What are you doing? Watching them.

628
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:46,382
Possibly, do you like Hae Ra?

629
00:47:46,382 --> 00:48:01,748
Sh!

630
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:06,282
From the looks of it, this seems fun. However, I'm sorry but...

631
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:10,982
I'm going to borrow her since we have a match tomorrow.

632
00:48:10,982 --> 00:48:17,182
Huh? Oh okay take her.

633
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:21,995
You're doing good. In a position that can't even serve.

634
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:22,815
That's not it.

635
00:48:22,815 --> 00:49:00,815
Come! We're going to practice until you get it right.

636
00:49:00,815 --> 00:49:03,715
Should I change my hairstyle?

637
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:33,748
It's the coolest style in my neighborhood though.

638
00:49:33,748 --> 00:49:58,748
Oh Ha Ni is really working hard. Right?

639
00:49:58,748 --> 00:49:59,315
You're alright?

640
00:49:59,315 --> 00:50:08,582
Yes, I'm alright.

641
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:12,115
Good Job. You succeeded.

642
00:50:12,115 --> 00:50:15,981
The speed of your serve was pretty fast too.

643
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:17,581
It works if I do it like this?

644
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:21,381
Yeah... You did well.

645
00:50:21,381 --> 00:50:22,815
<i>He smiled.

646

Huh?

No.

653
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:54,415
You are hurt.

654
00:50:54,415 --> 00:51:01,015
Well, it isn't Oh Ha Ni to just fall (and not cause trouble).

655
00:51:01,015 --> 00:51:03,681
What is it?

656
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:07,548
We'll forfeit the doubles we were going to do later.

657
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:08,148
Huh?

658
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,681
Injury.

659
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:11,481
No, we have to do it.

660
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,081
How can you do it like this?

661
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:14,648
You can't even get up.

662
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:16,548
But still.

663
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:20,415
You said we have to win...

664
00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:22,648
I practiced really hard.

665
00:51:22,648 --> 00:51:25,948
With your feet?

666
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:30,615
It's fine. There's nothing we can do about it.

667
00:51:30,615 --> 00:51:32,284
I'm sorry...

668
00:51:32,284 --> 00:51:37,681
-Because of me...-I wasn't even counting on winning anyways.

669
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:50,281
Get on.

670
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:53,215
Hey! Baek Seung Jo!

671
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,115
You have to play the match you promised. How can you just go?

672
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:58,548
Do we have to do the game now?

673
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:44,463
Let's set up another one soon. Today, as you can see...

674
00:52:44,463 --> 00:52:47,463
Omo! You look so cool!

675
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:49,023
Huh? Woah.

676
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,263
Ah. Who are you?

677
00:52:52,263 --> 00:52:54,023
It's a little awkward.

678
00:52:54,023 --> 00:52:55,644
You look like a different person.

679
00:52:55,644 --> 00:52:56,897
Yeah totally! You should have done it sooner.

680
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:58,197
What happened to your hair?

681
00:52:58,197 --> 00:53:01,013
I cut it.

682
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:09,073
ohh

683
00:53:09,073 --> 00:53:16,263
Who is that? Is it Seung Jo?

684
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:19,073
What's going on?What's going on?She got hurt?

685
00:53:19,073 --> 00:53:20,563
Ha Ni!

686
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:23,003
Where? Where did you get hurt?

687
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:25,093
It seems she hurt her leg.

688
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:29,063
Sit down, sit down!

689
00:53:29,063 --> 00:53:32,192
While training, she twisted her ankle.

690
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,083
It also seems to be weaker because of the accident from before.

691
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,497
Looks like you're going to have to put it in a cast again.

692
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,463
Try using an ankle brace

693
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:42,997
It'll be a good idea to keep it on for 6 weeks.

694
00:53:42,997 --> 00:53:50,197
A half cast? Alright.

695
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:53,263
You look different.

696
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,997
What are you talking about, environment?

697
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:57,043
Can you say something like that right now?

698
00:53:57,043 --> 00:53:59,163
Bringing someone who was healthy home like this

699
00:53:59,163 --> 00:54:00,093
That's not it.

700
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:05,397
It was my fault that I got hurt. So don't say that.

701
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:07,797
That's right.

702
00:54:07,797 --> 00:54:11,563
I guess If you say so.

703
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:25,839
I get it. I'll keep my mouth shut.

704
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:32,563
Ha Ni really didn't say anything about you changing your style?

705
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:36,043
That's because she was with Baek Seung Jo.

706
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:40,863
You're so pitiful!

707
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:44,897
Though, your hair looks great!

708
00:54:44,897 --> 00:54:49,563
I think so too! You look like a totally different person. You should have done this sooner!

709
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:54,497
Hey, do you know? Ha Ni really likes this style.

710
00:54:54,497 --> 00:55:59,053
He said she didn't notice.

711
00:55:59,053 --> 00:56:02,073
Ha Ni. Here eat!

712
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:05,597
Eat this too. It's a boiled egg.

713
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:06,083
What about the other people?

714
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:08,897
It's okay.

715
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:10,023
Thank you Joon Gu. I'll eat well.

716
00:56:10,023 --> 00:56:37,797
Okay.

717
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:41,296
Ha Ni, I'm really doing my best.

718
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:56,163
Do you know?

719
00:56:56,163 --> 00:57:00,863
or from the movie Personal Taste you can sense...

720
00:57:00,863 --> 00:57:06,863
the first quote goes, "All things are not studio but location."

721
00:57:06,863 --> 00:57:09,097
We take it from a realistic perspective.

722
00:57:09,097 --> 00:57:20,897
So, location, sound, and art.

723
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:26,023
Without even knowing, I ended up coming here.

724
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:28,597
Since I already came,

725
00:57:28,597 --> 00:57:42,463
How about I catch a little look of his face?

726
00:57:42,463 --> 00:57:44,363
Seung Jo.

727
00:57:44,363 --> 00:57:46,033
How about we go see a movie today?

728
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:48,073
There is a movie I really want to see.

729
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:51,863
What do you think? After watching it we can go <u></u><u></u><u></u><u></u>.<u></u>

730
00:57:51,863 --> 00:58:12,797
Okay, sounds good, I've been wanting to get out anyway.

731
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:14,297
Popcorn and two sodas.

732
00:58:14,297 --> 00:58:16,697
It's 7000 won.

733
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:20,397
Let me pay.

734
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:24,297
<i>I dreamed about going on a date together since freshman year of high school.

735
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:28,563
<i>I would even have a fashion show the night before to pick out clothes to wear.

736
00:58:28,563 --> 00:58:33,497
<i>Watch a movie, and when it ends go window shopping together.

737
00:58:33,497 --> 00:58:37,763
<i>Then sit together at a coffee shop and chat.

738
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:48,534
<i> All of that he's doing with Yoon Hae Ra.

739
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:53,567
I'm sorry.

740
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,004
Ha Ni! What are you doing here?

741
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:59,000
Sunbae!

742
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,734
You... You!

743
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:08,434
Sunbae you too.

744
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:10,646
Ha Ni.

745
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:14,001
You like Seung Jo, right? I know.

746
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:18,334
And that's right, I like Hae Ra.

747
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:22,009
But Hae Ra likes Seung Jo. Don't you think that's wrong too?

748
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:26,734
That's why, you and I should collaborate.

749
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:28,271
Collaborate?

750
00:59:28,271 --> 00:59:33,967
First, since we don't really have anything planned... we'll follow them...

751
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:39,009
When we get a chance, or if it gets dangerous we can leave.

752
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:41,334
That's a little...

753
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:42,008
What's a little?

754
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:51,867
Then did we come out just to watch them have fun together?

755
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:57,134
Anyways, does Seung Jo... does he have fast hands?

756
00:59:57,134 --> 01:00:00,005
Huh? What are you talking about?

757
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:06,434
Ah touching. Skinship. This kind of stuff.

758
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:09,006
I'm not sure.

759
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:12,167
I don't think it's like that.

760
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:15,051
He doesn't like doing those...

761
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:18,084
Not interested...?

762
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:20,367
That's because it's you.

763
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:28,734
I don't think it'll be easy for Seung Jo to hold it in with someone as sexy as Hae Ra.

764
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:33,767
<i>I love you.

765
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:39,134
<i>I love you.

766
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:42,467
<i>This is me saying this.

767
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:46,367
<i>So...

768
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:51,009
<i>Like I said, these are my feelings.

769
01:00:51,009 --> 01:00:54,467
<i>It's not a dream or anything, but...

770
01:00:54,467 --> 01:01:16,967
<i>Please don't let anything happen in this dark place.

771
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:44,134
I heard those two were engaged in real life.

772
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:46,001
Aigoo.

773
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:55,467
Aigoo. I'm so sorry.

774
01:01:55,467 --> 01:02:21,000
You did well!

775
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,001
I'm sorry.

776
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:23,867
That brat... where is he puttng that hand?

777
01:02:23,867 --> 01:02:24,667
Thanks.

778
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:35,567
-Ah really.-Thanks.

779
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:38,067
<i>What am I doing?

780
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:43,002
<i>Sneaking around on someone else's date, planning to intrude.

781
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:46,006
<i>I just got to see them get along in the end.

782
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:51,667
Ha Ni, they're going that way. Let's go quickly.

783
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:57,009
What is it?

784
01:02:57,009 --> 01:03:01,334
I'm thinking about stopping.

785
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:04,334
What are you talking about?

786
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:06,967
I can't watch anymore.

787
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,006
It's too difficult.

788
01:03:08,006 --> 01:03:11,006
Ah, what's wrong all of a sudden?

789
01:03:11,006 --> 01:03:16,007
We have to go, what if they make a move?

790
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:25,003
If they like each other, there's nothing we can do.

791
01:03:25,003 --> 01:03:31,234
I've realized that now.

792
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:39,000
Then, are you saying that you're going to acknowledge them doing that?

793
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:49,834
I don't wan't to be made a fool of anymore.

794
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:51,967
Aish!

795
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:54,434
I'm so sorry!

796
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:56,004
How am I supposed to get rid of it?

797
01:03:56,004 --> 01:03:59,767
I have to go meet my girlfriend right now!

798
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:01,867
Do you know how much this is?

799
01:04:01,867 --> 01:04:03,534
I'll give you the money for dry cleaning.

800
01:04:03,534 --> 01:04:06,003
Yes, the money for dry cleaning.

801
01:04:06,003 --> 01:04:07,334
Dry cleaning money?

802
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:16,034
Yes. How much...?

803
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:20,234
Ah, she's my hoobae. I'll give it to you.

804
01:04:20,234 --> 01:04:22,434
Right here. 10,000 won.($10)

805
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:24,004
Are you playing around right now?

806
01:04:24,004 --> 01:04:26,634
Huh?

807
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:32,167
100,000 won ($100)?

808
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:34,004
Oh. Why are you being like this?

809
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,005
You're playing around with me right now, aren't you?

810
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,002
Huh?

811
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,867
This is worth 2,000,000 won ($2000)!

812
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:42,234
Then you should at least pay half.

813
01:04:42,234 --> 01:04:45,367
1,000,000 won ($1000)?

814
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:47,667
Sir!

815
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:53,967
I'm only 21. Where do I have that kind of money? Please forgive us.

816
01:04:53,967 --> 01:04:58,734
Do you want to get beat up or do you want to quietly figure it out here?

817
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:02,008
Ah please let this go and talk. Why are you being like this?

818
01:05:02,008 --> 01:05:05,001
Ha Ni!

819
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:11,067
Are you okay?

820
01:05:11,067 --> 01:05:19,063
Boss. What's going on here?

821
01:05:19,063 --> 01:05:33,763
Seung Jo. Do you have 1,000,000 won? You're from a rich family.

822
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,033
Sunbae! Yes?

823
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:40,497
I will, you know...

824
01:05:40,497 --> 01:05:47,023
Ah! One, two, three.

825
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:50,363
-Hurry!-Get them!

826
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:55,197
Get them!!

827
01:05:55,197 --> 01:06:09,044

829
01:06:23,863 --> 01:06:31,497
Let's move, Ha Ni.

830
01:06:31,497 --> 01:06:47,763
Bye, Baek Seung Jo.

831
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:50,463
I forgot Seung Jo.

832
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:56,463
Baek Seung Jo has nothing to do with me anymore.

833
01:06:56,463 --> 01:06:58,963
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

834
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:03,013
I like you.

835
01:07:03,013 --> 99:59:59,999
You?

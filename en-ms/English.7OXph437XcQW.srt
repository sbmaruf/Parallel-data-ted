1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,730
Determine whether 394 is greater
than or less than 397.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,220
Then write the expression that
shows this using either this

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,020
symbol or that symbol,
and this is actually

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,570
the less than symbol.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,480
We'll think a little bit more
about how to remember that.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,000
That is the less than symbol
and this is the

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,690
greater than symbol.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,270
So first of all, let's
just look at the two

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,290
numbers: 394 and 397.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,009
So let me write them down.

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:45,820
394 and the other
number is 397.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,480
Now, they both have 3 hundreds,
so their hundreds

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,650
place is equivalent.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,880
They both have 90 with that 9
there, but this is 300 plus 90

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,200
plus 4 and this is 300
plus 90 plus 7.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,025
And we know that 4
is less than 7.

18
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,830
If you look on a number line,
4 comes before 7.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,850
If you're counting the 7, you're
going to pass up 4, so

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,610
394 is less than 397.

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,630
And the way that we write that,
we would just write 394

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,860
is less than 397.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,740
And the way I remember that this
means less than is that

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,230
the smaller number is on the
side that has kind of a

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,070
smaller side.

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,870
You can imagine this side
is much smaller than

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,480
this side over here.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,800
We could also write
it the other way.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,050
We could write 397 is
greater than 394.

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,390
And once again, the bigger
number is the side that this

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,630
little thing is opening onto
or the side that has the

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,440
bigger side of this
symbol right here.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,520
This point is the
smaller side.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,060
This out here is the
bigger side.

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,380
That's where you put
the larger number.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,050
Greater than, less than.

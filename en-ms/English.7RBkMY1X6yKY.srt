1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,574

2
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:01,990
What I want to do
in this video is

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,771
see if we can identify similar
triangles here and prove

4
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,520
to ourselves that they
really are similar,

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,080
using some of the postulates
that we've set up.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,930
So over here, I
have triangle BDC.

7
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,870
It's inside of triangle AEC.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,010
They both share this
angle right over there,

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,140
so that gives us one angle.

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,020
We need two to get
to angle-angle,

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,980
which gives us similarity.

12
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,990
And we know that these
two lines are parallel.

13
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,365
We know if two
lines are parallel

14
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,770
and we have a transversal
that corresponding angles are

15
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,290
going to be congruent.

16
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,980
So that angle is
going to correspond

17
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,790
to that angle right over there.

18
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,880
And we're done.

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,180
We have one angle
in triangle AEC that

20
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,940
is congruent to
another angle in BDC,

21
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,760
and then we have
this angle that's

22
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,360
obviously congruent to itself
that's in both triangles.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,270
So both triangles have a
pair of corresponding angles

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,320
that are congruent, so
they must be similar.

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,050
So we can write,
triangle ACE is going

26
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,590
to be similar to
triangle-- and we

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,490
want to get the letters
in the right order.

28
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,030
So where the blue angle is
here, the blue angle there

29
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,100
is vertex B. Then we go
to the wide angle, C,

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,250
and then we go to the unlabeled
angle right over there, BCD.

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,667
So we did that first one.

32
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,250
Now let's do this
one right over here.

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,210
This is kind of
similar, but it looks,

34
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,030
just superficially looking at
it, that YZ is definitely not

35
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,380
parallel to ST. So we
won't be able to do

36
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,970
this corresponding
angle argument,

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,360
especially because they didn't
even label it as parallel.

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,871
And so you don't want to look
at things just by the way

39
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:29,370
they look.

40
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,770
You definitely want to
say, what am I given,

41
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,760
and what am I not given?

42
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
If these weren't
labeled parallel,

43
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,830
we wouldn't be able
to make the statement,

44
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,390
even if they looked parallel.

45
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,920
One thing we do have is that
we have this angle right here

46
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,820
that's common to
the inner triangle

47
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,000
and to the outer
triangle, and they've

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,770
given us a bunch of sides.

49
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,520
So maybe we can use
SAS for similarity,

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,250
meaning if we can show
the ratio of the sides

51
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,260
on either side of
this angle, if they

52
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,210
have the same ratio from the
smaller triangle to the larger

53
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,950
triangle, then we
can show similarity.

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,670
So let's go, and we have to go
on either side of this angle

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,360
right over here.

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,960
Let's look at the shorter side
on either side of this angle.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,373
So the shorter side
is two, and let's look

58
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:10,789
at the shorter
side on either side

59
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,880
of the angle for
the larger triangle.

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,190
Well, then the shorter side
is on the right-hand side,

61
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,496
and that's going to be XT.

62
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,120
So what we want to
compare is the ratio

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,810
between-- let me
write it this way.

64
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,500
We want to see, is XY
over XT equal to the ratio

65
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,370
of the longer side?

66
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,770
Or if we're looking relative
to this angle, the longer

67
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,540
of the two, not necessarily
the longest of the triangle,

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,040
although it looks
like that as well.

69
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,792
Is that equal to the ratio of
XZ over the longer of the two

70
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,750
sides-- when you're
looking at this angle right

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,208
here, on either
side of that angle,

72
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,746
for the larger
triangle-- over XS?

73
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,764

74
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:54,180
And it's a little confusing,
because we've kind of flipped

75
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,400
which side, but I'm just
thinking about the shorter

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,340
side on either side of
this angle in between,

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,899
and then the longer side on
either side of this angle.

78
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:04,190
So these are the shorter
sides for the smaller triangle

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,430
and the larger triangle.

80
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,740
These are the longer sides
for the smaller triangle

81
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,240
and the larger triangle.

82
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,610
And we see XY.

83
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,870
This is two.

84
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,400
XT is 3 plus 1 is 4.

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,160
XZ is 3, and XS is 6.

86
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,810
So you have 2 over
4, which is 1/2,

87
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,080
which is the same thing as 3/6.

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,090
So the ratio between
the shorter sides

89
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,160
on either side of the
angle and the longer

90
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,300
sides on either side of the
angle, for both triangles,

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,590
the ratio is the same.

92
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,437
So by SAS we know that the
two triangles are congruent.

93
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,770
But we have to be careful on
how we state the triangles.

94
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,264
We want to make sure we get
the corresponding sides.

95
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,680
And I'm running
out of space here.

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Let me write it
right above here.

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:04,250
We can write that triangle
XYZ is similar to triangle--

98
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,380
so we started up at X, which
is the vertex at the angle,

99
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,560
and we went to the
shorter side first.

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,370
So now we want to
start at X and go

101
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,430
to the shorter side
on the large triangle.

102
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,404
So you go to XTS.

103
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:19,899

104
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,454
XYZ is similar to XTS.

105
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:25,120
Now, let's look at
this right over here.

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,860
So in our larger triangle,
we have a right angle here,

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,980
but we really know
nothing about what's

108
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,930
going on with any of
these smaller triangles

109
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,390
in terms of their actual angles.

110
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,140
Even though this looks
like a right angle,

111
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,540
we cannot assume it.

112
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,090
And if we look at this smaller
triangle right over here,

113
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,130
it shares one side with
the larger triangle,

114
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,770
but that's not enough
to do anything.

115
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,710
And then this triangle over
here also shares another side,

116
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,221
but that also
doesn't do anything.

117
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,970
So we really can't
make any statement here

118
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,590
about any kind of similarity.

119
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,280
So there's no similarity
going on here.

120
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,500

121
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,300
There are some shared angles.

122
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,723
This guy-- they both share
that angle, the larger triangle

123
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:02,690
and the smaller triangle.

124
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,110
So there could be a
statement of similarity

125
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,260
we could make if we knew
that this definitely

126
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,360
was a right angle.

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,276
Then we could make some
interesting statements

128
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,740
about similarity,
but right now, we

129
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,130
can't really do anything as is.

130
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,214
Let's try this one out,
this pair right over here.

131
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:18,255
So these are the first
ones that we have actually

132
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:19,610
separated out the triangles.

133
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,910
So they've given us the three
sides of both triangles.

134
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,590
So let's just figure
out if the ratios

135
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,460
between corresponding
sides are a constant.

136
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,580
So let's start with
the short side.

137
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,370
So the short side here is 3.

138
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,960
The shortest side here
is 9 square roots of 3.

139
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,340
So we want to see whether the
ratio of 3 to 9 square roots

140
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,220
of 3 is equal to the next
longest side over here,

141
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,170
is 3 square roots of 3 over the
next longest side over here,

142
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,845
which is 27.

143
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:53,030

144
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,820
And then see if
that's going to be

145
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,240
equal to the ratio
of the longest side.

146
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,590
So the longest side
here is 6, and then

147
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,390
the longest side over here
is 18 square roots of 3.

148
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,070

149
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,220
So this is going to give
us-- let's see, this is 3.

150
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,050
Let me do this in
a neutral color.

151
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,140
So this becomes 1 over
3 square roots of 3.

152
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:26,541
This becomes 1
over root 3 over 9,

153
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,040
which seems like a
different number,

154
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,180
but we want to be careful here.

155
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,690
And then this right over here--
if you divide the numerator

156
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,170
and denominator
by 6, this becomes

157
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,580
a 1 and this becomes
3 square roots of 3.

158
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:46,940
So 1 over 3 root 3 needs to
be equal to square root of 3

159
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,020
over 9, which needs to be equal
to 1 over 3 square roots of 3.

160
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,220
At first they don't look
equal, but we can actually

161
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,290
rationalize this
denominator right over here.

162
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,130
We can show that 1 over
3 square roots of 3,

163
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,150
if you multiply it
by square root of 3

164
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,250
over square root
of 3, this actually

165
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,750
gives you in the
numerator square root of 3

166
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,140
over square root of 3 times
square root of 3 is 3, times 3

167
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,280
is 9.

168
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,190
So these actually
are all the same.

169
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,082
This is actually
saying, this is 1 over 3

170
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,540
root 3, which is the same thing
as square root of 3 over 9,

171
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,039
which is this right
over here, which

172
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,230
is the same thing
as 1 over 3 root 3.

173
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,120
So actually, these
are similar triangles.

174
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,760
So we can actually
say it, and I'll

175
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,360
make sure I get the order right.

176
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,600
So let's start with E,
which is between the blue

177
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,010
and the magenta side.

178
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,780
So that's between the
blue and the magenta side.

179
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,010
That is H, right over here.

180
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,690

181
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,500
I'll do it like this.

182
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:50,830
Triangle E, and then I'll
go along the blue side, F.

183
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,720
Actually, let me just
write it this way.

184
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,340
Triangle EFG, we know
is similar to triangle--

185
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,780
So E is between the blue
and the magenta side.

186
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,180
Blue and magenta side--
that is H. And then we

187
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,470
go along the blue side to F,
go along the blue side to I,

188
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,660
and then you went along
the orange side to G,

189
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,110
and then you go along
the orange side to J.

190
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,070
So triangle EFJ-- EFG is
similar to triangle HIJ

191
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,570
by side-side-side similarity.

192
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,030
They're not congruent sides.

193
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,700
They all have just the same
ratio or the same scaling

194
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,910
factor.

195
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,755
Now let's do this last
one, right over here.

196
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:30,120

197
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,620
Let's see.

198
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,309
We have an angle that's
congruent to another angle

199
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,490
right over there, and
we have two sides.

200
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,870
And so it might be tempting
to use side-angle-side,

201
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,210
because we have
side-angle-side here.

202
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,204
And even the ratios look kind
of tempting, because 4 times 2

203
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:44,703
is 8.

204
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,460
5 times 2 is 10.

205
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,720
But it's tricky
here, because they

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,315
aren't the same
corresponding sides.

207
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,440
In order to use side-angle-side,
the two sides that

208
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,740
have the same
corresponding ratios,

209
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,820
they have to be on
either side of the angle.

210
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,090
So in this case, they are
on either side of the angle.

211
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,250
In this case, the 4 is
on one side of the angle,

212
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,190
but the 5 is not.

213
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,430
So because if this
5 was over here,

214
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,605
then we could make an
argument for similarity,

215
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:12,230
but with this 5 not being on the
other side of the angle-- it's

216
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,140
not sandwiching the
angle with the 4--

217
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,680
we can't use side-angle-side.

218
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,800
And frankly, there's nothing
that we can do over here.

219
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,790
So we can't make
some strong statement

220
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,760
about similarity
for this last one.

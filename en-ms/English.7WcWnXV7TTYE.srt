1
00:00:01,118 --> 00:00:03,440
I think we're all reasonably
familiar with the three states

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,400
of matter in our
everyday world.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,680
At very high temperatures
you get a fourth.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,990
But the three ones that we
normally deal with are, things

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:22,920
could be a solid, a liquid,
or it could be a gas.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,960
And we have this general notion,
and I think water is

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,050
the example that always comes
to at least my mind.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,740
Is that solid happens
when things are

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,720
colder, relatively colder.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,540
And then as you warm up, you
go into a liquid state.

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,390
And as your warm up even more
you go into a gaseous state.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,480
So you go from colder
to hotter.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,360
And in the case of water, when
you're a solid, you're ice.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,490
When you're a liquid, some
people would call ice water,

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,490
but let's call it
liquid water.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,370
I think we know what that is.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,910
And then when it's in the gas
state, you're essentially

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,160
vapor or steam.

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,810
So let's think a little bit
about what, at least in the

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,500
case of water, and the analogy
will extend to

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,040
other types of molecules.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,180
But what is it about water that
makes it solid, and when

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,600
it's colder, what allows
it to be liquid.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,570
And I'll be frank, liquids are
kind of fascinating because

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,940
you can never nail them
down, I guess is the

26
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,890
best way to view them.

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,400
Or a gas.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,670
So let's just draw
a water molecule.

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,750
So you have oxygen there.

30
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,020
You have some bonds
to hydrogen.

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,370
And then you have two extra
pairs of valence electrons in

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,320
the oxygen.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,290
And a couple of videos ago, we
said oxygen is a lot more

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,060
electronegative than
the hydrogen.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,330
It likes to hog the electrons.

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,430
So even though this shows
that they're sharing

37
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,300
electrons here and here.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,840
At both sides of those lines,
you can kind of view that

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,720
hydrogen is contributing an
electron and oxygen is

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,020
contributing an electron on
both sides of that line.

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,650
But we know because of the
electronegativity, or the

42
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,700
relative electronegativity of
oxygen, that it's hogging

43
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,750
these electrons.

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,310
And so the electrons spend a
lot more time around the

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,610
oxygen than they do around
the hydrogen.

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,880
And what that results is that
on the oxygen side of the

47
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,190
molecule, you end up with a
partial negative charge.

48
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,540
And we talked about
that a little bit.

49
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,880
And on the hydrogen side of the
molecules, you end up with

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,475
a slightly positive charge.

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:51,460
Now, if these molecules have
very little kinetic energy,

52
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,860
they're not moving around a
whole lot, then the positive

53
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,910
sides of the hydrogens are very
attracted to the negative

54
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,430
sides of oxygen in
other molecules.

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,970
Let me draw some
more molecules.

56
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,980
When we talk about the whole
state of the whole matter, we

57
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,080
actually think about how the
molecules are interacting with

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,480
each other.

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Not just how the atoms are
interacting with each other

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,050
within a molecule.

61
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,490
I just drew one oxygen, let
me copy and paste that.

62
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,390
But I could do multiple
oxygens.

63
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,820
And let's say that that hydrogen
is going to want to

64
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,310
be near this oxygen.

65
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,410
Because this has partial
negative charge, this has a

66
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,670
partial positive charge.

67
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,190
And then I could do another
one right there.

68
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,930
And then maybe we'll have, and
just to make the point clear,

69
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,110
you have two hydrogens
here, maybe an oxygen

70
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,500
wants to hang out there.

71
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,410
So maybe you have an oxygen that
wants to be here because

72
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,710
it's got its partial
negative here.

73
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,970
And it's connected to two
hydrogens right there that

74
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,590
have their partial positives.

75
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,990
But you can kind of see
a lattice structure.

76
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,510
Let me draw these bonds, these
polar bonds that start forming

77
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,420
between the particles.

78
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,620
These bonds, they're called
polar bonds because the

79
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,000
molecules themselves
are polar.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,459
And you can see it forms
this lattice structure.

81
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,649
And if each of these molecules
don't have a

82
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,010
lot of kinetic energy.

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,590
Or we could say the average
kinetic energy of this matter

84
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,500
is fairly low.

85
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,040
And what do we know is average
kinetic energy?

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,520
Well, that's temperature.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,840
Then this lattice structure
will be solid.

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,800
These molecules will not move
relative to each other.

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,070
I could draw a gazillion more,
but I think you get the point

90
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,480
that we're forming this kind
of fixed structure.

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,100
And while we're in the solid
state, as we add kinetic

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,040
energy, as we add heat, what
it does to molecules is, it

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,860
just makes them vibrate
around a little bit.

94
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,967
If I was a cartoonist, they way
you'd draw a vibration is

95
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,320
to put quotation marks there.

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,190
That's not very scientific.

97
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,700
But they would vibrate around,
they would buzz around a

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,300
little bit.

99
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm drawing arrows to show
that they are vibrating.

100
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,300
It doesn't have to be just

101
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,810
left-right it could be up-down.

102
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,170
But as you add more and more
heat in a solid, these

103
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,650
molecules are going to
keep their structure.

104
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,640
So they're not going to move
around relative to each other.

105
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,210
But they will convert that heat,
and heat is just a form

106
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,130
of energy, into kinetic energy
which is expressed as the

107
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,340
vibration of these molecules.

108
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,020
Now, if you make these molecules
start to vibrate

109
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,560
enough, and if you put enough
kinetic energy into these

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,450
molecules, what do you think
is going to happen?

111
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,830
Well this guy is vibrating
pretty hard, and he's

112
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,340
vibrating harder and harder as
you add more and more heat.

113
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,670
This guy is doing
the same thing.

114
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,910
At some point, these polar bonds
that they have to each

115
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,800
other are going to start not
being strong enough to contain

116
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,780
the vibrations.

117
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,040
And once that happens, the
molecules-- let me draw a

118
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,880
couple more.

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,570
Once that happens, the molecules
are going to start

120
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,970
moving past each other.

121
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,765
So now all of a sudden, the
molecule will start shifting.

122
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,970
But they're still attracted.

123
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,140
Maybe this side is moving here,
that's moving there.

124
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,540
You have other molecules
moving around that way.

125
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,120
But they're still attracted
to each other.

126
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,450
Even though we've gotten the
kinetic energy to the point

127
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:31,320
that the vibrations can kind of
break the bonds between the

128
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,480
polar sides of the molecules.

129
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,260
Our vibration, or our kinetic
energy for each molecule,

130
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,550
still isn't strong enough to
completely separate them.

131
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,000
They're starting to slide
past each other.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,840
And this is essentially what
happens when you're in a

133
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,260
liquid state.

134
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,760
You have a lot of atoms that
want be touching each other

135
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,750
but they're sliding.

136
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,050
They have enough kinetic energy
to slide past each

137
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,480
other and break that solid
lattice structure here.

138
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,270
And then if you add even more
kinetic energy, even more

139
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,290
heat, at this point it's
a solution now.

140
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,010
They're not even going to be
able to stay together.

141
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,970
They're not going to be able
to stay near each other.

142
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,260
If you add enough kinetic energy
they're going to start

143
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,080
looking like this.

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,130
They're going to completely
separate and then kind of

145
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,330
bounce around independently.

146
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,210
Especially independently if
they're an ideal gas.

147
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,560
But in general, in gases,
they're no longer touching

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,980
each other.

149
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,150
They might bump into
each other.

150
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,060
But they have so much kinetic
energy on their own that

151
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,430
they're all doing
their own thing

152
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,300
and they're not touching.

153
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,650
I think that makes intuitive
sense if you just think about

154
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,070
what a gas is.

155
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,700
For example, it's hard
to see a gas.

156
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,420
Why is it hard to see a gas?

157
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,660
Because the molecules are
much further apart.

158
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,670
So they're not acting on the
light in the way that a liquid

159
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,310
or a solid would.

160
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,390
And if we keep making that
extended further, a solid--

161
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,010
well, I probably shouldn't
use the example with ice.

162
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,800
Because ice or water is one of
the few situations where the

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
solid is less dense
than the liquid.

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,440
That's why ice floats.

165
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,960
And that's why icebergs don't
just all fall to the

166
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,710
bottom of the ocean.

167
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,090
And ponds don't completely
freeze solid.

168
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,870
But you can imagine that,
because a liquid is in most

169
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,380
cases other than water,
less dense.

170
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,130
That's another reason why you
can see through it a little

171
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,830
bit better.

172
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,940
Or it's not diffracting-- well I
won't go into that too much,

173
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,040
than maybe even a solid.

174
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,950
But the gas is the
most obvious.

175
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,920
And it is true with water.

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,700
The liquid form is definitely
more dense than the gas form.

177
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,830
In the gas form, the molecules
are going to jump around, not

178
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,830
touch each other.

179
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,130
And because of that,
more light can

180
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,030
get through the substance.

181
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,309
Now the question is, how do we
measure the amount of heat

182
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,940
that it takes to do
this to water?

183
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,800
And to explain that, I'll
actually draw a

184
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,990
phase change diagram.

185
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,670
Which is a fancy way of
describing something fairly

186
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,710
straightforward.

187
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,400
Let me say that this is the
amount of heat I'm adding.

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
And this is the temperature.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,390
We'll talk about the states
of matter in a second.

190
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,490
So heat is often denoted by q.

191
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,080
Sometimes people will talk
about change in heat.

192
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,680
They'll use H, lowercase
and uppercase H.

193
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,450
They'll put a delta
in front of the H.

194
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,430
Delta just means change in.

195
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,980
And sometimes you'll hear
the word enthalpy.

196
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,740
Let me write that.

197
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,250
Because I used to say
what is enthalpy?

198
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,050
It sounds like empathy,
but it's

199
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,600
quite a different concept.

200
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,280
At least, as far as my neural
connections could make it.

201
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,810
But enthalpy is closely
related to heat.

202
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,060
It's heat content.

203
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,250
For our purposes, when you hear
someone say change in

204
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,550
enthalpy, you should really
just be thinking

205
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,690
of change in heat.

206
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,850
I think this word was really
just introduced to confuse

207
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,860
chemistry students and introduce
a non-intuitive word

208
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,080
into their vocabulary.

209
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,100
The best way to think about
it is heat content.

210
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,130
Change in enthalpy is really
just change in heat.

211
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,230
And just remember, all of these
things, whether we're

212
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,000
talking about heat,
kinetic energy,

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,410
potential energy, enthalpy.

214
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,590
You'll hear them in different
contexts, and you're like, I

215
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,550
thought I should be using
heat and they're

216
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,030
talking about enthalpy.

217
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,300
These are all forms of energy.

218
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,040
And these are all measured
in joules.

219
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,100
And they might be measured
in other ways, but the

220
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,550
traditional way is in joules.

221
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,800
And energy is the ability
to do work.

222
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,720
And what's the unit for work?

223
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,450
Well, it's joules.

224
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,470
Force times distance.

225
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,040
But anyway, that's
a side-note.

226
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,590
But it's good to know
this word enthalpy.

227
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,820
Especially in a chemistry
context, because it's used all

228
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,170
the time and it can be very
confusing and non-intuitive.

229
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,830
Because you're like, I don't
know what enthalpy is in my

230
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,460
everyday life.

231
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,170
Just think of it as heat
contact, because that's really

232
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:50,910
what it is.

233
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,430
But anyway, on this
axis, I have heat.

234
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,180
So this is when I have very
little heat and I'm

235
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,550
increasing my heat.

236
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,405
And this is temperature.

237
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,720
Now let's say at low
temperatures I'm here and as I

238
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,410
add heat my temperature
will go up.

239
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,190
Temperature is average
kinetic energy.

240
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,380
Let's say I'm in the
solid state here.

241
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,460
And I'll do the solid
state in purple.

242
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,590
No I already was using purple.

243
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,490
I'll use magenta.

244
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,810
So as I add heat, my temperature
will go up.

245
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,040
Heat is a form of energy.

246
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,070
And when I add it to these
molecules, as I did in this

247
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,070
example, what did it do?

248
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,620
It made them vibrate more.

249
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,290
Or it made them have higher
kinetic energy, or higher

250
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,830
average kinetic engery, and
that's what temperature is a

251
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,860
measure of; average
kinetic energy.

252
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,430
So as I add heat in the solid
phase, my average kinetic

253
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,650
energy will go up.

254
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,710
And let me write this down.

255
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:58,930
This is in the solid phase, or
the solid state of matter.

256
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,060
Now something very interesting
happens.

257
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,930
Let's say this is water.

258
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:09,920
So what happens at
zero degrees?

259
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,910
Which is also 273.15 Kelvin.

260
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,830
Let's say that's that line.

261
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,320
What happens to a solid?

262
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,550
Well, it turns into a liquid.

263
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,600
Ice melts.

264
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,960
Not all solids, we're talking
in particular about

265
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,540
water, about H2O.

266
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,990
So this is ice in our example.

267
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,670
All solids aren't ice.

268
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,950
Although, you could think of
a rock as solid magma.

269
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,200
Because that's what it is.

270
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,150
I could take that analogy a
bunch of different ways.

271
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,365
But the interesting thing that
happens at zero degrees.

272
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,120
Depending on what direction
you're going, either the

273
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,730
freezing point of water or
the melting point of ice,

274
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,550
something interesting happens.

275
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,840
As I add more heat, the
temperature does not to go up.

276
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,440
As I add more heat, the
temperature does not go up for

277
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
a little period.

278
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,150
Let me draw that.

279
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,460
For a little period, the
temperature stays constant.

280
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,970
And then while the temperature
is constant, it stays a solid.

281
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,090
We're still a solid.

282
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,580
And then, we finally
turn into a liquid.

283
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,960
Let's say right there.

284
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,525
So we added a certain amount
of heat and it

285
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,590
just stayed a solid.

286
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,180
But it got us to the
point that the ice

287
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,220
turned into a liquid.

288
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,090
It was kind of melting
the entire time.

289
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,690
That's the best way
to think about it.

290
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,190
And then, once we keep adding
more and more heat, then the

291
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,440
liquid warms up too.

292
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,650
Now, we get to, what
temperature becomes

293
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,770
interesting again for water?

294
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:56,700
Well, obviously 100 degrees
Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.

295
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,940
I'll do it in Celsius
because that's what

296
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,230
we're familiar with.

297
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,960
What happens?

298
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,890
That's the temperature at which
water will vaporize or

299
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,510
which water will boil.

300
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,040
But something happens.

301
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,300
And they're really getting
kinetically active.

302
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,510
But just like when you went from
solid to liquid, there's

303
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,990
a certain amount of energy that
you have to contribute to

304
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,330
the system.

305
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,140
And actually, it's a good
amount at this point.

306
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,360
Where the water is turning
into vapor, but it's not

307
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,610
getting any hotter.

308
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,280
So we have to keep adding heat,
but notice that the

309
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,230
temperature didn't go up.

310
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,070
We'll talk about it
in a second what

311
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,120
was happening then.

312
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,060
And then finally, after that
point, we're completely

313
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,070
vaporized, or we're
completely steam.

314
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,890
Then we can start getting hot,
the steam can then get hotter

315
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,170
as we add more and more
heat to the system.

316
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,770
So the interesting question, I
think it's intuitive, that as

317
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:01,540
you add heat here, our
temperature is going to go up.

318
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,820
But the interesting thing is,
what was going on here?

319
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,880
We were adding heat.

320
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,810
So over here we were turning our
heat into kinetic energy.

321
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,090
Temperature is average
kinetic energy.

322
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,710
But over here, what was
our heat doing?

323
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,080
Well, our heat was was
not adding kinetic

324
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,130
energy to the system.

325
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,900
The temperature was
not increasing.

326
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,980
But the ice was going
from ice to water.

327
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,110
So what was happening at that
state, is that the kinetic

328
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,220
energy, the heat, was being
used to essentially break

329
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,190
these bonds.

330
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,080
And essentially bring
the molecules into a

331
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,660
higher energy state.

332
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,840
So you're saying, Sal,
what does that mean,

333
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,640
higher energy state?

334
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,270
Well, if there wasn't all of
this heat and all this kinetic

335
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,910
energy, these molecules
want to be very

336
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,810
close to each other.

337
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,230
For example, I want
to be close to the

338
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,590
surface of the earth.

339
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,610
When you put me in a plane
you have put me in a

340
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,850
higher energy state.

341
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,000
I have a lot more potential
energy.

342
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,800
I have the potential to fall
towards the earth.

343
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,630
Likewise, when you move these
molecules apart, and you go

344
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,570
from a solid to a liquid,
they want to fall

345
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,900
towards each other.

346
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,850
But because they have so much
kinetic energy, they never

347
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,280
quite are able to do it.

348
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,420
But their energy goes up.

349
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,700
Their potential energy is higher
because they want to

350
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,960
fall towards each other.

351
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,800
By falling towards each
other, in theory, they

352
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,010
could do some work.

353
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,720
So what's happening here is,
when we're contributing heat--

354
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,530
and this amount of heat we're
contributing, it's called the

355
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,780
heat of fusion.

356
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,010
Because it's the same amount
of heat regardless how much

357
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,240
direction we go in.

358
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,350
When we go from solid to liquid,
you view it as the

359
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,450
heat of melting.

360
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,040
It's the head that you need
to put in to melt

361
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
the ice into liquid.

362
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,530
When you're going in this
direction, it's the heat you

363
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,800
have to take out of the
zero degree water to

364
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,040
turn it into ice.

365
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,160
So you're taking that potential
energy and you're

366
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,050
bringing the molecules closer
and closer to each other.

367
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,700
So the way to think about it
is, right here this heat is

368
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,530
being converted to
kinetic energy.

369
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,020
Then, when we're at this phase
change from solid to liquid,

370
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,980
that heat is being used
to add potential

371
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,050
energy into the system.

372
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,369
To pull the molecules
apart, to give them

373
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,420
more potential energy.

374
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,060
If you pull me apart from the
earth, you're giving me

375
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,000
potential energy.

376
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,040
Because gravity wants to pull
me back to the earth.

377
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,640
And I could do work when I'm
falling back to the earth.

378
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,770
A waterfall does work.

379
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,210
It can move a turbine.

380
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,625
You could have a bunch
of falling Sals move

381
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,160
a turbine as well.

382
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,050
And then, once you are fully a
liquid, then you just become a

383
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,440
warmer and warmer liquid.

384
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,760
Now the heat is, once again,
being used for kinetic energy.

385
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,010
You're making the water
molecules move past each other

386
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,190
faster, and faster,
and faster.

387
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,630
To some point where they want
to completely disassociate

388
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,580
from each other.

389
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,370
They want to not even slide
past each other, just

390
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,080
completely jump away
from each other.

391
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,140
And that's right here.

392
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,610
This is the heat of
vaporization.

393
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,440
And the same idea
is happening.

394
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,710
Before we were sliding next to
each other, now we're pulling

395
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,510
apart altogether.

396
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,620
So they could definitely
fall closer together.

397
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,510
And then once we've added this
much heat, now we're just

398
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,650
heating up the steam.

399
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,990
We're just heating up
the gaseous water.

400
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,770
And it's just getting hotter
and hotter and hotter.

401
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,670
But the interesting thing there,
and I mean at least the

402
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,040
interesting thing to me when I
first learned this, whenever I

403
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,970
think of zero degrees water I'll
say, oh it must be ice.

404
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,590
But that's not necessarily
the case.

405
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,680
If you start with water and you
make it colder and colder

406
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,460
and colder to zero degrees,
you're essentially taking heat

407
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,440
out of the water.

408
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,410
You can have zero degree
water and it hasn't

409
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,660
turned into ice yet.

410
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,850
And likewise, you could have 100
degree water that hasn't

411
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,070
turned into steam yeat.

412
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,200
You have to add more energy.

413
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
You can also have 100
degree steam.

414
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,700
You can also have zero
degree water.

415
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,680
Anyway, hopefully that gives you
a little bit of intuition

416
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,740
of what the different states
of matter are.

417
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,180
And in the next problem, we'll
talk about how much heat

418
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,130
exactly it does take to
move along this line.

419
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,020
And maybe we can solve some
problems on how much ice we

420
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,620
might need to make
our drink cool.

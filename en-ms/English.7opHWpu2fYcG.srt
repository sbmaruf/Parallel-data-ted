1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, if President Obama

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
then I would have a suggestion for him

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that I think would vastly improve

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the mathematics education in this country.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And it would be easy to implement

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and inexpensive.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The mathematics curriculum that we have

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And everything we learn after that

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is building up towards one subject.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And I'm here to say

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
every high school graduate should know --

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
should be statistics:

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
probability and statistics.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
(Applause)

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's one of the great products of the human mind.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
they should definitely learn calculus

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
by the end of their freshman year of college.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that very few people actually use calculus

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
On the other hand,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and should, use on  daily basis. Right?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's understanding data.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think if our students, if our high school students --

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
if all of the American citizens --

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
knew about probability and statistics,

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean, probability and statistics,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's analyzing trends.  It's predicting the future.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Look, the world has changed

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
from analog to digital.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
from analog to digital,

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the mathematics of uncertainty,

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
of randomness, of data --

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that being probability and statistics.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In summary, instead of our students

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
learning about the techniques of calculus,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think it would be far more significant

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
if all of them knew what two standard deviations

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
from the mean means. And I mean it.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you very much.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
(Applause)

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,780
We're asked to
solve the equation

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,550
2x squared plus
3 is equal to 75.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,190
So in this situation,
it looks like we

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,890
might be able to isolate
the x squared pretty simply.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,150
Because there's only one
term that involves an x here.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,950
It's only this x squared term.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,277
So let's try to do that.

9
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:19,360
So let me just rewrite it.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,250
We have 2x squared
plus 3 is equal to 75.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,610
And we're going to try to
isolate this x squared over

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:26,820
here.

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,153
And the best way to do that,
or at least the first step,

14
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:32,960
would be to subtract 3 from
both sides of this equation.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,270
So let's subtract
3 from both sides.

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,580
The left hand side, we're
just left with 2x squared.

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,690
That was the whole point of
subtracting 3 from both sides.

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,260
And on the right hand
side, 75 minus 3 is 72.

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,070
Now, I want to isolate
this x squared.

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,780
I have a 2x squared here.

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,610
So I could have just
an x squared here

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,265
if I divide this side or
really both sides by 2.

23
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:56,640
Anything I do to one side, I
have to do to the other side

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,370
if I want to maintain
the equality.

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,820
So the left side, just
becomes x squared.

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,540
And the right hand side
is 72 divided by 2 is 36.

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,290
So we're left with x
squared is equal to 36.

28
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,280
And then to solve for x,
we can take the positive,

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
the plus or minus square
root of both sides.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,190
So we could say the plus or--
let me write it this way--

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,430
If we take the square
root of both sides,

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,230
we would get x is equal to
the plus or minus square root

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,316
of 36, which is equal
to plus or minus 6.

34
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,940
Let me just write
that on another line.

35
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,010
So x is equal to
plus or minus 6.

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,877
And remember here, if something
squared is equal to 36,

37
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:42,710
that something could
be the negative version

38
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,900
or the positive version.

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,400
It could be the
principal root or it

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,940
could be the negative root.

41
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,390
Both negative 6 squared is
36 and positive 6 squared

42
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,910
is 36, so both of these work.

43
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,160
And you could put them back
into the original equation

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,370
to verify it.

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,070
Let's do that.

46
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,210
If you say 2 times
6 squared plus 3,

47
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,040
that's 2 times 36, which
is 72 plus 3 is 75.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,647
So that works.

49
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,230
If you put negative
6 in there, you're

50
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,688
going to get the
exact same result.

51
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:11,720
Because negative 6
squared is also 36.

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,820
2 times 36 is 72 plus 3 is 75.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,507

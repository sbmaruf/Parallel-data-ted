00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,830
Welcome to the presentation on multiplying decimals.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,230
Let's get started.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,587
So I think you'll find out that multiplying decimals

4
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:13,210
is not a lot more difficult than just multiplying regular numbers.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,122
And I'll show you in a problem.

6
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:16,940
Lets say, let me pick some random numbers.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:25,580
Let's say I had seven thousand five hundred eighteen.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,580
Actually, let's make that's seventy-five point one eight.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,680
Clearly you can tell I'm doing this on the fly.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:39,538
Seventy-five point one eight times zero point nine seven.

11
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,915
So first you look at this problem  and you're like, oh boy that's tough.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,100
These decimals-- I don't even know how to approach it.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,480
Well this is what you do.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,729
You ignore the decimals when you start the problem

15
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,630
and you pretend like it's just a regular multiplication problem.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,861
And if you ignore the decimals, it would be like I said at the beginning,

17
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:57,280
seven thousand five hundred eighteen on top and ninety-seven on the bottom.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,450
And if that doesn't make sense let me just show you.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,722
I'm just going to ignore the decimals

20
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,310
and do this like a normal multiplication problem.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,460
So normal multiplication.

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,870
I'd start at the ones place right here.

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,430
I'd say seven times eight.

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,520
Well, seven times eight is fifty-six.

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,790
Carry the five.

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,880
Seven times one is seven.

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,010
Plus the five is twelve.

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,470
Two down here.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,290
Carry the one.

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,720
Seven times five is thirty-five.

31
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,810
Plus the one is thirty-six.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,790
Put the six here.

33
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,960
Carry the three.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,810
And then seven times seven is forty-nine.

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,690
Plus three is fifty-two.

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,370
So just put fifty-two here.

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,827
So just like normal multiplication

38
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:42,866
we just took the ones place right here, the seven.

39
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:43,858
So it's actually not the ones,

40
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:45,505
but we're ignoring the decimals

41
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,020
so if there were no decimals this would be the ones place.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,070
And we're multiplying it by the top number.

43
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,020
Seven times seven thousand five hundred eighteen is equal to fifty-two thousand six hundred twenty-six.

44
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,138
And just like regular multiplication, we do the tens place.

45
00:01:58,138 --> 00:01:59,696
And this isn't really the tens place,

46
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,020
but if you ignore the decimals it would be.

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,120
And let's cross all this stuff out since we're not using it.

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,870
Nine times eight is seventy-two.

49
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,110
Carry the seven.

50
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,250
Nine times one is nine.

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,430
Plus seven is sixteen.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,950
Carry the one.

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,860
Nine times five is forty-five.

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,097
This is good practice for me, too.

55
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:24,360
I haven't done my multiplication tables in a long time.

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,310
Nine times five is forty-five.

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,580
Plus one is forty-six.

58
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,560
Carry the four.

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,060
Nine times seven is sixty-three.

60
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,592
Plus four is sixty-seven.

61
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,760
Now we add.

62
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,395
So you're probably thinking, boy, what do decimals have to do with this at all?

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,020
I'm just doing a regular multiplication problem.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,520
And I'll show you.

65
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,370
Actually the decimals only come in right at the very end.

66
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,786
So what I do is now I just add like I do a regular level four multiplication problem.

67
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,870
So I say six plus zero is six.

68
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,870
Two plus two is four.

69
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,430
Six plus six is twelve.

70
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,150
Carry the one.

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,620
One plus two plus six is nine.

72
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,980
Five plus seven is twelve.

73
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,250
Carry the one.

74
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,360
One plus six is seven.

75
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,960
Okay, so now here's where the decimals come into play.

76
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,700
And your I think you're going to be shocked by how straightforward this is.

77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,370
What I do is I go back to the original problem

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,420
and now I actually pay attention to the decimals.

79
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,627
And I say, how many total numbers are behind the decimal point?

80
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,519
Well, there's one number behind the decimal point,

81
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,722
two numbers behind the decimal point,

82
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:37,788
three numbers behind the decimal point,

83
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:40,040
four numbers behind the decimal point.

84
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,740
One, two, three, four.

85
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,352
So there are four numbers behind the decimal point in the problem I did, and I just count here.

86
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:49,800
One, two, three, four.

87
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,515
The answer will also have four numbers behind the decimal point,

88
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:54,610
and that's the answer.

89
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,180
Seventy-two point nine two four six.

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,740
Now let me ask you a question.

91
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,162
If I had a zero here,

92
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:11,169
would that count as an extra number behind the decimal point?

93
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,534
Well, it only would have been

94
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:17,210
if you actually used the zero in the multiplication.

95
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,750
Maybe that confuses you.

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,897
What I would recommend,

97
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:22,685
if you have any trailing zeros with a decimal like this,

98
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,672
you should actually just ignore those zeros,

99
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,736
and then do the problem just the way I did it.

100
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:31,130
And remember, that's only for trailing zeros.

101
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,250
If this was the bottom number then that zero would matter

102
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,268
because it's not a trailing zero, its actually part of the number.

103
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:44,060
Let's do a couple more examples and I think that'll make sense.

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,374
So let's say I had five--

105
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:49,590
and I'm going to do a simpler example arithmetically.

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,060
I think it'll help you with some principles.

107
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:00,870
If I said five point one zero times one point zero nine.

108
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,000
So there's two things we could do.

109
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,550
We could just multiply it the way it is.

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,553
Actually let's do it both ways.

111
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:10,386
And I'll show you that you get the same answer whether or not you ignore that zero.

112
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:14,450
So in the first case let's not ignore the zero.

113
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,153
Let's use that zero, even though that trailing zero in the decimal--

114
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:19,615
five point one zero is the same thing as five point one.

115
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,740
But let's use it.

116
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,680
Nine times zero is zero.

117
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,990
Nine times one is nine.

118
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,560
Nine times five is forty-five.

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,195
And in the zeros place you put a zero

120
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,593
and then zero times everything is zero.  Right?

121
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:36,770
Zero times zero, zero times one, zero times five.

122
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,730
Put two zeros here.

123
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,180
And then one times zero is zero.

124
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,860
One times one is one.

125
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,540
And one times five is five.

126
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,420
And now we add it all.

127
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,740
We get zero, nine, five, five, five.

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,430
And like we did before, we just count the decimals.

129
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,640
One, two, three, four.

130
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,440
So one, two, three, four.

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,720
So the decimal will go here.

132
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,470
So we got five point five five nine zero as the answer.

133
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,576
Now what if we did like I was recommending, we actually ignored the zero?

134
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:15,514
So I say, And I can actually rewrite it as one point zero nine times five point one.

135
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:17,511
Because you know in multiplication order doesn't matter.

136
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,930
a times b is the same thing as b times a.

137
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,990
Two times three is the same thing as three times two.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,680
So one point zero nine times five point one is the same thing as five point one times one point zero nine.

139
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,310
So let's just multiply this out.

140
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,570
And notice, these are the same numbers.

141
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,330
All I did is I took the zero off.

142
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,890
So, first I just ignore the decimals. I say one times nine is nine.

143
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,100
One times zero is zero.

144
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,544
One times one is one.

145
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:44,900
Put a zero here.

146
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,230
Five times nine is forty-five.

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,720
Carry the four.

148
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,060
Five time zero is zero.

149
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,050
Plus four is four.

150
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,410
Five times one is five.

151
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,820
Now I add.

152
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,280
Nine, five, five, five.

153
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,788
Now I'm at the point

154
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,030
that I can actually pay attention to the decimal points.

155
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,880
How many numbers are behind the decimals?

156
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, there's one, two, three.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,310
So I go one, two, three, and put the decimal point right here.

158
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,500
Notice I got the same exact answer.

159
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,600
The only difference is that this one had a trailing zero,

160
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,620
which really doesn't make a number any different.

161
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,775
I could add a hundred zeros here

162
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:30,480
and the number's really not a different number.

163
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,094
If you were a computer programmer

164
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,240
or a statistician of some kind, this could be an important number.

165
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,510
But ignore what I just said.

166
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:44,328
But for your purposes, these trailing zeros mean nothing.

167
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,590
Same way a leading zero actually would mean nothing.

168
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,382
No one ever does that.

169
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,836
Let me do-- well, let me see how much time I have.

170
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:52,460
I have two more minutes.

171
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,510
Let me do one more problem just to maybe hit the point home.

172
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:03,791
You know, this is really no different than level four multiplication.

173
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,615
And at the end you just have to count the numbers behind the decimal point.

174
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:11,040
So five times five is twenty-five.

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,165
Whoops. Twenty-five.

176
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:14,570
I'm already getting messy.

177
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,900
Carry the two.

178
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,020
Fve times seven is thirty-five.

179
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,860
Plus two is thirty-seven.

180
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,370
Bring down the seven, carry the three.

181
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,690
Five times zero is zero.

182
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,840
Plus three.

183
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,330
So it's three hundred and seventy-five, ignore that blob.

184
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,470
I'm sorry for being so messy.

185
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,000
And then you put a zero.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,610
One times five is five.

187
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,870
One times seven is seven.

188
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,260
Ignore that.

189
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,679
Now we add.

190
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,500
We say five plus zero is five.

191
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,410
Seven plus five is twelve.

192
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,040
One plus three plus seven is eleven.

193
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,756
So we got our answer,

194
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:49,820
now we just have to count the decimals.

195
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,733
So here we have one, two, three, four,

196
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,860
five numbers behind the decimal point.

197
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,946
But in our answer we only have four digits,

198
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,600
so how can we get five numbers behind the decimal point?

199
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,090
Well, we start here.

200
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,251
We say one, two, three, four,

201
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,360
and we need one more number behind the decimal point,

202
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,843
so we add a zero here.

203
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,080
And then we put the decimal point.

204
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,370
See what I just did?

205
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,010
We had to have five numbers behind the decimal point.

206
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,070
And we only had four numbers in the answer.

207
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,950
So I added a leading zero and then put the decimal point.

208
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,990
And now we have five numbers behind the decimal point.

209
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,380
And I've shown you a very mechanical way of doing this.

210
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,010
Hopefully in the future I can give you a seminar on actually

211
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,054
why this method of counting the numbers behind the decimal points actually works.

212
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,899
But I think you are ready to try some problems on multiplying decimals.

213
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:43,380
Have fun!

CHAPTER XVII
The Freeman's Defence

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,190
There was a gentle bustle at the Quaker
house, as the afternoon drew to a close.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,640
Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro,
collecting from her household stores such

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,239
needments as could be arranged in the
smallest compass, for the wanderers who

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,970
were to go forth that night.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,450
The afternoon shadows stretched eastward,
and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,570
the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and
calm into the little bed-room where George

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,520
and his wife were sitting.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,160
He was sitting with his child on his knee,
and his wife's hand in his.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,280
Both looked thoughtful and serious and
traces of tears were on their cheeks.

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,510
"Yes, Eliza," said George, "I know all you
say is true.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,079
You are a good child,--a great deal better
than I am; and I will try to do as you say.

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,329
I'll try to act worthy of a free man.

14
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,720
I'll try to feel like a Christian.

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,429
God Almighty knows that I've meant to do
well,--tried hard to do well,--when

16
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:16,330
everything has been against me; and now
I'll forget all the past, and put away

17
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:21,439
every hard and bitter feeling, and read my
Bible, and learn to be a good man."

18
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,100
"And when we get to Canada," said Eliza, "I
can help you.

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,560
I can do dress-making very well; and I
understand fine washing and ironing; and

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,600
between us we can find something to live
on."

21
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,810
"Yes, Eliza, so long as we have each other
and our boy.

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,100
O! Eliza, if these people only knew what a
blessing it is for a man to feel that his

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,259
wife and child belong to him!

24
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,299
I've often wondered to see men that could
call their wives and children their own

25
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:57,209
fretting and worrying about anything else.
Why, I feel rich and strong, though we have

26
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,420
nothing but our bare hands.

27
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,849
I feel as if I could scarcely ask God for
any more.

28
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:08,479
Yes, though I've worked hard every day,
till I am twenty-five years old, and have

29
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,950
not a cent of money, nor a roof to cover
me, nor a spot of land to call my own, yet,

30
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,790
if they will only let me alone now, I will

31
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,620
be satisfied,--thankful; I will work, and
send back the money for you and my boy.

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,000
As to my old master, he has been paid five
times over for all he ever spent for me.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,019
I don't owe him anything."

34
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:38,379
"But yet we are not quite out of danger,"
said Eliza; "we are not yet in Canada."

35
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:43,370
"True," said George, "but it seems as if I
smelt the free air, and it makes me

36
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,519
strong."

37
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,709
At this moment, voices were heard in the
outer apartment, in earnest conversation,

38
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,920
and very soon a rap was heard on the door.
Eliza started and opened it.

39
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,780
Simeon Halliday was there, and with him a
Quaker brother, whom he introduced as

40
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,910
Phineas Fletcher.

41
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,000
Phineas was tall and lathy, red-haired,
with an expression of great acuteness and

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,910
shrewdness in his face.

43
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:10,680
He had not the placid, quiet, unworldly air
of Simeon Halliday; on the contrary, a

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,180
particularly wide-awake and au fait
appearance, like a man who rather prides

45
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,420
himself on knowing what he is about, and

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,140
keeping a bright lookout ahead;
peculiarities which sorted rather oddly

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,919
with his broad brim and formal phraseology.

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,459
"Our friend Phineas hath discovered
something of importance to the interests of

49
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,079
thee and thy party, George," said Simeon;
"it were well for thee to hear it."

50
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,939
"That I have," said Phineas, "and it shows
the use of a man's always sleeping with one

51
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,040
ear open, in certain places, as I've always
said.

52
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,180
Last night I stopped at a little lone
tavern, back on the road.

53
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,450
Thee remembers the place, Simeon, where we
sold some apples, last year, to that fat

54
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,719
woman, with the great ear-rings.

55
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:01,349
Well, I was tired with hard driving; and,
after my supper I stretched myself down on

56
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,989
a pile of bags in the corner, and pulled a
buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was

57
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,499
ready; and what does I do, but get fast
asleep."

58
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,510
"With one ear open, Phineas?" said Simeon,
quietly.

59
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,049
"No; I slept, ears and all, for an hour or
two, for I was pretty well tired; but when

60
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,380
I came to myself a little, I found that
there were some men in the room, sitting

61
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,060
round a table, drinking and talking; and I

62
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,770
thought, before I made much muster, I'd
just see what they were up to, especially

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,040
as I heard them say something about the
Quakers.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,010
'So,' says one, 'they are up in the Quaker
settlement, no doubt,' says he.

65
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,660
Then I listened with both ears, and I found
that they were talking about this very

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,810
party.

67
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,910
So I lay and heard them lay off all their
plans.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,000
This young man, they said, was to be sent
back to Kentucky, to his master, who was

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,030
going to make an example of him, to keep
all niggers from running away; and his wife

70
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,570
two of them were going to run down to New

71
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,110
Orleans to sell, on their own account, and
they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen

72
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,760
hundred dollars for her; and the child,
they said, was going to a trader, who had

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,580
bought him; and then there was the boy,

74
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,650
Jim, and his mother, they were to go back
to their masters in Kentucky.

75
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,490
They said that there were two constables,
in a town a little piece ahead, who would

76
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,150
go in with 'em to get 'em taken up, and the
young woman was to be taken before a judge;

77
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,580
and one of the fellows, who is small and

78
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,800
smooth-spoken, was to swear to her for his
property, and get her delivered over to him

79
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,780
to take south.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,590
They've got a right notion of the track we
are going tonight; and they'll be down

81
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,400
after us, six or eight strong.
So now, what's to be done?"

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,120
The group that stood in various attitudes,
after this communication, were worthy of a

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,770
painter.

84
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,490
Rachel Halliday, who had taken her hands
out of a batch of biscuit, to hear the

85
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,860
news, stood with them upraised and floury,
and with a face of the deepest concern.

86
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,470
Simeon looked profoundly thoughtful; Eliza
had thrown her arms around her husband, and

87
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,590
was looking up to him.

88
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,110
George stood with clenched hands and
glowing eyes, and looking as any other man

89
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,130
might look, whose wife was to be sold at
auction, and son sent to a trader, all

90
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,400
under the shelter of a Christian nation's
laws.

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,980
"What shall we do, George?" said Eliza
faintly.

92
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,240
"I know what I shall do," said George, as
he stepped into the little room, and began

93
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,170
examining pistols.

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:41,120
"Ay, ay," said Phineas, nodding his head to
Simeon; "thou seest, Simeon, how it will

95
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,930
work."
"I see," said Simeon, sighing; "I pray it

96
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,160
come not to that."

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,840
"I don't want to involve any one with or
for me," said George.

98
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,380
"If you will lend me your vehicle and
direct me, I will drive alone to the next

99
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,370
stand.

100
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,680
Jim is a giant in strength, and brave as
death and despair, and so am I."

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,100
"Ah, well, friend," said Phineas, "but
thee'll need a driver, for all that.

102
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,550
Thee's quite welcome to do all the
fighting, thee knows; but I know a thing or

103
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,720
two about the road, that thee doesn't."
"But I don't want to involve you," said

104
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,970
George.

105
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,090
"Involve," said Phineas, with a curious and
keen expression of face, "When thee does

106
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,970
involve me, please to let me know."
"Phineas is a wise and skilful man," said

107
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,390
Simeon.

108
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,440
"Thee does well, George, to abide by his
judgment; and," he added, laying his hand

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,340
kindly on George's shoulder, and pointing
to the pistols, "be not over hasty with

110
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,190
these,--young blood is hot."

111
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,920
"I will attack no man," said George.

112
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,410
"All I ask of this country is to be let
alone, and I will go out peaceably; but,"--

113
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,350
he paused, and his brow darkened and his
face worked,--"I've had a sister sold in

114
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,880
that New Orleans market.

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,800
I know what they are sold for; and am I
going to stand by and see them take my wife

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,970
and sell her, when God has given me a pair
of strong arms to defend her?

117
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,220
No; God help me!

118
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,030
I'll fight to the last breath, before they
shall take my wife and son.

119
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,010
Can you blame me?"
"Mortal man cannot blame thee, George.

120
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,150
Flesh and blood could not do otherwise,"
said Simeon.

121
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,740
"Woe unto the world because of offences,
but woe unto them through whom the offence

122
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,120
cometh."

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,860
"Would not even you, sir, do the same, in
my place?"

124
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,210
"I pray that I be not tried," said Simeon;
"the flesh is weak."

125
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,860
"I think my flesh would be pretty tolerable
strong, in such a case," said Phineas,

126
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,570
stretching out a pair of arms like the
sails of a windmill.

127
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,710
"I an't sure, friend George, that I
shouldn't hold a fellow for thee, if thee

128
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,650
had any accounts to settle with him."

129
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,840
"If man should ever resist evil," said
Simeon, "then George should feel free to do

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,690
it now: but the leaders of our people
taught a more excellent way; for the wrath

131
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,930
of man worketh not the righteousness of

132
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,990
God; but it goes sorely against the corrupt
will of man, and none can receive it save

133
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,980
they to whom it is given.
Let us pray the Lord that we be not

134
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,820
tempted."

135
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,860
"And so I do," said Phineas; "but if we are
tempted too much--why, let them look out,

136
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,730
that's all."
"It's quite plain thee wasn't born a

137
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,620
Friend," said Simeon, smiling.

138
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,740
"The old nature hath its way in thee pretty
strong as yet."

139
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,960
To tell the truth, Phineas had been a
hearty, two-fisted backwoodsman, a vigorous

140
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,360
hunter, and a dead shot at a buck; but,
having wooed a pretty Quakeress, had been

141
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,630
moved by the power of her charms to join

142
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,280
the society in his neighborhood; and though
he was an honest, sober, and efficient

143
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,020
member, and nothing particular could be
alleged against him, yet the more spiritual

144
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,870
among them could not but discern an

145
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,550
exceeding lack of savor in his
developments.

146
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,750
"Friend Phineas will ever have ways of his
own," said Rachel Halliday, smiling; "but

147
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,579
we all think that his heart is in the right
place, after all."

148
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,630
"Well," said George, "isn't it best that we
hasten our flight?"

149
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,800
"I got up at four o'clock, and came on with
all speed, full two or three hours ahead of

150
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,990
them, if they start at the time they
planned.

151
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,340
It isn't safe to start till dark, at any
rate; for there are some evil persons in

152
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,150
the villages ahead, that might be disposed
to meddle with us, if they saw our wagon,

153
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,940
and that would delay us more than the

154
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,800
waiting; but in two hours I think we may
venture.

155
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,920
I will go over to Michael Cross, and engage
him to come behind on his swift nag, and

156
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,880
keep a bright lookout on the road, and warn
us if any company of men come on.

157
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,360
Michael keeps a horse that can soon get
ahead of most other horses; and he could

158
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,250
shoot ahead and let us know, if there were
any danger.

159
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,980
I am going out now to warn Jim and the old
woman to be in readiness, and to see about

160
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,560
the horse.

161
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,610
We have a pretty fair start, and stand a
good chance to get to the stand before they

162
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,720
can come up with us.

163
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,050
So, have good courage, friend George; this
isn't the first ugly scrape that I've been

164
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,779
in with thy people," said Phineas, as he
closed the door.

165
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,060
"Phineas is pretty shrewd," said Simeon.

166
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,310
"He will do the best that can be done for
thee, George."

167
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,699
"All I am sorry for," said George, "is the
risk to you."

168
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,720
"Thee'll much oblige us, friend George, to
say no more about that.

169
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,860
What we do we are conscience bound to do;
we can do no other way.

170
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,220
And now, mother," said he, turning to
Rachel, "hurry thy preparations for these

171
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,130
friends, for we must not send them away
fasting."

172
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,570
And while Rachel and her children were busy
making corn-cake, and cooking ham and

173
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,690
chicken, and hurrying on the et ceteras of
the evening meal, George and his wife sat

174
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,440
in their little room, with their arms

175
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,320
folded about each other, in such talk as
husband and wife have when they know that a

176
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
few hours may part them forever.

177
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,190
"Eliza," said George, "people that have
friends, and houses, and lands, and money,

178
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,600
and all those things can't love as we do,
who have nothing but each other.

179
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,500
Till I knew you, Eliza, no creature had
loved me, but my poor, heart-broken mother

180
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,620
and sister.
I saw poor Emily that morning the trader

181
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,980
carried her off.

182
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,300
She came to the corner where I was lying
asleep, and said, 'Poor George, your last

183
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,190
friend is going.
What will become of you, poor boy?'

184
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,680
And I got up and threw my arms round her,
and cried and sobbed, and she cried too;

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,019
and those were the last kind words I got
for ten long years; and my heart all

186
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,050
withered up, and felt as dry as ashes, till
I met you.

187
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,140
And your loving me,--why, it was almost
like raising one from the dead!

188
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,550
I've been a new man ever since!

189
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:07,680
And now, Eliza, I'll give my last drop of
blood, but they shall not take you from me.

190
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,290
Whoever gets you must walk over my dead
body."

191
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,330
"O, Lord, have mercy!" said Eliza, sobbing.

192
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:21,430
"If he will only let us get out of this
country together, that is all we ask."

193
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,240
"Is God on their side?" said George,
speaking less to his wife than pouring out

194
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,100
his own bitter thoughts.

195
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,170
"Does he see all they do?
Why does he let such things happen?

196
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,650
And they tell us that the Bible is on their
side; certainly all the power is.

197
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,940
They are rich, and healthy, and happy; they
are members of churches, expecting to go to

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,610
heaven; and they get along so easy in the
world, and have it all their own way; and

199
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,460
poor, honest, faithful Christians,--

200
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,020
Christians as good or better than they,--
are lying in the very dust under their

201
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,520
feet.

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,110
They buy 'em and sell 'em, and make trade
of their heart's blood, and groans and

203
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,860
tears,--and God lets them."

204
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,240
"Friend George," said Simeon, from the
kitchen, "listen to this Psalm; it may do

205
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,800
thee good."

206
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,350
George drew his seat near the door, and
Eliza, wiping her tears, came forward also

207
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:23,750
to listen, while Simeon read as follows:
"But as for me, my feet were almost gone;

208
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,899
my steps had well-nigh slipped.

209
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:31,120
For I was envious of the foolish, when I
saw the prosperity of the wicked.

210
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,930
They are not in trouble like other men,
neither are they plagued like other men.

211
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:43,020
Therefore, pride compasseth them as a
chain; violence covereth them as a garment.

212
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,399
Their eyes stand out with fatness; they
have more than heart could wish.

213
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,850
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly
concerning oppression; they speak loftily.

214
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,050
Therefore his people return, and the waters
of a full cup are wrung out to them, and

215
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,880
they say, How doth God know? and is there
knowledge in the Most High?"

216
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,279
"Is not that the way thee feels, George?"

217
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,390
"It is so indeed," said George,--"as well
as I could have written it myself."

218
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,120
"Then, hear," said Simeon: "When I thought
to know this, it was too painful for me

219
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,010
until I went unto the sanctuary of God.

220
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,520
Then understood I their end.
Surely thou didst set them in slippery

221
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,860
places, thou castedst them down to
destruction.

222
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,850
As a dream when one awaketh, so, oh Lord,
when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their

223
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,410
image.
Nevertheless I am continually with thee;

224
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,149
thou hast holden me by my right hand.

225
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:48,580
Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and
afterwards receive me to glory.

226
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,450
It is good for me to draw near unto God.
I have put my trust in the Lord God."

227
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:02,310
(NOTE: Ps. 73, "The End of the Wicked
contrasted with that of the Righteous.")

228
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,560
The words of holy trust, breathed by the
friendly old man, stole like sacred music

229
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,940
over the harassed and chafed spirit of
George; and after he ceased, he sat with a

230
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,870
gentle and subdued expression on his fine
features.

231
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,300
"If this world were all, George," said
Simeon, "thee might, indeed, ask where is

232
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,160
the Lord?

233
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,300
But it is often those who have least of all
in this life whom he chooseth for the

234
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,899
kingdom.

235
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:34,120
Put thy trust in him and, no matter what
befalls thee here, he will make all right

236
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,960
hereafter."

237
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,670
If these words had been spoken by some
easy, self-indulgent exhorter, from whose

238
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,490
mouth they might have come merely as pious
and rhetorical flourish, proper to be used

239
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,029
to people in distress, perhaps they might

240
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:53,640
not have had much effect; but coming from
one who daily and calmly risked fine and

241
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,290
imprisonment for the cause of God and man,
they had a weight that could not but be

242
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,230
felt, and both the poor, desolate fugitives

243
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,459
found calmness and strength breathing into
them from it.

244
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,779
And now Rachel took Eliza's hand kindly,
and led the way to the supper-table.

245
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:15,850
As they were sitting down, a light tap
sounded at the door, and Ruth entered.

246
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,730
"I just ran in," she said, "with these
little stockings for the boy,--three pair,

247
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,529
nice, warm woollen ones.

248
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:25,220
It will be so cold, thee knows, in Canada.

249
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:30,309
Does thee keep up good courage, Eliza?" she
added, tripping round to Eliza's side of

250
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,970
the table, and shaking her warmly by the
hand, and slipping a seed-cake into Harry's

251
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,860
hand.

252
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,129
"I brought a little parcel of these for
him," she said, tugging at her pocket to

253
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:42,799
get out the package.
"Children, thee knows, will always be

254
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,619
eating."

255
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,720
"O, thank you; you are too kind," said
Eliza.

256
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,009
"Come, Ruth, sit down to supper," said
Rachel.

257
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,419
"I couldn't, any way.

258
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,440
I left John with the baby, and some
biscuits in the oven; and I can't stay a

259
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,249
moment, else John will burn up all the
biscuits, and give the baby all the sugar

260
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:02,179
in the bowl.

261
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,600
That's the way he does," said the little
Quakeress, laughing.

262
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:11,879
"So, good-by, Eliza; good-by, George; the
Lord grant thee a safe journey;" and, with

263
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:15,360
a few tripping steps, Ruth was out of the
apartment.

264
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,080
A little while after supper, a large
covered-wagon drew up before the door; the

265
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,580
night was clear starlight; and Phineas
jumped briskly down from his seat to

266
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,570
arrange his passengers.

267
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,499
George walked out of the door, with his
child on one arm and his wife on the other.

268
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:35,149
His step was firm, his face settled and
resolute.

269
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,269
Rachel and Simeon came out after them.

270
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:42,739
"You get out, a moment," said Phineas to
those inside, "and let me fix the back of

271
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,450
the wagon, there, for the women-folks and
the boy."

272
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,269
"Here are the two buffaloes," said Rachel.

273
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,730
"Make the seats as comfortable as may be;
it's hard riding all night."

274
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:59,049
Jim came out first, and carefully assisted
out his old mother, who clung to his arm,

275
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,759
and looked anxiously about, as if she
expected the pursuer every moment.

276
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,700
"Jim, are your pistols all in order?" said
George, in a low, firm voice.

277
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,489
"Yes, indeed," said Jim.
"And you've no doubt what you shall do, if

278
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:14,909
they come?"

279
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:20,049
"I rather think I haven't," said Jim,
throwing open his broad chest, and taking a

280
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,360
deep breath.
"Do you think I'll let them get mother

281
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,730
again?"

282
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,559
During this brief colloquy, Eliza had been
taking her leave of her kind friend,

283
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,440
Rachel, and was handed into the carriage by
Simeon, and, creeping into the back part

284
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:36,419
with her boy, sat down among the buffalo-
skins.

285
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:42,869
The old woman was next handed in and seated
and George and Jim placed on a rough board

286
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,909
seat front of them, and Phineas mounted in
front.

287
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,399
"Farewell, my friends," said Simeon, from
without.

288
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:55,330
"God bless you!" answered all from within.
And the wagon drove off, rattling and

289
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,009
jolting over the frozen road.

290
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,149
There was no opportunity for conversation,
on account of the roughness of the way and

291
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,519
the noise of the wheels.

292
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,149
The vehicle, therefore, rumbled on, through
long, dark stretches of woodland,--over

293
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:15,570
wide dreary plains,--up hills, and down
valleys,--and on, on, on they jogged, hour

294
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,129
after hour.

295
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:20,220
The child soon fell asleep, and lay heavily
in his mother's lap.

296
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,899
The poor, frightened old woman at last
forgot her fears; and, even Eliza, as the

297
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:30,829
night waned, found all her anxieties
insufficient to keep her eyes from closing.

298
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,489
Phineas seemed, on the whole, the briskest
of the company, and beguiled his long drive

299
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:40,019
with whistling certain very unquaker-like
songs, as he went on.

300
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,600
But about three o'clock George's ear caught
the hasty and decided click of a horse's

301
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,090
hoof coming behind them at some distance
and jogged Phineas by the elbow.

302
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,730
Phineas pulled up his horses, and listened.

303
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,179
"That must be Michael," he said; "I think I
know the sound of his gallop;" and he rose

304
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,799
up and stretched his head anxiously back
over the road.

305
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:06,149
A man riding in hot haste was now dimly
descried at the top of a distant hill.

306
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,049
"There he is, I do believe!" said Phineas.
George and Jim both sprang out of the wagon

307
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,889
before they knew what they were doing.

308
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:16,590
All stood intensely silent, with their
faces turned towards the expected

309
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,419
messenger.
On he came.

310
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:22,999
Now he went down into a valley, where they
could not see him; but they heard the

311
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:28,409
sharp, hasty tramp, rising nearer and
nearer; at last they saw him emerge on the

312
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,179
top of an eminence, within hail.

313
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,320
"Yes, that's Michael!" said Phineas; and,
raising his voice, "Halloa, there,

314
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,259
Michael!"
"Phineas! is that thee?"

315
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:41,169
"Yes; what news--they coming?"

316
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:45,850
"Right on behind, eight or ten of them, hot
with brandy, swearing and foaming like so

317
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,870
many wolves."

318
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,889
And, just as he spoke, a breeze brought the
faint sound of galloping horsemen towards

319
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:55,159
them.
"In with you,--quick, boys, in!" said

320
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:55,710
Phineas.

321
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,470
"If you must fight, wait till I get you a
piece ahead."

322
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,019
And, with the word, both jumped in, and
Phineas lashed the horses to a run, the

323
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,409
horseman keeping close beside them.

324
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,440
The wagon rattled, jumped, almost flew,
over the frozen ground; but plainer, and

325
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,840
still plainer, came the noise of pursuing
horsemen behind.

326
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,499
The women heard it, and, looking anxiously
out, saw, far in the rear, on the brow of a

327
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:24,840
distant hill, a party of men looming up
against the red-streaked sky of early dawn.

328
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,629
Another hill, and their pursuers had
evidently caught sight of their wagon,

329
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:34,529
whose white cloth-covered top made it
conspicuous at some distance, and a loud

330
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,669
yell of brutal triumph came forward on the
wind.

331
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:42,379
Eliza sickened, and strained her child
closer to her bosom; the old woman prayed

332
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:47,039
and groaned, and George and Jim clenched
their pistols with the grasp of despair.

333
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:52,529
The pursuers gained on them fast; the
carriage made a sudden turn, and brought

334
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:57,409
them near a ledge of a steep overhanging
rock, that rose in an isolated ridge or

335
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,730
clump in a large lot, which was, all around
it, quite clear and smooth.

336
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:07,840
This isolated pile, or range of rocks, rose
up black and heavy against the brightening

337
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,909
sky, and seemed to promise shelter and
concealment.

338
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,989
It was a place well known to Phineas, who
had been familiar with the spot in his

339
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:18,980
hunting days; and it was to gain this point
he had been racing his horses.

340
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,649
"Now for it!" said he, suddenly checking
his horses, and springing from his seat to

341
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:26,190
the ground.
"Out with you, in a twinkling, every one,

342
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,519
and up into these rocks with me.

343
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,970
Michael, thee tie thy horse to the wagon,
and drive ahead to Amariah's and get him

344
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,080
and his boys to come back and talk to these
fellows."

345
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,539
In a twinkling they were all out of the
carriage.

346
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,899
"There," said Phineas, catching up Harry,
"you, each of you, see to the women; and

347
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,019
run, now if you ever did run!"

348
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:47,429
They needed no exhortation.

349
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:51,979
Quicker than we can say it, the whole party
were over the fence, making with all speed

350
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:56,030
for the rocks, while Michael, throwing
himself from his horse, and fastening the

351
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:58,799
bridle to the wagon, began driving it
rapidly away.

352
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,350
"Come ahead," said Phineas, as they reached
the rocks, and saw in the mingled starlight

353
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,559
and dawn, the traces of a rude but plainly
marked foot-path leading up among them;

354
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,600
"this is one of our old hunting-dens.

355
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,210
Come up!"
Phineas went before, springing up the rocks

356
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,350
like a goat, with the boy in his arms.

357
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,479
Jim came second, bearing his trembling old
mother over his shoulder, and George and

358
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,820
Eliza brought up the rear.

359
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,539
The party of horsemen came up to the fence,
and, with mingled shouts and oaths, were

360
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,549
dismounting, to prepare to follow them.

361
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:34,690
A few moments' scrambling brought them to
the top of the ledge; the path then passed

362
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,580
between a narrow defile, where only one
could walk at a time, till suddenly they

363
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,169
came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in

364
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,799
breadth, and beyond which lay a pile of
rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge,

365
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,889
standing full thirty feet high, with its
sides steep and perpendicular as those of a

366
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:53,229
castle.

367
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:57,869
Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat
down the boy on a smooth, flat platform of

368
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,619
crisp white moss, that covered the top of
the rock.

369
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,690
"Over with you!" he called; "spring, now,
once, for your lives!" said he, as one

370
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,289
after another sprang across.

371
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:12,190
Several fragments of loose stone formed a
kind of breast-work, which sheltered their

372
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,090
position from the observation of those
below.

373
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,629
"Well, here we all are," said Phineas,
peeping over the stone breast-work to watch

374
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:22,889
the assailants, who were coming
tumultuously up under the rocks.

375
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,639
"Let 'em get us, if they can.

376
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:29,789
Whoever comes here has to walk single file
between those two rocks, in fair range of

377
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:33,919
your pistols, boys, d'ye see?"
"I do see," said George!

378
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,679
"and now, as this matter is ours, let us
take all the risk, and do all the

379
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,529
fighting."

380
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,090
"Thee's quite welcome to do the fighting,
George," said Phineas, chewing some

381
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,699
checkerberry-leaves as he spoke; "but I may
have the fun of looking on, I suppose.

382
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,320
But see, these fellows are kinder debating
down there, and looking up, like hens when

383
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,349
they are going to fly up on to the roost.

384
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,669
Hadn't thee better give 'em a word of
advice, before they come up, just to tell

385
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,820
'em handsomely they'll be shot if they do?"

386
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,509
The party beneath, now more apparent in the
light of the dawn, consisted of our old

387
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:13,359
acquaintances, Tom Loker and Marks, with
two constables, and a posse consisting of

388
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,789
such rowdies at the last tavern as could be

389
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,899
engaged by a little brandy to go and help
the fun of trapping a set of niggers.

390
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:24,520
"Well, Tom, yer coons are farly treed,"
said one.

391
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:30,190
"Yes, I see 'em go up right here," said
Tom; "and here's a path.

392
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,789
I'm for going right up.
They can't jump down in a hurry, and it

393
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,309
won't take long to ferret 'em out."

394
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:39,979
"But, Tom, they might fire at us from
behind the rocks," said Marks.

395
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:44,269
"That would be ugly, you know."
"Ugh!" said Tom, with a sneer.

396
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,519
"Always for saving your skin, Marks!

397
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:52,009
No danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!"
"I don't know why I shouldn't save my

398
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,580
skin," said Marks.
"It's the best I've got; and niggers do

399
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,679
fight like the devil, sometimes."

400
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,820
At this moment, George appeared on the top
of a rock above them, and, speaking in a

401
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,279
calm, clear voice, said,
"Gentlemen, who are you, down there, and

402
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,049
what do you want?"

403
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:13,269
"We want a party of runaway niggers," said
Tom Loker.

404
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:19,269
"One George Harris, and Eliza Harris, and
their son, and Jim Selden, and an old

405
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,330
woman.

406
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,499
We've got the officers, here, and a warrant
to take 'em; and we're going to have 'em,

407
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:25,899
too.
D'ye hear?

408
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:32,460
An't you George Harris, that belongs to Mr.
Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?"

409
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,749
"I am George Harris.
A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his

410
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:39,080
property.

411
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,489
But now I'm a free man, standing on God's
free soil; and my wife and my child I claim

412
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:49,149
as mine.
Jim and his mother are here.

413
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:52,129
We have arms to defend ourselves, and we
mean to do it.

414
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,649
You can come up, if you like; but the first
one of you that comes within the range of

415
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:04,419
our bullets is a dead man, and the next,
and the next; and so on till the last."

416
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:09,070
"O, come! come!" said a short, puffy man,
stepping forward, and blowing his nose as

417
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,749
he did so.
"Young man, this an't no kind of talk at

418
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:13,710
all for you.

419
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,279
You see, we're officers of justice.
We've got the law on our side, and the

420
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,899
power, and so forth; so you'd better give
up peaceably, you see; for you'll certainly

421
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:25,059
have to give up, at last."

422
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:31,259
"I know very well that you've got the law
on your side, and the power," said George,

423
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:31,849
bitterly.

424
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:37,879
"You mean to take my wife to sell in New
Orleans, and put my boy like a calf in a

425
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:42,899
trader's pen, and send Jim's old mother to
the brute that whipped and abused her

426
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:46,309
before, because he couldn't abuse her son.

427
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,679
You want to send Jim and me back to be
whipped and tortured, and ground down under

428
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:56,940
the heels of them that you call masters;
and your laws will bear you out in it,--

429
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,539
more shame for you and them!

430
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,080
But you haven't got us.

431
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,419
We don't own your laws; we don't own your
country; we stand here as free, under God's

432
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:13,639
sky, as you are; and, by the great God that
made us, we'll fight for our liberty till

433
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,590
we die."

434
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,840
George stood out in fair sight, on the top
of the rock, as he made his declaration of

435
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,970
independence; the glow of dawn gave a flush
to his swarthy cheek, and bitter

436
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,729
indignation and despair gave fire to his

437
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:33,409
dark eye; and, as if appealing from man to
the justice of God, he raised his hand to

438
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:35,039
heaven as he spoke.

439
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,179
If it had been only a Hungarian youth, now
bravely defending in some mountain fastness

440
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,659
the retreat of fugitives escaping from
Austria into America, this would have been

441
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,109
sublime heroism; but as it was a youth of

442
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:54,139
African descent, defending the retreat of
fugitives through America into Canada, of

443
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:58,859
course we are too well instructed and
patriotic to see any heroism in it; and if

444
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,389
any of our readers do, they must do it on
their own private responsibility.

445
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,700
When despairing Hungarian fugitives make
their way, against all the search-warrants

446
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,809
and authorities of their lawful government,
to America, press and political cabinet

447
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:16,190
ring with applause and welcome.

448
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,949
When despairing African fugitives do the
same thing,--it is--what is it?

449
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:28,470
Be it as it may, it is certain that the
attitude, eye, voice, manner, of the

450
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,309
speaker for a moment struck the party below
to silence.

451
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:36,080
There is something in boldness and
determination that for a time hushes even

452
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,979
the rudest nature.
Marks was the only one who remained wholly

453
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,080
untouched.

454
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,450
He was deliberately cocking his pistol,
and, in the momentary silence that followed

455
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,279
George's speech, he fired at him.

456
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,509
"Ye see ye get jist as much for him dead as
alive in Kentucky," he said coolly, as he

457
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,570
wiped his pistol on his coat-sleeve.

458
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:01,119
George sprang backward,--Eliza uttered a
shriek,--the ball had passed close to his

459
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,649
hair, had nearly grazed the cheek of his
wife, and struck in the tree above.

460
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:07,960
"It's nothing, Eliza," said George,
quickly.

461
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,649
"Thee'd better keep out of sight, with thy
speechifying," said Phineas; "they're mean

462
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:13,719
scamps."

463
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:19,279
"Now, Jim," said George, "look that your
pistols are all right, and watch that pass

464
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,580
with me.
The first man that shows himself I fire at;

465
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,690
you take the second, and so on.

466
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,849
It won't do, you know, to waste two shots
on one."

467
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:32,929
"But what if you don't hit?"
"I shall hit," said George, coolly.

468
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:37,489
"Good! now, there's stuff in that fellow,"
muttered Phineas, between his teeth.

469
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:41,460
The party below, after Marks had fired,
stood, for a moment, rather undecided.

470
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:46,259
"I think you must have hit some on 'em,"
said one of the men.

471
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:51,379
"I heard a squeal!"
"I'm going right up for one," said Tom.

472
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:54,779
"I never was afraid of niggers, and I an't
going to be now.

473
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,929
Who goes after?" he said, springing up the
rocks.

474
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,729
George heard the words distinctly.

475
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:04,849
He drew up his pistol, examined it, pointed
it towards that point in the defile where

476
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,460
the first man would appear.

477
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:11,460
One of the most courageous of the party
followed Tom, and, the way being thus made,

478
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,739
the whole party began pushing up the rock,-
-the hindermost pushing the front ones

479
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:18,969
faster than they would have gone of
themselves.

480
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:23,009
On they came, and in a moment the burly
form of Tom appeared in sight, almost at

481
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,859
the verge of the chasm.

482
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:30,559
George fired,--the shot entered his side,--
but, though wounded, he would not retreat,

483
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,419
but, with a yell like that of a mad bull,
he was leaping right across the chasm into

484
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,029
the party.

485
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,179
"Friend," said Phineas, suddenly stepping
to the front, and meeting him with a push

486
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,979
from his long arms, "thee isn't wanted
here."

487
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:48,249
Down he fell into the chasm, crackling down
among trees, bushes, logs, loose stones,

488
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,240
till he lay bruised and groaning thirty
feet below.

489
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:55,849
The fall might have killed him, had it not
been broken and moderated by his clothes

490
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,480
catching in the branches of a large tree;
but he came down with some force, however,-

491
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:03,529
-more than was at all agreeable or
convenient.

492
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,690
"Lord help us, they are perfect devils!"
said Marks, heading the retreat down the

493
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,999
rocks with much more of a will than he had
joined the ascent, while all the party came

494
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:15,479
tumbling precipitately after him,--the fat

495
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:19,239
constable, in particular, blowing and
puffing in a very energetic manner.

496
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:24,200
"I say, fellers," said Marks, "you jist go
round and pick up Tom, there, while I run

497
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,009
and get on to my horse to go back for
help,--that's you;" and, without minding

498
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,460
the hootings and jeers of his company,

499
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,909
Marks was as good as his word, and was soon
seen galloping away.

500
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:39,919
"Was ever such a sneaking varmint?" said
one of the men; "to come on his business,

501
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,269
and he clear out and leave us this yer
way!"

502
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:46,809
"Well, we must pick up that feller," said
another.

503
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,379
"Cuss me if I much care whether he is dead
or alive."

504
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:54,669
The men, led by the groans of Tom,
scrambled and crackled through stumps, logs

505
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:59,110
and bushes, to where that hero lay groaning
and swearing with alternate vehemence.

506
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,969
"Ye keep it agoing pretty loud, Tom," said
one.

507
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,989
"Ye much hurt?"
"Don't know.

508
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,580
Get me up, can't ye?

509
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,790
Blast that infernal Quaker!
If it hadn't been for him, I'd a pitched

510
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,129
some on 'em down here, to see how they
liked it."

511
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:19,399
With much labor and groaning, the fallen
hero was assisted to rise; and, with one

512
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,770
holding him up under each shoulder, they
got him as far as the horses.

513
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:26,889
"If you could only get me a mile back to
that ar tavern.

514
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,179
Give me a handkerchief or something, to
stuff into this place, and stop this

515
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,429
infernal bleeding."

516
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,339
George looked over the rocks, and saw them
trying to lift the burly form of Tom into

517
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:40,359
the saddle.
After two or three ineffectual attempts, he

518
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,450
reeled, and fell heavily to the ground.

519
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,349
"O, I hope he isn't killed!" said Eliza,
who, with all the party, stood watching the

520
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:51,299
proceeding.
"Why not?" said Phineas; "serves him

521
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,589
right."

522
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:56,779
"Because after death comes the judgment,"
said Eliza.

523
00:34:56,779 --> 00:35:00,329
"Yes," said the old woman, who had been
groaning and praying, in her Methodist

524
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:05,160
fashion, during all the encounter, "it's an
awful case for the poor crittur's soul."

525
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:09,970
"On my word, they're leaving him, I do
believe," said Phineas.

526
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,569
It was true; for after some appearance of
irresolution and consultation, the whole

527
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,779
party got on their horses and rode away.

528
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:22,180
When they were quite out of sight, Phineas
began to bestir himself.

529
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,930
"Well, we must go down and walk a piece,"
he said.

530
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,990
"I told Michael to go forward and bring
help, and be along back here with the

531
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,829
wagon; but we shall have to walk a piece
along the road, I reckon, to meet them.

532
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,130
The Lord grant he be along soon!

533
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,859
It's early in the day; there won't be much
travel afoot yet a while; we an't much more

534
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:46,079
than two miles from our stopping-place.
If the road hadn't been so rough last

535
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,099
night, we could have outrun 'em entirely."

536
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:52,400
As the party neared the fence, they
discovered in the distance, along the road,

537
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,529
their own wagon coming back, accompanied by
some men on horseback.

538
00:35:56,299 --> 00:36:01,779
"Well, now, there's Michael, and Stephen
and Amariah," exclaimed Phineas, joyfully.

539
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:04,470
"Now we are made--as safe as if we'd got
there."

540
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,660
"Well, do stop, then," said Eliza, "and do
something for that poor man; he's groaning

541
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,510
dreadfully."

542
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:17,279
"It would be no more than Christian," said
George; "let's take him up and carry him

543
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:21,329
on."
"And doctor him up among the Quakers!" said

544
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:22,760
Phineas; "pretty well, that!

545
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,289
Well, I don't care if we do.

546
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,380
Here, let's have a look at him;" and
Phineas, who in the course of his hunting

547
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,240
and backwoods life had acquired some rude
experience of surgery, kneeled down by the

548
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:38,240
wounded man, and began a careful
examination of his condition.

549
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,980
"Marks," said Tom, feebly, "is that you,
Marks?"

550
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,420
"No; I reckon 'tan't friend," said Phineas.

551
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,410
"Much Marks cares for thee, if his own
skin's safe.

552
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,359
He's off, long ago."
"I believe I'm done for," said Tom.

553
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,869
"The cussed sneaking dog, to leave me to
die alone!

554
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:00,529
My poor old mother always told me 't would
be so."

555
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,770
"La sakes! jist hear the poor crittur.

556
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,170
He's got a mammy, now," said the old
negress.

557
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,700
"I can't help kinder pityin' on him."

558
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,500
"Softly, softly; don't thee snap and snarl,
friend," said Phineas, as Tom winced and

559
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,480
pushed his hand away.
"Thee has no chance, unless I stop the

560
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,819
bleeding."

561
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:26,010
And Phineas busied himself with making some
off-hand surgical arrangements with his own

562
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,370
pocket-handkerchief, and such as could be
mustered in the company.

563
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,839
"You pushed me down there," said Tom,
faintly.

564
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,099
"Well if I hadn't thee would have pushed us
down, thee sees," said Phineas, as he

565
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,670
stooped to apply his bandage.

566
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:48,079
"There, there,--let me fix this bandage.
We mean well to thee; we bear no malice.

567
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,829
Thee shall be taken to a house where
they'll nurse thee first rate, well as thy

568
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:54,829
own mother could."

569
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:57,000
Tom groaned, and shut his eyes.

570
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,430
In men of his class, vigor and resolution
are entirely a physical matter, and ooze

571
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:07,190
out with the flowing of the blood; and the
gigantic fellow really looked piteous in

572
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,779
his helplessness.

573
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:12,600
The other party now came up.
The seats were taken out of the wagon.

574
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,599
The buffalo-skins, doubled in fours, were
spread all along one side, and four men,

575
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,420
with great difficulty, lifted the heavy
form of Tom into it.

576
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,240
Before he was gotten in, he fainted
entirely.

577
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,980
The old negress, in the abundance of her
compassion, sat down on the bottom, and

578
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,049
took his head in her lap.

579
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:35,630
Eliza, George and Jim, bestowed themselves,
as well as they could, in the remaining

580
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,760
space and the whole party set forward.
"What do you think of him?" said George,

581
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,000
who sat by Phineas in front.

582
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,029
"Well it's only a pretty deep flesh-wound;
but, then, tumbling and scratching down

583
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:49,619
that place didn't help him much.

584
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,770
It has bled pretty freely,--pretty much
drained him out, courage and all,--but

585
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:59,089
he'll get over it, and may be learn a thing
or two by it."

586
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,180
"I'm glad to hear you say so," said George.

587
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,670
"It would always be a heavy thought to me,
if I'd caused his death, even in a just

588
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,290
cause."

589
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:12,930
"Yes," said Phineas, "killing is an ugly
operation, any way they'll fix it,--man or

590
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,079
beast.

591
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:17,920
I've seen a buck that was shot down and a
dying, look that way on a feller with his

592
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,099
eye, that it reely most made a feller feel
wicked for killing on him; and human

593
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,510
creatures is a more serious consideration

594
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,569
yet, bein', as thy wife says, that the
judgment comes to 'em after death.

595
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,210
So I don't know as our people's notions on
these matters is too strict; and,

596
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,630
considerin' how I was raised, I fell in
with them pretty considerably."

597
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,390
"What shall you do with this poor fellow?"
said George.

598
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,750
"O, carry him along to Amariah's.

599
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,599
There's old Grandmam Stephens there,--
Dorcas, they call her,--she's most an

600
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,710
amazin' nurse.

601
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,559
She takes to nursing real natural, and an't
never better suited than when she gets a

602
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,180
sick body to tend.
We may reckon on turning him over to her

603
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,960
for a fortnight or so."

604
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,920
A ride of about an hour more brought the
party to a neat farmhouse, where the weary

605
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,430
travellers were received to an abundant
breakfast.

606
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:17,079
Tom Loker was soon carefully deposited in a
much cleaner and softer bed than he had

607
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,689
ever been in the habit of occupying.

608
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,819
His wound was carefully dressed and
bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and

609
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:28,460
shutting his eyes on the white window-
curtains and gently-gliding figures of his

610
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,130
sick room, like a weary child.

611
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,720
And here, for the present, we shall take
our leave of one party.

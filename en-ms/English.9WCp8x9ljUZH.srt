1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,280
I've done a bunch of videos
already on respiration.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,440
I think even before those
videos, you had a sense that

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,510
we need oxygen and that
we release CO2.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,190
And if you watched the videos on
respiration, you know that

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,490
we need the oxygen in order to
metabolize our food, in order

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,980
to turn our food into ATPs
that can then drive other

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,300
types of cellular functions--
or anything that we have to

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,030
do; move, or breathe, or think,
or everything that we

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,480
have to do.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,830
And that through the process of
respiration, we break down

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,210
those sugars and we release
carbon dioxide.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,980
So in this video, what I want to
do is take a big step back

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,770
and think about how we actually
get our oxygen into

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,480
our body and how we release it
back out into the atmosphere.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,620
Another way to think about it is
how we ventilate ourselves.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,020
How do we get the oxygen in, and
how do we get the carbon

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,200
dioxide out?

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,560
And I think any of us could at
least start off this video.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,030
It starts off in either
our nose or our mouth.

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,830
I always have a clogged sinus
so I often have to

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,720
deal with my mouth.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,110
I sleep with my mouth often.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,350
But it always starts in our
nose or our mouths.

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,850
Let me draw someone with
a nose and a mouth.

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,850
So let's say that this
is my person.

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,865
Maybe his mouth will be open
so that he can breathe.

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,380
His eyes aren't important,
but just so

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,800
you know it's a person.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,610
So this is my test subject
or the person I'm

30
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,900
going to use to diagram.

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,340
That's his ear.

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,485
Maybe he has a bit of a-- let's
give him some hair.

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,790
All of that is irrelevant,
but this is our guy.

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,200
This is the guy that's going to
show us how we take air in

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,120
and how we take air
out of the body.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,910
So let's go inside
of this guy.

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,680
I can draw his outside
first. Let me see how

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,510
well I can do this.

39
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,390
So this is outside the guy.

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,440
That doesn't look right.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,419
Let's say the guy looks
something like this and he's

42
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,900
got-- this is his shoulders.

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,010
That's our guy.

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,900
All right.

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,200
So in our mouth, we have our
oral cavity right there, which

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,650
is just the space that
our mouth creates.

47
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,770
We have our oral cavity.

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,960
I could draw our tongue and all
of that and maybe I will.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,055
Maybe I'll draw the tongue.

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,780
But you have this space inside
of the mouth-- call that the

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,030
oral cavity.

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,340
Oral for mouth, cavity for
space, or hole, or opening.

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,700
And then also you have your
nostrils and they open up into

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,950
a nasal cavity.

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,310
So that's another big space
just like this.

56
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,800
And we know that they connect at
the back of our nose or the

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,020
back of our mouth.

58
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,880
And this passage right here
where they connect is called

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,130
the pharynx.

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,640
When your air goes through your
nose-- they say breathing

61
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,680
through your nose is better,
probably because it gets

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,820
filtered by your nose hairs and
it gets warmed up and and

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,180
what not, but you can breathe
through either side.

64
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,900
The air goes in through either
your nasal cavity or your oral

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,420
cavity and then comes back
through your pharynx and then

66
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,220
the pharynx splits
into two pipes.

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,140
One for-- well, one, air can
go down either one, but the

68
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,660
other one is for food.

69
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,700
So your pharynx gets split.

70
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,720
In the back you have your
esophagus-- and we'll talk

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,290
more about the esophagus
in a future video.

72
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,540
In the back you have your
esophagus and in the front--

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,030
let me draw a little dividing
line there.

74
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,370
In the front, maybe this-- let
me make it connect like that.

75
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,320
I was using yellow.

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,870
I'm going to use yellow to
continue and I'm going to use

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,730
green for the air.

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,526
So it divides just like that.

79
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,550
So behind your air pipe, you
have your esophagus.

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,720
Let me make that
another color.

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
And then right here
is your larynx.

82
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,460
And I'm going to concern
ourselves with the larynx.

83
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,440
Esophagus is where your
food goes down.

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,910
We know that we eat food
with our mouth as well.

85
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,710
So this is where we
want our food to

86
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,310
go-- down the esophagus.

87
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,700
But the focus of this video
is our ventilation.

88
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,600
What do we do with our air?

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,260
So I'm going to focus as the air
goes through our larynx.

90
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,030
And the larynx is also
our voicebox.

91
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,460
So as you hear me talking right
now, there are these

92
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,360
little things right about here
that are vibrating at just the

93
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,900
right frequencies and I'm able
to shape the sound with my

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,330
mouth to make this video.

95
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,340
So that's also your voicebox,
but I won't focus

96
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,180
on that right now.

97
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,770
It's called a voicebox because
of this whole anatomical

98
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,580
structure that looks something
like that.

99
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,610
But then after the air passes
through the larynx-- this is

100
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:31,580
on the way in-- it goes to the
trachea, which is essentially

101
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,830
just the pipe for air.

102
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,170
The esophagus is the
pipe for food.

103
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,420
Let me write this down.

104
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
And then from the trachea-- and
the trachea is actually a

105
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,590
reasonably rigid structure.

106
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,780
It has cartilage around
it and it makes

107
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,970
sense that it has cartilage.

108
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,290
You don't want-- you can imagine
a hose-- if it bent a

109
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,240
lot, you wouldn't be able to get
a lot of water through it,

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,310
or a lot of air through it.

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,530
So you don't want this
thing to bend a lot.

112
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,630
So that's why it needs to have
some rigidity-- so that's why

113
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,930
it has cartilage around it.

114
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,090
And then it splits into two
tubes-- and I think you know

115
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,270
where these two tubes
are going to.

116
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,590
And I'm not drawing this
in super detail.

117
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,410
I just want you to get the idea
of them, but these two

118
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,770
tubes are the bronchi-- or
each one is a bronchus.

119
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,550
And they also have cartilage,
so they're fairly rigid, but

120
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,480
the bronchi keep splitting.

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,140
They keep splitting into smaller
and smaller tubes just

122
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,320
like that and at some point,
they stop having cartilage.

123
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,690
They stop being reasonably
rigid, but they

124
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,290
keep splitting off.

125
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,030
So I'll just draw them as
these little lines.

126
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,530
At some point they become
such thin things.

127
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,170
They just keep splitting off.

128
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,560
So the air just keeps splitting
off and spread and

129
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,100
goes down the different paths.

130
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,400
And when the bronchi no longer
have cartilage around them,

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,490
they're no longer rigid.

132
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,690
The first of those are called--
or actually all the

133
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,480
tubes after that point are
called bronchioles.

134
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,630
These are bronchioles.

135
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,630
So for example, that we could
call a bronchiole.

136
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,225
And there's nothing
fancy here.

137
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,380
It's just a pipe that
just gets thinner

138
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,110
and thinner and thinner.

139
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,920
We've labeled the different
parts of the pipes different

140
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,380
things, but the idea is, let's
take it through our mouth or

141
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,020
our nose and we just keep
dividing and keep dividing

142
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,310
this main division into two
different paths that takes us

143
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,550
into each of our lungs.

144
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,010
Let me draw this guy's
lungs here.

145
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,590
And these bronchi-- or the
bronchi split into the lungs--

146
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,720
the bronchioles are in the
lungs and eventually the

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,660
bronchioles terminate.

148
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,020
And this is where it
gets interesting.

149
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,500
They keep dividing smaller and
smaller, thinner and thinner

150
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,110
and thinner, into these little
air sacs, just like that.

151
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,770
At the end of every super small
bronchiole are these

152
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,500
little air sacs-- super small
air sacs-- and I'm going to

153
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,060
talk about these air
sacs in a second.

154
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,310
And these are called alveoli.

155
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,700
So I've used a lot of
fancy words, but the

156
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,860
general idea is simple.

157
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,050
Air comes in through a pipe.

158
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,020
The pipe gets thinner and
thinner and thinner and they

159
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,760
end up at these little
air sacs.

160
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,450
And you're saying, well,
how does that get the

161
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,930
oxygen into my system?

162
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,460
Well, the key here is that these
air sacs are super small

163
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,950
and have very, very, very
thin walls-- or

164
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,059
I guess thin membranes.

165
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,700
So let me zoom in.

166
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,740
So if I were to zoom in on one
of these alveoli-- and just to

167
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,950
give you an idea, these are
super duper duper small.

168
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,799
I've drawn them fairly large
here, but each alveoli-- let

169
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,930
me draw a little bit bigger.

170
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,780
Let me draw these air sacs.

171
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,840
So you have these air
sacs like this.

172
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,290
And then you have a
bronchiole that's

173
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,600
terminating in that air sac.

174
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,320
Maybe a bronchiole is
terminating in another air sac

175
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,820
just like that-- another set
of air sacs just like that.

176
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,300
Each of these are only 200 to
300 microns in diameter.

177
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,530
So that distance right there--
let me switch colors-- that

178
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,720
distance right there is
200 to 300 microns.

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,050
And in case you don't know what
a micron is, a micron is

180
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,200
a millionth of a meter--
or you can view it as a

181
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,820
thousandth of a millimeter.

182
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,340
So this is 200 thousandths
of a millimeter.

183
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,890
Or you can think of them as--
and this is actually a very

184
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,730
easy way to visualize it-- this
is about one fifth of a

185
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,920
millimeter.

186
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,790
So if I actually try to draw it
on the screen-- if you made

187
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,600
this full screen, a millimeter
is about that far.

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,690
Maybe a little farther
than that.

189
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,130
Maybe about that far.

190
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,530
So imagine a fifth of that and
that's what we're talking

191
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,580
about the diameter of
one of these things.

192
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,470
And just to put it in the
whole scheme relative to

193
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,330
cells, the average
cell in the human

194
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,760
body is about 10 microns.

195
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,450
So this is only about 20 or 30
cells in diameter or relative

196
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,600
to the average cell
in the human body.

197
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,360
So these have a super
thin membrane.

198
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,480
If you view them as balloons,
the balloon is very thin--

199
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,260
pretty much one cell thick and
they're connected to the

200
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,410
bloodflow-- or actually, a
better way to think about is

201
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,540
that our circulatory system
passes right next to each of

202
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,100
these things.

203
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,580
So you have blood vessels that
come from the heart and they

204
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,860
want to be oxygenated.

205
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,810
In general, the blood vessels
that don't have oxygen-- and

206
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,900
I'm going to do this in a lot
more detail when I make the

207
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,250
videos about the heart and our
circulation system-- the blood

208
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,570
vessels that don't have oxygen--
de-oxygenated blood

209
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,420
is a little bit darker.

210
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,770
It looks a little
bit purplish.

211
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,400
So I'll draw it as blue.

212
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,890
So these are vessels that are
coming from the heart.

213
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,060
So this blood right here has no
oxygen in it or it's been

214
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,650
de-oxygenated or it has very
little oxygen in it.

215
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,520
And the word for the blood
vessels that comes from the

216
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,010
heart are arteries.

217
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,760
Let me write that down.

218
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,290
I'll review that again when
we cover it in the heart.

219
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:21,590
So arteries are blood vessels
from the heart.

220
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,770
And you've probably
heard of arteries.

221
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,190
Vessels that go to the heart
are called veins.

222
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,160
This is really important to keep
in mind because later on,

223
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,270
you're going to see that
arteries don't always carry

224
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,100
oxygen or they're always not
de-oxygenated and veins always

225
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,900
aren't one way or the other.

226
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,520
We're going to go into a lot
more detail when we actually

227
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,780
cover the heart and the
circulatory system, but just

228
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,630
remember, arteries go away.

229
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,510
Veins go to the heart.

230
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,610
So here, these are arteries
going away from the heart to

231
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,020
the lungs, to the alveoli
because they want the blood

232
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,310
that's traveling in them
to get oxygen.

233
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,720
So what's going to happen is
that the air is flowing

234
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,060
through the bronchioles and
circulating around the

235
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,650
alveoli, filling the alveoli--
and as they fill the alveoli,

236
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:27,680
the little molecules of oxygen
are allowed to cross the

237
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,220
membrane of the alveoli
and essentially be

238
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,530
absorbed into the blood.

239
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,850
I'll do a lot more on that when
we talk about hemoglobin

240
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,740
and red blood cells, but you
just have to realize that

241
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,920
there's just a lot
of capillaries.

242
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,810
Capillaries are just super small
blood vessels that allow

243
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,850
air to pass-- essentially oxygen
and carbon dioxide

244
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,560
molecules to pass
between them.

245
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,580
These have a lot of capillaries
on them that allow

246
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,450
the exchange of gases.

247
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,470
So the oxygen can go into this
blood and so once the oxygen--

248
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,310
so this is the vessel that's
coming from the heart and then

249
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,100
it's just a tube.

250
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,710
So then once it gets the oxygen,
it's going to go back

251
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,960
to the heart.

252
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,790
And so essentially this is the
point where this vessel, this

253
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,840
pipe, part of our circulatory
system, goes from being an

254
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,745
artery-- because it's coming
from the heart-- to a vein

255
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,320
because it's going back
to the heart.

256
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,010
And there's a special word for
these arteries and veins.

257
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,900
They're called pulmonary
arteries and veins.

258
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,980
So going away from the heart to
the lungs, to the alveoli,

259
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,840
these are the pulmonary
arteries.

260
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,775
And going back to the heart
are the pulmonary veins.

261
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,090
Now you're saying, Sal, what
does pulmonary mean?

262
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,920
Well, pulmo comes from the
Latin for the lungs.

263
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,090
It literally means the arteries
that are of the lungs

264
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,380
or that go to the lungs
and the veins that

265
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,300
come from the lungs.

266
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,840
So anytime people talk about
pulmonary anything, they're

267
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,200
talking about our lungs-- or
maybe something related to how

268
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,770
we breathe.

269
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,200
So it's a good word to know.

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,300
So anyway, you have your oxygen
coming in through your

271
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,670
mouth or your nose, through the
pharynx-- it could fill

272
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,200
your stomach.

273
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,550
We can blow up our stomach
like a balloon, but that

274
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,150
doesn't help us actually get
oxygen to our blood stream.

275
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,990
But the oxygen will come through
our larynx, into our

276
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,270
trachea, through the bronchi,
eventually in bronchioles,

277
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,120
ending up in alveoli and being
able to be absorbed into what

278
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,570
where the arteries, but then
we're going to go back and

279
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,490
then essentially oxygenate
the blood.

280
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,140
The red blood cells become red
once the hemoglobin becomes

281
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,980
very red or scarlet once it
actually has the oxygen and

282
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,300
then we go back.

283
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,140
But at the same time, this
isn't just about getting

284
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,850
oxygen into our arteries
or onto the hemoglobin.

285
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,110
It's also about releasing
carbon dioxide.

286
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,610
So these blue arteries coming
from the lungs are also going

287
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,730
to release carbon dioxide
into the alveoli.

288
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,560
And these will be exhaled.

289
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,360
So we have oxygen coming in.

290
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,110
Other things will be coming in,
but the O2 is what gets

291
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,790
absorbed in the alveoli.

292
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,680
And then when we breathe out,
we're going to have carbon

293
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,850
dioxide that was in our blood,
but then it gets absorbed into

294
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,840
the alveoli and they
get squeezed out.

295
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,685
I'm going to tell you in a
second how it gets squeezed.

296
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,120
It's actually that squeezing out
that actually-- when the

297
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,160
air goes back out, it can
vibrate my vocal cords and

298
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,210
it'll allow me to talk, but I'm
not going to go into too

299
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,620
much detail about that.

300
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,200
So the last thing to consider
about this whole pulmonary

301
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,360
system or about our lungs is,
how does it force the air in

302
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,690
and how does it force
the air out?

303
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,660
And the way it's done is really
kind of like a-- you

304
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,700
could imagine it's kind of a
pump or a balloon-- is that we

305
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,680
have this huge layer
of flat muscles.

306
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,170
Let me pick a good color here.

307
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,400
Right below the lungs--
and this is

308
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,650
called a thoracic diaphragm.

309
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,280
And so when it's relaxed, it
kind of has this arch shape,

310
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,700
and so the lungs are kind
of squeezed in.

311
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,440
They don't have a
lot of volume.

312
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,380
But when I essentially breathe
in, what's happening is this

313
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,170
thoracic diaphragm is contracted
and when it's

314
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,950
contracted, it gets shorter, but
more importantly, it opens

315
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,440
up the space where
my lungs are.

316
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,330
So my lungs can fill
up that space.

317
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,920
So what it does is, it
essentially-- it's like

318
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,420
pulling a balloon larger,
making the

319
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,064
volume of my lungs larger.

320
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:13,310
And when you make the volume of
something larger-- so the

321
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,000
lungs will become larger as
my thoracic diaphragm is

322
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,630
contracted and it kind of arches
down, creates more

323
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,150
space-- and as the volume of
something becomes larger, the

324
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,140
pressure inside of
them goes down.

325
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,420
If you remember from physics,
the pressure

326
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,720
times volume is a constant.

327
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,050
So when we breathe in, our brain
is essentially telling

328
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,300
our diaphragm to contract.

329
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,125
We have more space
around our lungs.

330
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:56,390
Our lungs expand to
fill the space.

331
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,870
We have less pressure here than
we have outside-- or you

332
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,540
can view it as negative
pressure.

333
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,440
So air always wants to go from
high pressure to low pressure

334
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,060
and so air is going to
flow into our lungs.

335
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,710
And hopefully there'll be some
oxygen there that can then

336
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,530
essentially go into our alveoli
and end up in our

337
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,190
arteries and then go back in the
veins as oxygen attached

338
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,820
to hemoglobin.

339
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,530
I'll talk more about
that in detail.

340
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,960
And then when we stop
contracting the diaphragm, it

341
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,980
goes back to this
arched position.

342
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,020
It contracts.

343
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,550
It's kind of like
a rubber band.

344
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,480
It contracts back the lungs and
it essentially expels the

345
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,780
air back and now that air's
going to have a lot more

346
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,120
carbon dioxide.

347
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,130
And just to get a sense of-- I
can look at my lungs-- I can't

348
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,130
look at them, but they
don't seem too large.

349
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,350
How do I get enough oxygen in
them-- and the key is, is that

350
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,090
because of this branching
process and the alveoli, the

351
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,920
inside surface area of the lungs
are actually much larger

352
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,310
than you can imagine-- or
actually than I could have

353
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,830
imagined had someone
not told me.

354
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,090
So it actually turns out-- I
looked it up-- the internal

355
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,650
surface area of your alveoli--
so the total surface area

356
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,470
where the oxygen can be absorbed
in or the carbon

357
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,950
dioxide can be absorbed out from
the blood-- it's actually

358
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,610
75 square meters.

359
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,910
That's meters, not feet.

360
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,730
If you think about it, that's
like a-- imagine some type of

361
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,310
a tarp or a field.

362
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,930
That's almost nine
by nine meters.

363
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:36,340
That's almost 27 by
27 square feet.

364
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,530
That's the size of some
people's backyards.

365
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,140
That's how much surface air you
have inside of your lungs.

366
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,240
It's all folded up.

367
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,310
That's how it gets jammed into
what look like relatively

368
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,220
small lungs.

369
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,410
But that's what gives us enough
surface area for enough

370
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,680
of the air, enough of the
oxygen, to cross the alveoli

371
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,980
membrane into our blood system
and enough of the carbon

372
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,560
dioxide to go back in.

373
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,370
And just to have a sense of how
many alveoli we had-- I

374
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,240
told you that they're very
small-- we actually have 300

375
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,410
million in each lung.

376
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,350
In each lung, we have
300 million alveoli.

377
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,020
So anyway, hopefully that gives
you a decent sense of

378
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,230
how we at least get oxygen
into our blood system and

379
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,640
carbon dioxide out of it.

380
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,200
In the next video, I'll talk
more about our actual

381
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,520
circulatory system and how we
get the oxygen from the lungs

382
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,240
to the rest of the body and
how do we get the carbon

383
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,640
dioxide from the rest of the
body into the lungs?

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,070
We've gone over the
general idea

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,610
behind mitosis and meiosis.

4
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,820
It's a good idea in
this video to go a

5
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,730
little bit more in detail.

6
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,230
I've already done a video on
mitosis, and in this one,

7
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,130
we'll go into the details
of meiosis.

8
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,710
Just as a review, mitosis, you
start with a diploid cell, and

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,270
you end up with two
diploid cells.

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,050
Essentially, it just
duplicates itself.

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,540
And formally, mitosis is really
the process of the

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,810
duplication of the nucleus, but
it normally ends up with

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,350
two entire cells.

14
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,119
Cytokinesis takes place.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,880
So this is mitosis.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,020
We have a video on it where we
go into the phases of it:

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,290
prophase, metaphase, anaphase
and telophase.

18
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,050

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,800
Mitosis occurs in pretty much
all of our somatic cells as

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,810
our skin cells replicate, and
our hair cells and all the

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,080
tissue in our body as it
duplicates itself, it goes

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,180
through mitosis.

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,970
Meiosis occurs in the germ
cells and it's used

24
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,960
essentially to produce gametes
to facilitate sexual

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,630
reproduction.

26
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,020
So if I start off with a diploid
cell, and that's my

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,560
diploid cell right there, this
would be a germ cell.

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,710
It's not just any cell
in the body.

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,670
It's a germ cell.

30
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,870
It could undergo mitosis to
produce more germ cells, but

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,780
we'll talk about how it
produces the gametes.

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,420
It actually goes under
two rounds.

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,960
They're combined, called
meiosis, but the first round

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,670
you could call it meiosis
1, so I'll call that M1.

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm not talking about the
money supply here.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,170
And in the first round of
meiosis, this diploid cell

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,270
essentially splits into
two haploid cells.

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,190
So if you started off with 43
chromosomes, formally have 23

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,110
chromosomes in each one, or you
can almost view it if you

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,240
have 23 pairs here, each have
two chromosomes, those pairs

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,930
get split into this stage.

42
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:06,850
And then in meiosis 2, these
things get split in a

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,050
mechanism very similar
to mitosis.

44
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,010
We'll see that when we actually

45
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,900
go through the phases.

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,160
In fact, the prophase,
metaphase, anaphase, telophase

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,795
also exist in each of these
phases of meiosis.

48
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:22,100
So let me just draw
the end product.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,490
The end product is you have four
cells and each of them

50
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,740
are haploid.

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,220

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,520
And you could already see, this
process right here, you

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,260
essentially split up your
chromosomes, because you end

54
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,790
up with half in each one, but
here, you start with N and you

55
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,180
end up with two chromosomes that
each have N, so it's very

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,760
similar to this.

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,380
You preserve the number
of chromosomes.

58
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,390
So let's delve into the details
of how it all happens.

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,290
So all cells spend most of
their time in interphase.

60
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,910
Interphase is just a time when
the cell is living and

61
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,770
transcribing and doing
what it needs to do.

62
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,030
But just like in mitosis, one
key thing does happen during

63
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,980
the interphase, and actually,
it happens during the same

64
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,390
thing, the S phase of
the interphase.

65
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,370
So if that's my cell, that's
my nucleus right here.

66
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,580
And I'm going to draw it as
chromosomes, but you have to

67
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,430
remember that when we're outside
of mitosis or meiosis

68
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,340
formally, the chromosomes are
all unwound, and they exist as

69
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,440
chromatin, which we've
talked about before.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,200
It's kind of the unwound
state of the DNA.

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,950
But I'm going to draw them wound
up because I need to

72
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,050
show you that they replicate.

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,750
Now, I'm going to be a
little careful here.

74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,290
In the mitosis video, I just
had two chromosomes.

75
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,350
They replicated and then
they split apart.

76
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,920
When we talk about meiosis, we
have to be careful to show the

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,670
homologous pairs.

78
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,100
So let's say that I have
two homologous pairs.

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,100
So let's say I have-- let me do
it in appropriate colors.

80
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,800
So this is the one I
got from my dad.

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,660
This is the one I
got from my mom.

82
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,470
They're homologous.

83
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,140
And let's say that I have
another one that

84
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,390
I got from my dad.

85
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,610

86
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,770
Let me do it in blue.

87
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,625
Actually, maybe I should do all
the ones from my dad in

88
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,900
this color.

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,570
Maybe it's a little
bit longer.

90
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,660
You get the idea.

91
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,269
And then a homologous one for
my mom that's also a little

92
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,589
bit longer.

93
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,019
Now, during the S phase of the
interphase-- and this is just

94
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,700
like what happens in mitosis,
so you can almost view it as

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,490
it always happens during
interphase.

96
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,810
It doesn't happen in either
meiosis or mitosis.

97
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,650
You have replication
of your DNA.

98
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,760
So each of these from the
homologous pair-- and

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,270
remember, homologous pairs
mean that they're not

100
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,900
identical chromosomes,
but they do code

101
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,040
for the same genes.

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,750
They might have different
versions or different alleles

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,430
for a gene or for a certain
trait, but they code

104
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,500
essentially for the same
kind of stuff.

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,870
Now, replication of these, so
each of these chromosomes in

106
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,580
this pair replicate.

107
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,690
So that one from my dad
replicates like this, it

108
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,690
replicates and it's connected
by a centromere, and the one

109
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,710
from my mom replicates like
that, and it's connected by a

110
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,010
centromere like that, and then
the other one does as well.

111
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,010
That's the shorter one.

112
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,260
Oh, that's the longer
one, actually.

113
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,110
That's the longer one.

114
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,220
I should be a little bit more
explicit in which one's

115
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,180
shorter and longer.

116
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,980
The one from my mom does
the same thing.

117
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,720
This is in the S phase
of interphase.

118
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,830
We haven't entered the actual
cell division yet.

119
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,320
And the same thing is true-- and
this is kind of a little

120
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,830
bit of a sideshow-- of
the centrosomes.

121
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,380
And we saw in the mitosis video
that these are involved

122
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,230
in kind of eventually creating
the microtubule structure in

123
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,560
pulling everything apart, but
you'll have one centrosome

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,450
that's hanging out here, and
then it facilitates its own

125
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,140
replication, so then you
have two centrosomes.

126
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,380
So this is all occurring
in the interphase, and

127
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,490
particularly in the S part
of the interphase,

128
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,950
not the growth part.

129
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,040
But once that's happens, we're
ready-- in fact, we're ready

130
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,405
for either mitosis or meiosis,
but we're going

131
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,280
to do meiosis now.

132
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,990
This is a germ cell.

133
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,120
So what happens is we enter
into prophase I.

134
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
So if you remember, in my-- let
me write this down because

135
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,550
I think it's important.

136
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:22,930
In mitosis you have prophase,
metaphase,

137
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,720
anaphase and telophase.

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,420
I won't keep writing
phase down.

139
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,940
PMAT.

140
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,420
In meiosis, you experience these
in each stage, so you

141
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,320
have to prophase I, followed
by metaphase I, followed by

142
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,010
anaphase I, followed
by telophase I.

143
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,720
Then after you've done meiosis
1, then it all happens again.

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,790
You have prophase II, followed
by metaphase II, followed by

145
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,490
anaphase II, followed
by telophase.

146
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,050
So if you really just want to
memorize the names, which you

147
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,670
unfortunately have to do in
this, especially if you're

148
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,830
going to get tested on it,
although it's not that

149
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,990
important to kind of understand
the concept of

150
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,410
what's happening, you just have
to remember prophase,

151
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,270
metaphase, anaphase, telophase,
and it'll really

152
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,150
cover everything.

153
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,480
You just after memorize in
meiosis, it's happening twice.

154
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,370
And what's happening is a little
bit different, and

155
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,930
that's what I really want
to focus on here.

156
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,260
So let's enter prophase
I of meiosis I.

157
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,590
So let me call this
prophase I.

158
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,210
So what's going to happen?

159
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,250
So just like in prophase and
mitosis, a couple of things

160
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,830
start happening.

161
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,725
Your nuclear envelope
starts disappearing.

162
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:42,680

163
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,180
The centromeres-- sorry,
not centromeres.

164
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm getting confused now.

165
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,420
The centrosomes.

166
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,750
The centromeres are these things
connecting these sister

167
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,140
chromatids.

168
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,680
The centrosomes start
facilitating the development

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,490
of the spindles, and they start
pushing apart a little

170
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,210
bit from the spindles.

171
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,830
They start pushing apart and
going to opposite sides of the

172
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,610
chromosomes.

173
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,280
And this is the really important
thing in prophase I.

174
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,630
And actually, I'll
make this point.

175
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,860
Remember, in interphase, even
though I drew it this way,

176
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,290
they don't exist in this state,
the actual chromosomes.

177
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,030
They exist more in a
chromatin state.

178
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,300
So if I were to really draw it,
it would look like this.

179
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,800
The chromosomes, it would all be
all over the place, and it

180
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,560
actually would be very difficult
to actually see it

181
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:29,990
in a microscope.

182
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,919
It would just be a big mess of
proteins and of histones,

183
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,650
which are proteins, and
the actual DNA.

184
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,140
And that's what's actually
referred to as the chromatin.

185
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,300
Now, in prophase, that starts to
form into the chromosomes.

186
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,170
It starts to have a little bit
of structure, and this is

187
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,710
completely analogous
to what happens

188
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,420
in prophase in mitosis.

189
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,000
Now, the one interesting thing
that happens is that the

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,320
homologous pairs line up.

191
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,420
And actually, I drew it like
that over here and maybe I

192
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,310
should just cut and paste it.

193
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,910
Let me just do that.

194
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:10,320
If I just cut and paste that,
although I said that the

195
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,455
nucleus is disappearing, so let
me get rid of the nucleus.

196
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:15,350
I already said that.

197
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,580
The nucleus is slowly
disassembling.

198
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,120
The proteins are coming apart
during this prophase I.

199
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,230
I won't draw the whole cell,
because what's interesting

200
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,730
here is happening at the
nuclear, or what once was the

201
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,320
nucleus level.

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,070
So the interesting thing here
that's different from mitosis

203
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,180
is that the homologous pairs
line up next to each other.

204
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,520
Not only do they line up, but
they can actually share-- they

205
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,880
can actually have genetic
recombination.

206
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,700
So you have these points where
analogous-- or I guess you

207
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,960
could say homologous-- points
on two of these chromosomes

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,240
will cross over each other.

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,660
So let me draw that in detail.

210
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,610
So let me just focus on maybe
these two right here.

211
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,950
So I have one chromosome from
my dad, and it's made up of

212
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,400
two chromatids, so it's already
replicated, but we

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,870
only consider it one chromosome,
and then I have

214
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,040
one from my mom in green.

215
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm going to draw
it like that.

216
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,370
One from my mom in green, and
it also has two chromatids.

217
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,570
Sometimes this is called a
tetrad because it has four

218
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,130
chromatids in it, but it's
in a pair of homologous

219
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,500
chromosomes.

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,750
These are the centromeres,
of course.

221
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,730
What happens is you have
crossing over, and it's a

222
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,770
surprisingly organized
process.

223
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,520
When I say organized,
it crosses over at

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,450
a homologous point.

225
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,450
It crosses over at a point
where, for the most part,

226
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,350
you're exchanging
similar genes.

227
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,690
It's not like one is getting two
versions of a gene and the

228
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,500
other is getting two versions
of another gene.

229
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,850
You're changing in a way that
both chromosomes are still

230
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,610
coding for the different genes,
but they're getting

231
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,670
different versions of those
genes or different alleles,

232
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,240
which are just versions
of those genes.

233
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,020
So once this is done, the ones
from my father are now not

234
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,880
completely from my father,
so it might look

235
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,140
something like this.

236
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,460
Let me see, it'll
look like this.

237
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,860
The one from my father now has
this little bit from my

238
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,480
mother, and the one from my--
oh, no, my mother's chromosome

239
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,000
is green-- a little bit from my
mother, and the one from my

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,360
mother has a little bit
from my father.

241
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
And this is really amazing
because it shows you that this

242
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,230
is so favorable for creating
variation in a population that

243
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,230
it has really become a formal
part of the meiosis process.

244
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,500
It happens so frequently.

245
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,120
This isn't just some random
fluke, and it happens in a

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,490
reasonably organized way.

247
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,840
It actually happens at a point
where it doesn't kind of

248
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,120
create junk genes.

249
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,670
Because you can imagine, this
cut-off point, which is called

250
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,690
a chiasma, it could have
happened in the middle of some

251
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,270
gene, and it could have created
some random noise, and

252
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,980
it could have broken down some
protein development in the

253
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,010
future or who knows what.

254
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,965
But it doesn't happen
that way.

255
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,360
It happens in a reasonably
organized way, which kind of

256
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,710
speaks to the idea that it's
part of the process.

257
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,970
So prophase in I, you also
have this happening.

258
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,210
So once that happens you could
have this guy's got a little

259
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,810
bit of that chromatid and then
this guy's got a little bit of

260
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,350
that chromatid.

261
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,700
So all of this stuff happens
in prophase I.

262
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,550
You have this crossing over.

263
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,890
The nuclear envelope starts to
disassemble, and then all of

264
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,460
these guys align and the
chromatin starts forming into

265
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,990
these more tightly wound
structures of chromosomes.

266
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,840
And really, that's all-- when
we talk about even mitosis,

267
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,000
that's where a lot of the action
really took place.

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,020
Once that happens, then we're
ready to enter into the

269
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,920
metaphase I, so let's go
down to metaphase I.

270
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,100
In metaphase I-- let me just
copy and paste what I've

271
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,710
already done-- the nuclear
envelope is now gone.

272
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,740

273
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,820
The centrosomes have
gone to opposite

274
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,130
sides of the cell itself.

275
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,010
Maybe I should draw the
entire cell now

276
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,030
that there's no nucleus.

277
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,090
Let me erase the nucleus
a little bit

278
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,990
better than I've done.

279
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,070
Let me erase all of that.

280
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,460
And, of course, we have the
spindles fibers that have been

281
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,750
generated by now with the
help of the centrosomes.

282
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,940
And some of them, as we learned,
this is exactly what

283
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,310
happened in mitosis.

284
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,290
They attach to the kinetochores,
which are

285
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,550
attached to the centromeres
of these chromosomes.

286
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,970
Now, what's interesting here is
that they each attach-- so

287
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,510
this guy's going to attach to--
and actually, let me do

288
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,950
something interesting here.

289
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,770
Instead of doing it this way,
because I want to show that

290
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,070
all my dad's chromosomes don't
go to one side and all my

291
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,760
mom's chromosomes don't
go to the other side.

292
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,000
So instead of drawing these two
guys like this, let me see

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,310
if I can flip them.

294
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,880
Let me see.

295
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,150
Let me just flip them
the other way.

296
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,560
Whether or not which direction
they're flipped is completely

297
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,500
random, and that's what
adds to the variation.

298
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,550
As we said before, sexual
reproduction is key to

299
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,610
introducing variation
into a population.

300
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,205
So that's the mom's and
that's the dad's.

301
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:28,790
They don't have to.

302
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,700
All of the ones from my dad
might have ended up on one

303
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,300
side and all of them from my mom
might end up on one side,

304
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,490
although when you're talking
about 23 pairs, the

305
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,720
probability becomes
a lot, lot lower.

306
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,560
So this is one from my dad.

307
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,930
Of course, it has some
centromeres.

308
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,790
Let me draw that there.

309
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,160
And so these microspindles,
some of them attach to

310
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
kinetochores, which are these
protein structures on the

311
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
centromeres.

312
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,100
And this is just
like metaphase.

313
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,050
It's very similar to metaphase
in mitosis.

314
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,160
This is called metaphase I,
and everything aligns.

315
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,410
Now we're going to
enter anaphase I.

316
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,050
Now, anaphase I is interesting,
because remember,

317
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,710
in mitosis in anaphase, the
actual chromatids, the sister

318
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,880
chromatids separated
from each other.

319
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,990
That's not the case in anaphase
I here in meiosis.

320
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,020
So when we enter anaphase I, you
have just the homologous

321
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,840
pairs separate, so the
chromatids stay with their

322
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,630
sister chromatids.

323
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,130
So on this side, you'll have
these to go there.

324
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,620
While I have the green out, let
me see if I can draw this

325
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,070
respectably.

326
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,780
I have the purple.

327
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,780
It's a little bit shorter
version here.

328
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,480
He's got a little bit of
a stub of green there.

329
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,180
This guy's got little stub
of purple there.

330
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,000
And then they have this longer
purple chromosome here.

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,510
This is anaphase I.

332
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,290
They're being pulled apart,
but they're being pulled

333
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,250
apart-- the homologous pair is
being pulled apart, not the

334
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,610
actual chromosomes, not
the chromatids.

335
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,230
So let me just draw this.

336
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,900
So then you have your
microtubules.

337
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,060
Some are connected to
these kinetochores.

338
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,310
You have your centromeres.

339
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,780

340
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,640
Of course, all of this is
occurring within the cell and

341
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,570
these are getting
pulled apart.

342
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,090
So it's analogous to anaphase
in mitosis, but the key

343
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,830
difference is you're pulling
apart homologous pairs.

344
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,070
You're not actually splitting
the chromosomes into their

345
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,240
constituent chromatids,
and that's key.

346
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,300
And if you forget that, you can
review the mitosis video.

347
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,840
So this is anaphase I.

348
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,400

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,060
And then as you could imagine,
telophase I is essentially

350
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:57,990
once these guys are at their
respective ends of the cell--

351
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,190
it's getting tiring redrawing
all of these, but I guess it

352
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,050
gives you time to let
it all sink in.

353
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,240
So these guys are now at the
left end of the cell and these

354
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,490
guys are now at the right
end of the cell.

355
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,099
Now, the microtubules start
to disassemble.

356
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,109
So maybe they're there a
little bit, but they're

357
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,800
disassembling.

358
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,170
You still have your centromeres
here and they're

359
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,380
at opposite poles.

360
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,339
And to some degree, in the
early part of telophase,

361
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,870
they're still pushing the cell
apart, and at the same time,

362
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,510
you have cytokinesis
happening.

363
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,030
So by the end of telophase I,
you have the actual cytoplasm

364
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,480
splitting during telophase right
there, and the nuclear

365
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,810
envelope is forming.

366
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,640
You can almost view it as the
opposite of prophase.

367
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,020

368
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,300
The nuclear envelope is forming,
and by the end of

369
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,530
telophase I, it will have
completely divided.

370
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,030
So this is telophase I.

371
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,710
Now, notice: we started off with
a diploid cell, right?

372
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,610
It had two pairs of homologous
chromosome, but it had four

373
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,310
chromosomes.

374
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,330
Now, each cell only has
two chromosomes.

375
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,790
Essentially, each cell got one
of the pair of each of those

376
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,960
homologous pairs, but it was
done randomly, and that's

377
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,690
where a lot of the variation
is introduced.

378
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,680
Now, once we're at this stage,
each of these cells now

379
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,320
undergo meiosis II,
which is actually

380
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,540
very similar to mitosis.

381
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,550
And sometimes, there's actually
an in-between stage

382
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,500
called interphase II, where
the cell kind of rests and

383
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,790
whatever else, and actually the
centromeres now have to

384
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,570
duplicate again.

385
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,610
So these two cells-- I've drawn
them separately-- let's

386
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,100
see what happens next.

387
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,420
So let's say that the
centromere-- actually, I

388
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,820
shouldn't have drawn the
centromere inside the

389
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,740
nucleus like that.

390
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,360
The centromere's going to be
outside the nucleus, outside

391
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,880
of the newly formed nucleus
there and there.

392
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
And then it'll actually
replicate itself at

393
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,450
this point as well.

394
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,700
So now we have two cells.

395
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,470

396
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:17,900
Let me just cut and paste what
I have. I have this one, this

397
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,380
chromosome right here.

398
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,650
It's got this little green stub
there and then I have

399
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,630
this longer fully green
chromosome there.

400
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:32,360
Now, this guy, he's got this
little purple stub here.

401
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,770
Let me draw this whole purple
chromosome there.

402
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,510
Then this guy has one chromatid
like that and one

403
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,370
chromatid like that.

404
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:47,060
Now, when we enter prophase
II, what do you

405
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,610
think is going to happen?

406
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,830
Well, just like before, you
have your nuclear envelope

407
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,090
that formed in telophase I.

408
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,830
It's kind of a temporary
thing.

409
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,470
It starts to disintegrate
again.

410
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:06,330

411
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,520
And then you have your
centromeres.

412
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,550
They start pushing apart so
now I had two centromeres.

413
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,290
They replicated, and now they
start pushing apart while they

414
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,260
generate their little
spindles.

415
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,840
They push apart in opposite
directions.

416
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,530
Now, this is happening in
two cells, of course.

417
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,290
They go in opposite directions
while they generate their

418
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,020
spindle fibers.

419
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,310
And let me make it very clear
that this is two cells we're

420
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,680
talking about.

421
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,180
That's one of them and that's
the second of them.

422
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:42,860
Now it's going to enter
metaphase II, which is

423
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,920
analogous to metaphase I, or
metaphase in mitosis, where

424
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,050
the chromosomes get lined up.

425
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,050
Let me draw it this way.

426
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,480
So now the centromeres, they've
migrated to the two

427
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,810
poles of the cell.

428
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,770
So those are my centromeres.

429
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,085
I have all of my spindles
fibers.

430
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:05,230

431
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,630
Oh, sorry, did I call
those centromeres?

432
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,880
The centrosomes.

433
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,190

434
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,655
I don't know how long I've been
calling them centromeres.

435
00:21:11,655 --> 00:21:14,830
These are centrosomes, and my
brain keeps confusing them.

436
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,360
The centromeres, and maybe
this'll help you not do what I

437
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,520
just did, the centromeres are
the things that are connecting

438
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,090
the two sister chromatids.

439
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,070
Those are centromeres.

440
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,810
Centrosomes are the things that
are pushing back the--

441
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,450
that generate the
spindle fibers.

442
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,500
The chromosomes line up
during metaphase.

443
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,200
Metaphase always involves the
lining up of chromosomes so

444
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,790
that one-- let me
just draw it.

445
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,790
So I have that and that.

446
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,820
This one's got a purple
guy, too.

447
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,920
This guy's got a purple guy,
a long purple guy, and then

448
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,880
there's a little stub
for the other guy.

449
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,410
This guy's got a long green
guy and this guy's got a

450
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,540
little green stub, and then this
is the short green guy

451
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,220
right there.

452
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,650
And, of course, they're
being aligned.

453
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,270
Some of these spindle fibers
have been attached to the

454
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,360
centromeres or the kinetochores
that are on the

455
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,460
centromeres that connect these
two chromatids, these sister

456
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,650
chromatids.

457
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,820
And, of course, we don't have
a nuclear membrane anymore,

458
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,830
and these are, of course,
two separate cells.

459
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,740
And then you can guess what
happens in anaphase II.

460
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,970
It's just like anaphase
in mitosis.

461
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,210

462
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,340
These things get pulled apart
by the kinetochore

463
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,190
microtubules, while the other
microtubules keep growing and

464
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,140
push and these two things
further apart.

465
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,480
So let me show that.

466
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,530
And they the key here: this
is the difference between

467
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,970
anaphase II and anaphase I.

468
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,960
Anaphase I, the homologous pairs
were broken up, but the

469
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,290
chromosomes themselves
were not.

470
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,120
Now, in anaphase II, we don't
have homologous pairs.

471
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,280
We just have chromatid pairs,
sister chromatids.

472
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,910
Now, those are separated,
which is very similar to

473
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,080
anaphase in mitosis.

474
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,200
So now, this guy gets pulled in
that direction so it look

475
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,940
something like this.

476
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,830
The drawing here is the hardest
part of this video.

477
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,200
So that guy gets pulled there.

478
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,570
That guy's getting pulled
in that direction.

479
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,840
He's got that little
green stub on him.

480
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,470
And then you have one green
guy getting pulled in that

481
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,210
direction with the longer
chromosome.

482
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,220
And then one of the other longer
is getting pulled in

483
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,190
that direction, and it's all
by these microtubules

484
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,670
connected at the kinetochore
structures by a centrosome as

485
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,850
kind of the coordinating body.

486
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,350
It's all being pulled apart.

487
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,850
Anaphase has always involved
the pulling apart of the

488
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,440
chromosomes or pulling
apart of something.

489
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,300
Let me put it that way.

490
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,110
And it's happening on this
side of the cell as well.

491
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,830
Of course, this is
all one cell.

492
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,480
And just like in mitosis, as
soon as the sister chromatids

493
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,450
are split apart, they are now
referred to as chromosomes, or

494
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,910
sister chromosomes.

495
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,530
And, of course, this
is happening twice.

496
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,690
This is also happening
in the other cell.

497
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,010
The other cell's a little
bit cleaner.

498
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,730
It didn't have that
crossover occur.

499
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,900
So you have the longer
purple one.

500
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,600
He gets split up into two
chromatids, which we are now

501
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,820
calling chromosomes, or
sister chromosomes.

502
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,530
And then this guy up here, he
gets split up into this short

503
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,270
green, and then there's a-- let
me do it this way-- this

504
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,820
short green, and he's
got a little purple

505
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,490
stub on it right there.

506
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,090
And, of course, it's all being
pulled away by the same idea,

507
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,885
by the centrosomes.

508
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,700
I want to make sure I
get that word right.

509
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,320
I'm afraid whether I used
centromeres for the whole

510
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,110
first part of the video, but
hopefully, my confusion will

511
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,540
help you from getting confused
because you'll realize that

512
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,590
it's a pitfall to fall into.

513
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,380
So that's anaphase.

514
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,790
Everything is getting
pulled apart.

515
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,810
And then you can imagine
what telophase II is.

516
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,040
In fact, I won't
even redraw it.

517
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,010
Telophase II, these things get
pulled apart even more, so

518
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,170
this is telophase II.

519
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,420
They get pulled apart
even more.

520
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,180
The cell elongates.

521
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:09,180
You start having this cleavage
occur right here.

522
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,350
So at the same time that in
telophase II these get pulled

523
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,560
part, you have the
cytokinesis.

524
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,440
The tubules start disintegrating
and then you

525
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,880
have a nucleus that forms
around these.

526
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,720
So what is the end result
of all of these?

527
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,280
Well, that guy's going to turn
into a nucleus that has this

528
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,590
purple dude with a little green
stub, and then a long

529
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,460
green guy, and then he's got
his nuclear membrane.

530
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,620
And, of course, there's the
entire cytoplasm in the rest

531
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,300
of the cell.

532
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,280
The other person that was his
kind of partner in this

533
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,180
meiosis II, he's going
to have a short

534
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,980
purple and a long green.

535
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,610
He has a nuclear membrane,
and, of course, it has

536
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,340
cytoplasm around it.

537
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,730
And then on this side, you have

538
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,955
something similar happening.

539
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:10,300
You see this first guy, this
first one right here has two

540
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,840
long purple ones.

541
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,080
They get separated.

542
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,880
So let me see, you have one long
purple in that cell and

543
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,670
you have another long
purple in this cell.

544
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,780
In that top one, you have a
short green one, and in this

545
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,260
bottom, you have a short green
one that had got a little bit

546
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,960
of one of my dad's-- a
homologous part of one of my

547
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,520
dad's chromosomes on it.

548
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,740
And, of course, these also
have nuclear membranes,

549
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,630
nuclear membranes, and, of
course, it has a cytoplasm in

550
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,900
the rest of the cell, which
we'll learn more about all

551
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,110
those other things.

552
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,900
So what we see here is that we
went from a diploid starting

553
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,530
way-- where did we start?

554
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,890
We started up here with a
diploid germ cell, and we went

555
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,820
through two stages
of division.

556
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,220
The first stage split up
homologous pairs, but it

557
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,590
started over with that crossing
over, that genetic

558
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,380
combination, which is a key
feature of meiosis, which adds

559
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,620
a lot a variation to a species
or to a gene pool.

560
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,080
And then the second phase
separated the sister

561
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,950
chromatids, just like what
happens in mitosis.

562
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,980
And we end up with four haploid
cells because they

563
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,750
have half the contingency of
chromosomes, and these are

564
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,000
called gametes.

565
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,499

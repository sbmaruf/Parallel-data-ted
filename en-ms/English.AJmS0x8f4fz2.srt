1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,366
Welcome to the presentation

2
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:05,066
on adding and subtracting negative numbers.

3
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,380
So let's get started.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,510
So what is a negative number, first of all?

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,080
Well, let me draw a number line.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,295
Well it's not much of a line,

7
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:15,190
but I think you'll get the picture.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,797
So we're used to the positive numbers, so if that's 0

9
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:24,670
you have one, you have 2, you have 3, you have 4

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,686
and you keep going.

11
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,548
And if I were to say what's 2+2

12
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,780
you'd start at 2, and then you'd add 2

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,460
you'd get to 4.

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,140
I mean most of us it's second nature.

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,930
But if you actually drew it on a number line,

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,130
you'd say 2+2=4

17
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,490
And if I asked you what's 2-1

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,840
or let's say what's 3-2

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,111
If you start at 3 and you subtracted 2

20
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,658
you would end up at 1

21
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:51,248
That's 2+2=4, and 3-2=1

22
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:52,980
And this is a joke for you.

23
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,990
Now what if I were to say what is 1-3?

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,150
Huh.

25
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,100
Well, it's the same thing.

26
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,847
You start at 1 and we're going to go 1--

27
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,960
well, now we're going to go below 0

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,730
what happens below 0?

29
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,500
Well then you start going to the negative numbers.

30
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,930
-1, -2, -3, and so on.

31
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,909
So if I start at 1 right here, so 1-3

32
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,610
so I go 1,2,3, I end up at -2

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,680
So 1-3=-2

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,080
This is something that you're probably already doing

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,729
in your everyday life

36
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,137
If I were to tell you that

37
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,225
boy, it's very cold today, it's one degree,

38
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,728
but tomorrow it's going to be three degrees colder,

39
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:42,038
you might already know intuitively,

40
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,502
well then we're going to be

41
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:46,925
at a temperature of negative two degrees.

42
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,040
So that's all a negative number means.

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,132
And just remember when a negative number is big,

44
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:58,090
so like -50, that's actually colder than -20, right?

45
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,710
So a -50 is actually even a smaller number than -20

46
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,926
because it's even further to the left of -20

47
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,160
That's just something you'll get an intuitive feel for.

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,708
Sometimes when you start you feel like

49
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,185
oh, 50 is a bigger number than 20

50
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:13,860
but it's a -50 as opposed to a 50

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,306
So let's do some problems,

52
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:19,270
and I'm going to keep using the number line

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,415
because I think it's useful

54
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:26,872
So let's do the problem 5-12

55
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,785
I think you already might have an intuition

56
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:34,195
of what this equals.

57
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:45,144
But let me draw a line, 5-12

58
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:53,068
So let me start with -10, -9, -8--

59
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:58,780
I think I'm going to run out of space-- -7, -6, -5

60
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,155
I should have this pre-drawn -- -4, -3, -2, -1

61
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:12,537
0,1,2,3,4, and I'll put 5 right here.

62
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,494
I'm gonna push this arrow out a little bit. Okay.

63
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,548
5-12

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,430
So if we start at 5-- let me use a different color--

65
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,945
we start at 5 right here and we're going to go to the left 12

66
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,805
because we're subtracting 12

67
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:33,870
So then we go 1,2,3...

68
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,262
Negative 7

69
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:39,993
That's pretty interesting.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,789
Because it also happens to be

71
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,580
that 12 - 5 = +7

72
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,900
So, I want you to think a little bit about why that is.

73
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,939
Why the difference between 12 and 5 is 7,

74
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:58,918
and the difference between

75
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:00,038
-- well, I guess it's either way.

76
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,097
In this situation we're also saying

77
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:03,812
that the difference between 5 and 12 is -7,

78
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,162
but the numbers are that far apart,

79
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,496
but now we're starting with the lower number.

80
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,538
I think that last sentence just completely confused you,

81
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,789
but we'll keep moving forward.

82
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:18,060
We just said 5-12=-7

83
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,434
Let's do another one.

84
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:25,843
What's -3+5?

85
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,050
Well, let's use the same number line.

86
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,490
Let's go to -3 plus 5

87
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,580
So we're going to go to the right 5

88
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,425
One, two, three, four, five.

89
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:42,602
It's a two.

90
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,363
It equals two.

91
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:48,790
So -3 + 5 = 2

92
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,843
That's interesting because 5 - 3 is also equal to 2

93
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:57,007
Well, it turns out that 5 - 3 is the same thing,

94
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,252
it's just another way of writing 5 plus -3

95
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:04,050
or -3 plus 5

96
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,052
A general, easy way to always do negative numbers

97
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:11,640
is it's just like regular addition and subtraction,

98
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,456
but now when we subtract

99
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:18,634
we can go to the left below zero

100
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:19,826
Let's do another one.

101
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:21,587
So what happens when you get

102
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:27,111
let's say, 2 minus -3?

103
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:30,747
Well, if you think about how it should work out,

104
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,079
I think this will make sense.

105
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,135
But it turns out that the negative number,

106
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:36,140
the negative signs actually cancel out.

107
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,425
So this is the same thing as 2 plus +3

108
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,050
and that just equals 5

109
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,305
Another way you could say is-- let's do another one--

110
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:52,866
what is -7 minus -2?

111
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:58,010
Well that's the same thing as -7 + 2

112
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,144
And remember, so we're doing to start at -7

113
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:03,560
and we're going to move 2 to the right.

114
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,224
So if we move 1 to the right we go to -6

115
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:11,392
and then we move 2 to the right we get -5

116
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,755
That makes sense because -7 + 2

117
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,540
that's the same thing as 2 - 7

118
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,351
If it's two degrees and

119
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:22,475
it gets seven degrees colder, it's -5

120
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:23,230
Let's do a bunch of these.

121
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,253
I think the more you do, the more practice you have,

122
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,847
and the modules explain it pretty well.

123
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:29,056
Probably better than I do.

124
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,104
So let's just do a ton of problems.

125
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:36,473
So if I said -7 - 3

126
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:39,396
Well, now we're going to go 3 to the left of -7

127
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,386
We're going to get 3 less than -7

128
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:45,420
so that's -10, right?

129
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,055
That makes sense, because if we had 7 + 3

130
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,762
we're at 7 to the right of 0

131
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:52,504
and we're going to go 3 more to the right of 0

132
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:54,538
and we get positive 10

133
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,385
So for 7 to the left of 0 and go 3 more to the left,

134
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,680
we're going to get -10

135
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,460
Let's do a bunch more.

136
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,048
I know I'm probably confusing you,

137
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:04,218
but practice is what's going to really help us.

138
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:09,118
So let's say 3 minus -3

139
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:12,360
well, these negatives cancel out,

140
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,570
so that just equals 6

141
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,088
What's 3-3?

142
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,687
Well, 3-3, that's easy.

143
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,687
That's just 0

144
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,980
What's -3 nimus 3?

145
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,420
Well now we're going to get 3 less than -3

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,880
well that's -6

147
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,030
What's -3 minus -3

148
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,500
Interesting.

149
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,790
Well, the minuses cancel out, so you get -3 plus 3

150
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,028
Well, if we start 3 to the left of 0 and we move 3 to the right,

151
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,060
we end up at 0 again.

152
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,240
So that makes sense, right?

153
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,360
Let me do that again.

154
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,290
-3 minus -3

155
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,390
Anything minus itself should equal 0, right?

156
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,950
That's why that equals 0

157
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,868
And that's why it makes sense that

158
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:03,183
those two negatives cancel out

159
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,498
and that's the same thing as this.

160
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,429
Let's do a bunch more.

161
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:12,140
Let's do 12 - 13

162
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,610
That's pretty easy.

163
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,940
Well, 12 - 12 = 0, so12 - 13 = -1

164
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,920
because we're going to go 1 the left of 0

165
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,670
Let's do 8 - 5

166
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,270
Well, this one is just a normal problem, that's 3

167
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,640
What's 5 - 8?

168
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,988
Well, we're going to go all the way to 0

169
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:35,420
and then 3 more to the left of 0, so it's -3

170
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,500
I could draw a number line here.

171
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,468
If this is 0, this is 5

172
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:47,233
and now we're going to go to left 8,

173
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,290
then we end up at -3

174
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,400
You could do that for all of these.

175
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,770
That actually might be a good exercise.

176
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,113
I think this will give you good introduction

177
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,220
and I recommend that you just do the modules,

178
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,281
because the modules actually

179
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:58,977
especially if you do the hints

180
00:08:58,977 --> 00:08:59,673
it has a pretty nice graphic

181
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,578
that's a lot nicer than

182
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:03,990
anything I could draw on this chalkboard.

183
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,463
So, try that out

184
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,494
and I'm going to try to record some more modules

185
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:09,140
that hopefully won't confuse you as badly.

186
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,533
You could also attend the seminar

187
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,700
on adding and subtracting negative numbers.

188
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,160
I hope you have fun!

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,460
Bye.

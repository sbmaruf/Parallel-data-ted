1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,950
We're on problem 31.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,280
A sewing club is making a
quilt consisting of 25

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,650
squares, with each side of
the square measuring 30

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,240
centimeters.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,000
OK, and there's going
to be 25 of these.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,260
And they're going
to be 30 by 30.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,580
If the quilt has 5 rows and 5
columns, what is the perimeter

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,560
of the quilt?

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,190
OK, so let me draw that out.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,865
So it has 5 rows and 5 columns
and they're all squares.

11
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:31,005
So the quilt itself is
going to be a square.

12
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:39,050
It has 4 rows, one two, three,
four, and then five.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,490
And then one, two,
three, four.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,230
So that's a 5 by 5.

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,970
And each of these squares,
their sides are 30

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,030
centimeters.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,120
So how long is one side of
this quilt going to be?

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,280
It's going to be 30 times 5.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,800
So it's going to be
150 centimeters.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,446
Same argument, that's going
to be 150 centimeters.

21
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:06,410
And that's going to be
150 centimeters.

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,230
30 times 5.

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,520
And this is going to
be 150 centimeters.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,260
So the perimeter is 150 plus
150 plus 150 plus 150 and

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,280
that's 600.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,590
So that's choice C.

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,330
32.

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,370
The four sides of this figure
will be folded up and taped to

29
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,520
make a box.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,530
Fair enough.

31
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,010
What will be the volume
of the box?

32
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,790
OK, so if we cut this out right
now and we folded it

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,100
along where I'm drawing these
green lines, we'll get a box.

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,870
And they want to say,
what's the volume?

35
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,720
Well, volume is just
the base times the

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,200
height times the depth.

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,150
So if I were to fold up this
box is going to look

38
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,580
something like this.

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,210
You're going to have the base,
which is this base right here.

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,970
And this is one, one, two,
three, four, five by one, two,

41
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,370
three, four, five.

42
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,660
So it's 5 by 5 base.

43
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,470
And then each of the sides are
going to be 2 high if I fold

44
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,440
this up, it's going to
be 2 high like that.

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,910
It's going to look like that
if I folded that side up.

46
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,140
This side, when I fold it up,
is going to look like this.

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,340
One, two, three, four, five.

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,860
That's side when I fold it is
going to look like that.

49
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,700
And this side when I fold it up
is going to look like that.

50
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,230
One, two, three, four, five.

51
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,250
The big picture, the width is
5, the depth is 5, and the

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,360
height is 2.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,330
So the volume is 5 times
5 is 25 times 2.

54
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,470
Which is equal to 50.

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,230
And that's choice A.

56
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,070
Problem 33.

57
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,650
Where's 33, I think it's
on the next page.

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,210
OK, let me copy and paste it.

59
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,120
I should just copy and
paste the whole test.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,020
OK, it says a classroom globe
has a diameter of 18 inches.

61
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,080
If I were to go from
the center to the

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,700
side, it's 18 inches.

63
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,090
Which of the following is the
approximate surface area.

64
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,590
Oh no, sorry, I just
drew the radius.

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,280
It has a diameter
of 18 inches.

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,490
This is 18.

67
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,760
Which of the following is an
approximate surface area in

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,480
square inches of the globe?

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,520
And surface area, they give us
the equation, they give it in

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,650
terms of the radius.

71
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,210
So if the diameter is 18,
what's the radius?

72
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,460
The radius is half
of the diameter.

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,050
So the radius is equal to 9.

74
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,580
And we just plug
that into here.

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,140
So the surface area is equal
to 4 pi times the radius

76
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,420
squared, times 9 squared.

77
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,110
That equals 4 times
81 times pi.

78
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,010
So it's 324 pi.

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,350
And they actually multiplied
it out.

80
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,810
So let's see.

81
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:01,620
Let's see, 324 pi.

82
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,320
And if I were to guess this, I
mean, look at all the choices.

83
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,470
Pi is more than 3.

84
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,820
So this value is going to be
more than 3 times 324.

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,230
So it's going to be around 1,000
or a little bit more

86
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,160
than 1,000.

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,240
And the only one that's even
close to that is D.

88
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,070
But if you wanted to confirm
that, you could multiply 324

89
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:35,010
times 3.14 and that is
equal to 1,017.4.

90
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,030
All right, next problem.

91
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,830
Problem 34.

92
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:52,480
I'll copy and paste 34 and
35 at the same time.

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,270
There you go.

94
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,520
I put this there.

95
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,720
All right, ready to do it.

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,750
The rectangle shown below has
a length of 20 meters and

97
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,460
width of 10.

98
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,380
So this is 10 and this is 20.

99
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,100
I just picked that because this
looks longer than that.

100
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,600
That's a 10 I drew.

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,200
I know it doesn't
look like a 10.

102
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,490
If the four triangles are
removed from the rectangle as

103
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,000
shown, what will be the area
of the remaining figure?

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,320
So what's the are before
I remove them?

105
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,980
It's 20 times 10.

106
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,910
That's the area of the
whole rectangle.

107
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,390
So it's 200.

108
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,270
And then how much area
am I removing?

109
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,130
So each of these triangles,
what's its area?

110
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,810
It's base times height
times 1/2.

111
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,920
That's the area of a triangle.

112
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,400
Because if you just did base
times height, you'd be

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,040
figuring out the area of this
little rectangle there.

114
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,200
So the area of this is 4 times 4
is 16 times 1/2, which is 8.

115
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,400
This is going to be 8, going
to be 8, going to be 8.

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
So we're removing four
8's from this area.

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
So we're removing 32.

118
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,410
So minus 32.

119
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,710
And that's 168.

120
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,095
So that's choice C.

121
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,880
Problem 35.

122
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:14,780
If RSTW is a rhombus, so rhombus
tells us that all the

123
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,960
sides are equal and
they're parallel.

124
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,450
What is the area of WXT.

125
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,740
So this right here.

126
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,250
OK, so this is something that
you may or may not have

127
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,960
learned about a rhombus
already.

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,580
But its diagonals actually
intersect at a

129
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,210
perpendicular line.

130
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,740
And let me see what
else we can see.

131
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,020
This is 60 degrees, so
this is 30 degrees.

132
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,990
Let's see what we can
get from this.

133
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,300
This is 12.

134
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,540
Then this is 12.

135
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,680
OK, I see where they're
going with this.

136
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,740
So if this is 90 degrees,
this is 90 degrees.

137
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,280
This is a rhombus, so all
the sides are the same.

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,370
If this is 60, this is 90, this
has to be 30 degrees.

139
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,320
And then you could actually make
a very strong argument

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,650
that these are similar
triangles.

141
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,300
Whatever length this is,
that's the same length,

142
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,860
because this is a parallelogram
and the

143
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,350
diagonals bisect each other.

144
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,710
This side is equal
to that side.

145
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,730
That side is equal
to this side.

146
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,220
So these are congruent
triangles.

147
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,450
So this is also going
to be 60 degrees.

148
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,590
This is going to be 30.

149
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,400
But if you have a 60, let me do
it in another color, if you

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,720
have a 60, 60, 60 triangle,
all of the angles are 60

151
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,560
degrees, you're dealing with
an equilateral triangle.

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,960
So that tells you that all
the sides are the same.

153
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,580
So if this side is 12, that side
is 12, this side right

154
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,650
here also has to be 12.

155
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,280
If that whole side is 12,
what's this length?

156
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,320
We already know that in a
parallelogram the diagonals

157
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,220
bisect each other.

158
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,820
So this length is 6.

159
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,330
And this length is 6.

160
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,750
Fair enough.

161
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,430
And let's see, if each of these
lengths are 6, can we

162
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,850
figure out what this
height is equal to?

163
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,790
Because if we know the base and
the height, we're ready to

164
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,390
figure out the area
of a triangle.

165
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,820
So let's see if we can use
the Pythagorean Theorem.

166
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,950
If we called this x, we could
say x squared plus 6 squared

167
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,490
plus 36 is equal to 12 squared,
is equal to 144.

168
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,580
And we you could say that x
squared is equal to, what's

169
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:52,200
144 minus 36, that's 108.

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,660
Let's see, 108.

171
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,882
x squared is equal to 108.

172
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:01,750
x is equal to the square
root of 108.

173
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,430
And I can simplify that
more because 9

174
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,680
goes into 108 12 times.

175
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,210
Let me do that.

176
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,240
So x is equal to the
square root of 9

177
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,250
times 12, that's 108.

178
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,900
So that's equal to the square
root of 9 times the square

179
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,380
root of 12.

180
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,190
That's equal to 3 times
the square root of 12.

181
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,030
Square root of 12 is the same
thing as the square root of 3

182
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,640
times the square root of 4.

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,720
Square root of 4 is 2.

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,830
So that's 2 times 3 is
6 square root of 3.

185
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,260
This is 36 times 3.

186
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,870
We could have said this is equal
to the square root of 36

187
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,210
times the square root of 3.

188
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,360
All right, so 6 square
roots of 3.

189
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,510
That's this side.

190
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,940
So what's the area of this
triangle right there?

191
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,280
It's 1/2 times this base times
6 times 6 square roots of 3.

192
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,040
So that's 1/2 times 6 is 3,
times, 6 square roots of 3 is

193
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,170
18 square roots of 3.

194
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,280
Now that's just this triangle.

195
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,970
This triangle is congruent to
this triangle, so it will have

196
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,450
the same area.

197
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,100
And you can make the same
argument that all of these

198
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,440
triangles are congruent.

199
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,176
So the area of this entire
rhombus is going

200
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,530
to be 4 times this.

201
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,540
Is that what they wanted?

202
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,930
Oh no, they wanted of
the area of WXD.

203
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what we just
figured out.

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,250
They didn't want the area
of the whole rhombus.

205
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,880
They want just the area of this
triangle right there,

206
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,170
which we just figured out, which
is 18 square roots of 3.

207
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,060
I'm trying to think if there's
a simpler way of doing this.

208
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,510
There might be some formula for
the equation for the area

209
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,790
of a rhombus that I've forgotten
in my memory.

210
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,120
But we were able
to re-prove it.

211
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,770
And that's always better, to
come from basic principles.

212
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,220
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

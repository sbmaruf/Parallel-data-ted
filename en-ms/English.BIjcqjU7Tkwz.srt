1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For years I've been feeling frustrated,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
because as a religious historian,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've become acutely aware

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of the centrality of compassion

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in all the major world faiths.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Every single one of them

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
has evolved their own version

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of what's been called the Golden Rule.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And equally important

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is the negative version --

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Look into your own heart,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
discover what it is that gives you pain

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to inflict that pain on anybody else.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
not just because it sounds good,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but because it works.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
People have found that when they have

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
implemented the Golden Rule

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
as Confucius said, "all day and every day,"

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and then returning to a life of greed

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and egotism,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but to do it all day and every day,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
put another there, and you transcend yourself.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And it brings you into the presence

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Something that goes beyond

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
what we know in our ego-bound existence.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that this was so central to the religious life.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because with a few wonderful exceptions,

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
very often when religious people come together,

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
or uttering a council of hatred

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I sometimes see

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
because people often want to be right instead.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now why was I so grateful to TED?

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because they took me very gently

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
from my book-lined study

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and brought me into the 21st century,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
than I could have ever conceived.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because I feel an urgency about this.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If we don't manage to implement

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the Golden Rule globally,

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
as though they were as important as ourselves,

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I doubt that we'll have

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The task of our time,

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
one of the great tasks of our time,

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is to build a global society, as I said,

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
where people can live together in peace.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And the religions that should be making a major contribution

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
are instead seen as part of the problem.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is the source of all morality,

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
this imaginative act of empathy,

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
putting yourself in the place of another.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
or we can go back to

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
who, when asked by a pagan

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
any interpretation of scripture

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And we need to revive that spirit.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And it's not just going to happen

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
because a spirit of love wafts us down.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We have to make this happen,

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and we can do it

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
with the modern communications

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that TED has introduced.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Already I've been tremendously heartened

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
at the response of all our partners.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In Singapore, we have a group

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
going to use the Charter to heal divisions

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and some members of the parliament want

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to implement it politically.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
in which leading artists are going to be

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
taking people, young people,

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and showing them that compassion also lies

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
at the root of all art.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
are holding events and discussions,

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
are discussing the centrality of compassion

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
in Islam and in all faiths.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Religious teaching must always lead to action.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I want to continue with our partners

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to do two things --

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Education because we've so

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
dropped out of compassion.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
People often think it simply means

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
feeling sorry for somebody.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But of course you don't understand compassion

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
if you're just going to think about it.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You also have to do it.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want them to get the media involved

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because the media are crucial

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
we have of other people,

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
which are dividing us from one another.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The same applies to educators.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'd like youth to get a sense of

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
of a compassionate lifestyle.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And also see that it demands acute intelligence,

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
not just a gooey feeling.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the compassionate theme

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in their own and in other people's traditions.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And perhaps above all,

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to encourage a sensitivity about

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
uncompassionate speaking,

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
so that because people have this Charter,

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
whatever their beliefs or lack of them,

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
they feel empowered

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to challenge uncompassionate speech,

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
disdainful remarks

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
from their religious leaders, their political leaders,

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
from the captains of industry.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because we can change the world,

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we have the ability.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was still stuck in the old world

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and issuing yet another arcane statement.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And TED introduced me to a whole new way

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
of thinking and presenting ideas.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
In this room, all this expertise,

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
if we joined it all together,

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
we could change the world.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
whom I don't quote very often,

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
C.S. Lewis.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's in his book "The Four Loves."

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He said that he distinguished between erotic love,

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then he compared that to friendship,

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
with their eyes fixed on a common goal.

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We don't have to fall in love with each other,

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but we can become friends.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I am convinced.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I felt it very strongly

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
during our little deliberations at Vevey,

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that when people of all different persuasions

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
come together, working side by side

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
for a common goal,

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
differences melt away.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And we learn amity.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you very much.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
(Applause)

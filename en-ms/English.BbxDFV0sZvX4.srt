1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,750
Let's say I have an
angle ABC, and it

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,400
looks something like this.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,670
So its vertex is going
to be at B. Maybe

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,890
A sits right over here, and
C sits right over there.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:22,620
And then also let's say that we
have another angle called DBA.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,210
I want to have the vertex
once again at B. So let's

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,420
say it looks like this.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,200
So this right over here is our
point D. That is our point D.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,000
And let's say that we know
that the measure of angle DBA

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,010
is equal to 40 degrees.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,050
So this angle right
over here, its measure

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,340
is equal to 40 degrees.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,160
And let's say that we know
that the measure of angle ABC

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,635
is equal to 50 degrees.

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,447

17
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,530
So there's a bunch of
interesting things happening

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,060
here.

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,220
The first interesting thing
that you might realize

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,360
is that both of these
angles share a side.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,230
If you view these as rays-- they
could be lines, line segments,

22
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,210
or rays-- but if you
view them as rays,

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,320
they both share this ray BA.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,380
And when you have
two angles like this

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,900
that share the same side, these
are called adjacent angles.

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,650
Because the word "adjacent"
literally means next to.

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,910
These are adjacent.

28
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,342
They are adjacent angles.

29
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:27,800
Now there's something
else that you

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,380
might notice that's
interesting here.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,770
We know that the measure
of angle DBA is 40 degrees

32
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,540
and the measure of
angle ABC is 50 degrees.

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,351
And you might be able to guess
what the measure of angle DBC

34
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:40,850
is.

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,000

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,029
If we drew a
protractor over here--

37
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:47,070
I'm not going to draw it.

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,270
It will make my
drawing all messy.

39
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,089
Well, maybe I'll
draw it really fast.

40
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:52,880
So if you had a protractor
right over here,

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,190
clearly this is opening
up to 50 degrees.

42
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,290
And this is going
another 40 degrees.

43
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,820
So if you wanted to say what
the measure of angle DBC is,

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,982
it would essentially be the sum
of 40 degrees and 50 degrees.

45
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:06,440
And let me delete
all of this stuff

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,773
right here to keep things clean.

47
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:13,260
So the measure of angle DBC
would be equal to 90 degrees.

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,010
And we already know that 90
degrees is a special angle.

49
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,325
This is a right angle.

50
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:22,180

51
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,810
There's also a word for
two angles whose sum add up

52
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,860
to 90 degrees, and
that is complementary.

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:38,900
So we can also say that
angles DBA and angles

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
ABC are complementary.

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,400

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,490
And that is because their
measures add up to 90 degrees.

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,300
So the measure of angle DBA
plus the measure of angle ABC

58
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,410
is equal to 90 degrees.

59
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,300
They form a right angle
when you add them up.

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,140
And just as another
point of terminology

61
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,710
that's kind of related
to right angles,

62
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,550
when a right angle is
formed, the two rays

63
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,936
that form the right angle
or the two lines that

64
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,060
form that right angle or
the two line segments that

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,570
form that right angle
are called perpendicular.

66
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,420
So because we know that measure
of angle DBC is 90 degrees

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,600
or that angle DBC is a
right angle, this tells us,

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:36,130
we know that the
line segment DB is

69
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:46,650
perpendicular to
line segment BC.

70
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,790
Or we could even say ray BD
is-- instead of using the word

71
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,822
perpendicular, there's
sometimes this symbol

72
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,030
right here, which really
just shows two perpendicular

73
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,890
lines-- perpendicular to BC.

74
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,040
So all of these are
true statements here.

75
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,000
And these come out of
the fact that the angle

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,320
formed between DB and BC,
that is a 90-degree angle.

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,970
Now, we have other words
when our two angles add up

78
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,110
to other things.

79
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,740
So let's say, for example,
I have one angle over here.

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:31,240

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,780
Let me put some letters
here so we can specify it.

82
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,470
So let's say this
is X, Y, and Z.

83
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,470
And let's say that the
measure of angle XYZ

84
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,250
is equal to 60 degrees.

85
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,920
And let's say that you
have another angle that

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,650
looks like this.

87
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,570

88
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,824
And I'll call this,
let's say, maybe MNO.

89
00:04:56,824 --> 00:05:02,240

90
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,330
And let's say that the measure
of angle MNO is 120 degrees.

91
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,160
So if you were to add the two
measures of these-- so let

92
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
me write this down.

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:25,770
The measure of angle MNO plus
the measure of angle XYZ,

94
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,430
this is going to be equal to 120
degrees plus 60 degrees, which

95
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,930
is equal to 180 degrees.

96
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,110
So if you add these
two things up,

97
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,270
you essentially are able to go
all halfway around the circle.

98
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,470
Or you could go throughout
the entire half circle

99
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,720
or semicircle for a protractor.

100
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,260
And when you have two angles
that add up to 180 degrees,

101
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,250
we call them supplementary.

102
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,450
I know it's a little hard
to remember sometimes.

103
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,960
90 degrees is complementary.

104
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,670
They're just
complementing each other.

105
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,750
And then if you add
up to 180 degrees,

106
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,690
you have supplementary.

107
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,315
You have supplementary angles.

108
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:03,630

109
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,700
And if you have two
supplementary angles that

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,850
are adjacent so that they
share a common side-- so let

111
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,990
me draw that over here.

112
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,760
So let's say you have one
angle that looks like this.

113
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,620
And that you have another angle.

114
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,290
So let me put some
letters here again.

115
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,890
And I'll start reusing letters.

116
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,500
So let's say that this is ABC.

117
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,820

118
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
And you have another angle
that looks like this.

119
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,270

120
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,570
I already used C.

121
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,820
Once again, let's say
that this is 50 degrees.

122
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,950
And let's say that this right
over here is 130 degrees.

123
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:49,120
Clearly, angle DBA plus angle
ABC, if you add them together,

124
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
you get 130 degrees plus 50
degrees, which is 180 degrees.

125
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,930
So they are supplementary.

126
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,320
So let me write that down.

127
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:04,660
Angle DBA and angle
ABC are supplementary.

128
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,990
They add up to 180 degrees.

129
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,675
But they are also
adjacent angles.

130
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:14,400

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,050
And because they're
supplementary

132
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,340
and they're adjacent, if you
look at the broader angle,

133
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,170
the angle used from the sides
that they don't have in common.

134
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:29,180
If you look at
angle DBC, this is

135
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,330
going to be essentially
a straight line, which

136
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,560
we can call a straight angle.

137
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,490
So I introduced you to
a bunch of words here.

138
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,680
And now I think we have
all of the tools we

139
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,050
need to start doing
some interesting proofs.

140
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,545
And just to review here,
we talked about any angles

141
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:55,160
that add up to 90 degrees are
considered to be complementary.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,830
This is adding up to 90 degrees.

143
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,160
If they happen to be adjacent,
then the two outside sides

144
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,390
will form a right angle.

145
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,370
When you have a right angle,
the two sides of a right angle

146
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,470
are considered to
be perpendicular.

147
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,760
And then if you have two angles
that add up to 180 degrees,

148
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,770
they're considered
supplementary.

149
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,690
And then if they
happen to be adjacent,

150
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,680
they will form a straight angle.

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,440
Or another way, if you said,
if you have a straight angle

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,910
and you have one of the
angles, the other angle

153
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,540
is going to be
supplementary to it.

154
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,710
They're going to add
up to 180 degrees.

155
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,710
So I'll leave you there.

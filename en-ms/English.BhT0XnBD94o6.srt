00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, ladies and gentlemen, at TED

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and dissect some lessons from it.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to stand out and be ridiculed.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But what he's doing is so easy to follow.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So here's his first follower with a crucial role;

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
he's going to show everyone else how to follow.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, now it's not about the leader anymore;

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
it's about them, plural.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, there he is calling to his friends.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, if you notice that the first follower

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It takes guts to stand out like that.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The first follower is what transforms

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a lone nut into a leader.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
(Laughter)

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
(Applause)

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And here comes a second follower.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts --

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So a movement must be public.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's important to show not just to show the leader, but the followers,

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because you find that new followers

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
emulate the followers, not the leader.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, here come two more people, and immediately after,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
three more people.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now we've got a movement.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, notice that, as more people join in,

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
it's less risky.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So those that were sitting on the fence before, now have no reason not to.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They won't stand out,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
they won't be ridiculed,

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
(Laughter)

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, over the next minute,

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
because eventually they would be ridiculed

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
for not joining in.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And that's how you make a movement.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But let's recap some lessons from this.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So first, if you are the type,

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone,

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
remember the importance of nurturing

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
your first few followers as equals

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so it's clearly about the movement, not you.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The biggest lesson, if you noticed --

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
did you catch it? -- is that leadership

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is over-glorified.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That, yes, it was the shirtless guy who was first,

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and he'll get all the credit,

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but it was really the first follower

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that transformed the lone nut into a leader.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, as we're told that we should all be leaders,

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that would be really ineffective.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you really care about starting a movement,

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
have the courage to follow

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and show others how to follow.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And when you find a lone nut doing something great,

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
have the guts to be the first one

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to stand up and join in.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And what a perfect place to do that, at TED.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thanks.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
(Applause)

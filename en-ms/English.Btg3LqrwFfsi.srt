CUTTS: Hi, my name is Matt Cutts. I'm an engineer in the quality group at Google and I'd like

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,950
to talk today about what happens when you do a web search. The first thing to understand

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,560
is that when you do a Google search, you aren't actually searching the web, you're searching

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,599
Google's index of the web, or at least as much of it as we can find. We do this with

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,000
software programs called spiders. Spiders start by fetching a few web pages then they

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,980
follow the links on those pages and fetch the pages they point to, and follow all the

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,660
links on those pages and fetch the pages they link to and so on, until we've indexed a pretty

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,489
big chunk of the web--many billions of pages stored across thousands of machines. Now,

10
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:55,670
suppose I want to know how fast a cheetah can run. I type in my search, say, cheetah

11
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,670
running speed and hit return. Our software searches our index to find every page that

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,479
includes those search terms. In this case, there are hundreds of thousands of possible

13
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,240
results. How does Google decide which few documents I really want? By asking questions--more

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,550
than 200 of them. Like, how many times does this page contain your keywords? Do the words

15
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,860
appear in the title, in the URL, directly adjacent? Does the page include synonyms for

16
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:34,490
those words? Is this page from a quality website or is it low quality, even spamming? What

17
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,610
is this page's PageRank? That's a formula invented by our founders Larry Page and Sergey

18
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,750
Brin that rates a web page's importance by looking at how many outside links point to

19
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,540
it, and how important those links are. Finally, we combine all those factors together to produce

20
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,820
each page's overall score and send you back your search results about half a second after

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,910
you submit your search. At Google, we take our commitment to delivering useful and impartial

22
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:07,810
search results very seriously. We don't ever accept payment to add a site to our index,

23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,420
update it more often or improve its ranking. Let's take a look at my search results. Each

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,239
entry includes a title, a URL and a snippet of text to help me decide whether this page

25
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,999
is what I'm looking for. I also see links to similar pages, Google's most recent stored

26
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:30,999
version of that page, and related searches that I might want to try next. And sometimes,

27
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:39,060
along the right and at the top, I'll see adds. We take our advertising business very seriously

28
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,879
as well, both our commitment to deliver the best possible audience for advertisers and

29
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,040
to strive to only show ads that you really want to see. We're very careful to distinguish

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
your ads from regular search results and we won't show you any ads at all if we can't

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,829
find any that we think will help you find the information you're looking for--which,

32
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:04,180
in this case, the cheetah's top running speed is more than 60 miles an hour. Thanks for

33
00:03:04,180 --> 99:59:59,999
watching, I hope this made Google a little bit more understandable.

[Male narrator] I would argue poker is partially observable

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because it can't be seen what is in your opponent's hands.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It is stochastic because you're being dealt cards that are kind of coming at random.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It is not continuous; it's just finding many cards

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and finding many actions you can do, even though you might argue

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that there's a huge number of different monies you can bet.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's still finite, and it is clearly adversarial.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you've ever played poker before, you know how brutal it can be.

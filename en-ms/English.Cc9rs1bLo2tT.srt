1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,580
Find the probability
of getting exactly two

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,530
heads when flipping three coins.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,230
So let's think about
the sample space.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,910
Let's think about all of
the possible outcomes.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,230
So I could get all heads.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,470
So on flip one I get a
head, flip two I get a head,

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,070
flip three I get a head.

9
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,080
I could get two heads
and then a tail.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,190
I could get heads,
tails, heads, or I

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,420
could get heads, tails, tails.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,760
I could get tails, heads, heads.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,420
I could get tails, heads, tails.

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,040
I could get tails, tails, heads.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,992
Or I could get tails,
tails, and tails.

16
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:40,450
These are all of
the different ways

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,990
that I could flip three coins.

18
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,406
And you can maybe
say that this is

19
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:45,660
the first flip, the second
flip, and the third flip.

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,930
Now, so this right over
here is the sample space.

21
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,610
There's eight possible outcomes.

22
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,340
Let me write this, the
probability of exactly two

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:00,860
heads, I'll say H's
there for short.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,640
The probability of
exactly two heads, well

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,959
what is the size of
our sample space?

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,620
I have eight possible outcomes.

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,510
So eight, this is
possible outcomes,

28
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,150
or the size of our sample
space, possible outcomes.

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,610
And how many of those
possible outcomes

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,050
are associated with this event?

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,620
You could call this
a compound event,

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,610
because there's more
than one outcome that's

33
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,560
associated with this.

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,280
Let's think about
exactly two heads.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,840
This is three heads, so
it's not exactly two heads.

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,390
This is exactly two
heads right over here.

37
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,570
This is exactly two
heads right over here.

38
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,990
There's only one head.

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,690
This is exactly two heads.

40
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,400
This is only one head,
only one head, no heads.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,400
So you have one, two, three
of the possible outcomes

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
are associated with this event.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,410
So you have three
possible outcomes.

44
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,620
Three outcomes
associated with event.

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,870
Three outcomes
satisfy this event,

46
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,570
are associated with this event.

47
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,860
So the probability of
getting exactly two heads

48
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,240
when flipping three
coins is three outcomes

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,300
satisfying this event over
eight possible outcomes.

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,410
So it is 3/8.

51
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,026

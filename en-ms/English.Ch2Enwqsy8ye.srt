1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720


2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,370
We're told that the total cost
of filling up your car with

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,540
gas varies directly with the
number of gallons of gasoline

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,880
you are purchasing.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,800
So this first statement tells
us that if x is equal to the

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:28,790
number of gallons purchased, and
y is equal to the cost of

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,300
filling up the car, this first
statement tells us that y

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,450
varies directly with the number
of gallons, with x.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,850
So that means that y is equal
to some constant, we'll just

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,050
call that k, times x.

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,310
This is what it means
to vary directly.

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,670
If x goes up, y will go up.

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,150
We don't know what the rate
is. k tells us the rate.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,100
If x goes down, y
will be down.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,850
Now, they give us more
information, and this will

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,260
help us figure out what k is.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,570
If a gallon of gas costs $2.25,
how many gallons could

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,700
you purchase for $18?

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,350
So if x is equal to 1-- this
statement up here, a gallon of

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,090
gas-- that tells us if we get 1
gallon, if x is equal to 1,

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,060
then y is $2.25, right?

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,390
y is what it costs.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,300
They tell us 1 gallon costs
$2.25, so you could write it

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:33,190
right here, $2.25 is equal
to k times x, times 1.

25
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,190
Well, I didn't even have to
write the times 1 there.

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,330
It's essentially telling
us exactly what the

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,900
rate is, what k is.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,260
We don't even have to
write that 1 there.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,880
k is equal to 2.25.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,450
That's what this told
us right there.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:51,220
So the equation, how y varies
with x, is y is equal to

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,710
2.25x, where x is the number
of gallons we purchase.

33
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,650
y is the cost of that
purchase, so

34
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,390
it's $2.25 a gallon.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,320
And then they ask us, how
many gallons could you

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,590
purchase for $18?

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,690
So $18 is going to be our total
cost. It is y cost of

38
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,990
filling the car.

39
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,690
So 18 is going to be
equal to 2.25x.

40
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,020
Now if we want to solve for x,
we can divide both sides by

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,730
2.25, so let's do that.

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,310
You divide 18 by 2.25,
divide 2.25x by 2.25,

43
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,610
and what do we get?

44
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,520
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,650
The right-hand side, the 2.25's
cancel out, you get x.

46
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,020
And then what is 18
divided by 2.25?

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,090
So let me write this down.

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,210
So first of all, I just like to
think of it as a fraction.

49
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,930
2.25 is the same thing-- let me
write over here-- 2.25 is

50
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,160
equal to 2 and 1/4, which is
the same thing as 9 over 4.

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:12,480
So 18 divided by 2.25 is equal
to 18 divided by 9 over 4,

52
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,960
which is equal to 18 times
4 over 9, or 18 over 1

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,160
times 4 over 9.

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,540
And let's see, 18 divided by 9
is 2, 9 divided by 9 is 1.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,330
That simplifies pretty
nicely into 8.

56
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:37,915
So 18 divided by 2.25 is 8, so
we can buy 8 gallons for $18.

57
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:38,800

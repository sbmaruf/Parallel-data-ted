1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540


2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,120
We're asked to graph y is equal
to x squared minus x,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,760
minus 6 by plotting points.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,280
Let's just make a table.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,300
Let's just pick some x values,
and figure out what y is going

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,660
to be based on this
relation up here.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,480
So let's figure out what
y is going to be.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,745
So let's just start
x at negative 3.

9
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:25,760
So if x is negative 3, then y
is going to be negative 3

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,560
squared is 9, minus negative
3-- so that's

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,950
plus 3-- minus 6.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,810
So what is that?

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,540
9 plus 3 is 12, minus 6,
this is equal to 6.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,260
Then we get-- let's just keep
going before we plot any

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,530
points-- so then we
have negative 2.

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,750
If x is equal to negative 2,
then y is negative 2 squared,

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:55,060
which is 4, minus negative 2,
so that's plus 2, minus 6.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,480
So in that situation, we
have 4 plus 2, minus 6,

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,410
it's equal to 0.

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,750
Then if x is equal to negative
1, we have negative 1 squared,

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,930
which is positive 1, minus
negative 1, which is another

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,210
positive 1.

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,810
Then we have minus 6.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,980
2 minus 6 is equal
to negative 4.

25
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,240
Let's go to 0.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,700
If x is equal to 0, these
two terms are 0.

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,630
And then y is equal
to negative 6.

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,620
So let's just go all the
way to positive 3.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,690
If x is equal to 1, we have
1 squared minus 1.

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,130
Those cancel out.

31
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,450
And then you have just
a negative 6 there.

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,030


33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,800
And then if we have x is equal
to 2, we have 2 squared, which

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,530
is 4, minus 2, minus 6.

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,490
So 4 minus 2 is 2, minus 6
is equal to negative 4.

36
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,750
And then if x is equal to 3, we
have 3 squared, which is 9,

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,690
minus 3, right?

38
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,140
9 minus 3, minus 6.

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,510
Well that's going to
be equal to 0.

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,280
So let's plot these points.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,440
So let me do it in a
dark color here.

42
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,660
So the first point is
negative 3 comma 6.

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,259
So this is my x-axis right
here, this is my y-axis.

44
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,250
So negative 3 is negative
1, 2, 3 comma 6.

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,720
So it will be right
over there.

47
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,820
That's this point over here.

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,600
And the next 1 is negative
2 comma 0.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,240
So negative 2, and then we
don't move up in the y

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
direction at all.

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
Then we have a negative
1 comma negative 4.

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,910
Negative 1.

53
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,960
1, 2, 3, 4.

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Negative 4 is right
over there.

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,720
Then we have 0, negative 6.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,180
0, x is 0.

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,970
y is negative 6.

58
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,040
So it's that point
right there.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,710
Then we have 1, negative 6.

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,670
So x is 1, y is negative 6.

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,770
And then we have-- and
then what do we have?

62
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,350
We have 2, negative 4.

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,190
So x is 2, y is negative 4.

64
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,860
And x is 3, y is 0.

65
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,100
So you can see, here, if we just
connect these plots, we

66
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,080
get a bit of a curve.

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
We get a bit of a u shape.

68
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,360
And the u shape will
look like this.

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,350
I'll do my best to draw it,
this is always the hardest

70
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,460
part, connecting the dots.

71
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,460
So let me just do it in one
nice-- so you get a u shape

72
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,190
that looks something
like that.

73
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,700
I can do a better job of
drawing that, I'm sure.

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,970
Let me do one last
shot at this.

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,570
So let me just draw as good of
a u shape as possible, just

76
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,770
keep going like that.

77
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,670
So you get this u
shape over here.

78
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,980
And this u shape, which is the
general shape of these

79
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,130
quadratic functions right here,

80
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,970
this is called a parabola.

81
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,920
So that u shape is called
a parabola.

82
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,110
And in the future we'll see
better ways to graph it, so

83
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,720
you don't have to just plot
a bunch of points.

84
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,670
But it's good to see the general
shape, and we get that

85
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,900
general shape just by trying
out a bunch of x values and

86
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,940
figuring out the corresponding
y values.

87
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,400

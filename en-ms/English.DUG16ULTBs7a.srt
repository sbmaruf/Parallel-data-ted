00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
praise, admiration and thank you,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and having it be specific and genuine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the way I got interested in this was,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and until about a few years ago,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that I would want to say thank you to someone,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I would want to praise them,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I would want to take in their praise of me

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and I'd just stop it.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I asked myself, why?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then my question became,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
am I the only one who does this?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, I decided to investigate.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But then, they hear from all the family and friends

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but he never told the son.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years,

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
who's longing to hear his wife say,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but won't ask.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I know a woman who's good at this.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says,

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And praise really does have to be genuine,

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but she takes responsibility for that.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
she thanks her children for doing their chores.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why were other people blocking it?

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I need size six shoes," but I won't say,

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
"Would you praise me this way?"

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm telling you where I need your help.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I'm treating you, my inner circle,

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
like you're the enemy.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Because what can you do with that data?

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You could neglect me.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You could abuse it.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Or you could actually meet my need.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this --

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
it's going to make the bike so much better."

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I get the same bike back,

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I want you to true your wheels:

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
be honest about the praise that you need to hear.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife --

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
go ask her, what does she need?

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And it's simple.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And why should we care about this?

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We talk about world peace.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I want to thank all of you in the audience

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
for being great husbands, great mothers,

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
friends, daughters, sons.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And maybe somebody's never said that to you,

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but you've done a really, really good job.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And thank you for being here, just showing up

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and changing the world with your ideas.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
(Applause)

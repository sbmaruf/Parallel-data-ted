1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,990
Let's talk about one of the most

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,560
important biological processes.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,220
Frankly, if this process didn't occur, we probably

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,608
wouldn't have life on Earth,

5
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,438
and I wouldn't be making this video for you.

6
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:13,360
Because there'd be no place for me to actually get food.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,800
And the process is called "photosynthesis."

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,410
And you're probably reasonably familiar with the idea.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,336
The whole idea is plants --

10
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:29,184
and actually bacteria and algae and other things --

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,430
But we normally associate it with plants --

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,600
Let me make it in very simple terms.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,190
So we normally associate it with plants.

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,058
And it's a process that plants use,

15
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,730
And we might have learned this when we were very young.

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,561
It's the process that plants use to take carbon dioxide,

17
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:53,859
plus some water, plus some sunlight,

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:01:00,010
and turn it into some sugars, or some, maybe, carbohydrates.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,150
Carbohydrates or sugars, plus oxygen.

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,360
Obviously, this has two very profound pieces to it for us

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,790
as a living species.

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,200
One, we need carbohydrates or we need sugars in order to

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,240
fuel our bodies.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,680
You saw that in the cellular respiration videos.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,540
We generate all of our ATP by performing cellular

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,990
respiration on glucose, which is essentially a byproduct,

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,015
or a broken down carbohydrate.

28
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:30,530
It's the simplest one for us to process in cellular respiration.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,240
And the second hugely important part

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,330
is getting the oxygen.

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,490
Once again, we need to breathe oxygen in order for us to

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,500
break down glucose, in order to respire, in order to

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,100
perform cellUar respiration.

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,878
So these two things are key for life,

35
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:54,375
especially for life [forms] that breathes oxygen.

36
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,974
So this process -- other than the fact that it's interesting,

37
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:01,200
that there are organisms around us --

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,130
mostly plants -- that are able to harness actual sunlight.

39
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,900
You have these fusion reactions in the sun

40
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,110
93 million miles away. And it's releasing these photons, and

41
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,570
some small subset of those photons reach

42
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,790
the surface of Earth.

43
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,690
They make their way through clouds and whatever else.

44
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,560
And then these plants and bacteria and algae are able to

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,010
harness that somehow and turn them into sugars that we can

46
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,120
then eat or maybe the cow eats them and we eat the cow if

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
we're not vegetarians, and we can then use that for energy.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,960
Not that the cow is all carbohydrates, but this is

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,200
essentially what is used as the fuel or the energy for all

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,365
of the other important compounds that we eat.

51
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,930
This is where we get all of our fuel.

52
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,296
So this is fuel for animals.

53
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,620
Or if you eat a potato directly, you are

54
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,380
directly getting your carbohydrates.

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,914
But anyway, this is a very simple notion of photosynthesis.

56
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:56,760
But it's not incorrect.

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,550
I mean, if you had to know one thing about photosynthesis,

58
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,290
this would be it.

59
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,640
But let's delve a little bit deeper and try to get into the

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,930
guts of it and see if we can understand a little bit better

61
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,970
how this actually happens.

62
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,780
I find it amazing that somehow photons of sunlight are used

63
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,202
to create these sugar molecules or these carbohydrates.

64
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,850
So let's delve a little bit deeper.

65
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,350
So we can write the general equation for photosynthesis.

66
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,530
Well, I've almost written it here.

67
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,720
But I'll write it a little bit more scientifically specific.

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,640
You start off with some carbon dioxide.

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,890
You add to that some water, and you add to that-- instead

70
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,030
of sunlight, I'm going to say photons because these are what

71
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,070
really do excite the electrons in the chlorophyll that go

72
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,970
down, and you'll see this process probably in this

73
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,530
video, and we'll go in more detail in the next few videos.

74
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,100
But that excited electron goes to a high energy state, and as

75
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,290
it goes to a lower energy state, we're able to harness

76
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,180
that energy to produce ATPs, and you'll see NADPHs, and

77
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,180
those are used to produce carbohydrates.

78
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,080
But we'll see that in a little bit.

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,590
But the overview of photosynthesis, you start off

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,300
with these constituents. And then you end up with a

81
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,210
carbohydrate.

82
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,610
And a carbohydrate could be glucose,

83
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,080
(Doesn't have to be glucose.)

84
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,110
So the general way we can write a carbohydrates is CH2O.

85
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,210
And we'll put an n over here, that we could have n multiples

86
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,140
of these, and normally, n will be at least three.

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,990
In the case of glucose, n is 6.

88
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,420
You have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 6 oxygens.

89
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,610
So this is a general term for carbohydrates.

90
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,100
But you could have many multiples of that.

91
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,810
You could have these long-chained carbohydrates.

92
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,620
So, you end up with a carbohydrate and then you end

93
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,920
up with some oxygen.

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,730
So this right here isn't so different than what I wrote up

95
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,100
here in my first overview of how we always imagined

96
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,720
photosynthesis in our heads.

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,190
In order to make this equation balance-- let's see, I have n

98
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,780
carbons so I need n carbons there.

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,860
Let's see, I have two n hydrogens here.

100
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,470
Two hydrogens and I have n there, so I need two n

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,020
hydrogens here.

102
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,150
So I'll put an n out there.

103
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,400
And lets see how many oxygens.

104
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,635
I have two n oxygens, plus another n, so I

105
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:13,880
have three n oxygens.

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,455
So let's see, I have one n, and you put an n here, and

107
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:21,890
then I have two n, and I think this equation balances out.

108
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,850
So this is a 30,000-foot view of what's going on in

109
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,760
photosynthesis.

110
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,730
But when you dig a little deeper, you'll see that this

111
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,900
doesn't happen directly, that this happens through a bunch

112
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,270
of steps that eventually gets us to the carbohydrate.

113
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,850
So in general, we can break down photosynthesis.

114
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,440
I'll rewrite the word.

115
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,830
We can break down photosynthesis-- and we'll

116
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,960
delve deeper into future videos, but I want to get you

117
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,220
the overview first-- into two stages.

118
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,080
We can call one the light reactions.

119
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,900
Or sometimes they are called the light-dependent reactions,

120
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,010
and that actually would probably be a better

121
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,830
way to write it.

122
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,840
Let me write it like that.

123
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Light dependent means that they need light to occur.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,300
Light-dependent reactions.

125
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,500
And then you have something called the dark reactions, and

126
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,140
that's actually a bad name, because it also

127
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,850
occurs in the light.

128
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,300
Dark reactions, I wrote in a slightly darker color.

129
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,420
And the reason why I said it's a bad name is because it still

130
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,800
occurs in the light.

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,950
But the reason why they probably called it the dark

132
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,100
reaction is that you don't need light, or that part of

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,620
photosynthesis isn't dependent on photons to occur.

134
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,130
So a better term for it would have been

135
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:55,700
"light-independent reaction."

136
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,190
So just to be clear, the light reactions

137
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,910
actually need sunlight.

138
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,420
They actually need photons for them to proceed.

139
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,510
The dark reactions do not need photons for them to happen,

140
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,240
although they do occur when the sun is out.

141
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,010
They don't need those photons, but they need the byproducts

142
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,800
from the light reaction to occur, so that's why it's

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,230
called the light-independent reaction.

144
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,300
They occur while the sun is out, but they

145
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,580
don't need the sun.

146
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,270
This needs the sun, so let me make it very clear.

147
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,970
So this requires sunlight.

148
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,350
This requires photons.

149
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,280
And let me just make a very brief overview of this.

150
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
This'll maybe let us start building a scaffold from which

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,400
we can dig deeper.

152
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,880
So the light reactions need photons, and

153
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,010
then it needs water.

154
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,600
So water goes into the light reactions and out of the other

155
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,820
side of the light reactions.

156
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,850
We end up with some molecular oxygen.

157
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,875
So that's what happens in the light reactions, and I'm going

158
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,370
to go much deeper into what actually occurs.

159
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:03,030
And what the light the actions produce is ATP, which we know

160
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,710
is the cellular or the biological currency of energy.

161
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,750
It produces ATP and it produces NADPH.

162
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,790
Now, when we studied cellular respiration, we saw the

163
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,930
molecule NADH.

164
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,310
NADPH is very similar.

165
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,260
You just have this P there.

166
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,710
You just have this phosphate group there, but they really

167
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,590
perform similar mechanisms. That this agent right here,

168
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,659
this molecule right here, is able to give away-- now let's

169
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,039
think about what this means-- it's able to give away this

170
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,960
hydrogen and the electron associated with this hydrogen.

171
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,870
So if you give away an electron to someone else or

172
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,690
someone else gains an electron, that something else

173
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,310
is being reduced.

174
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,500
Let me write that down.

175
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,350
This is a good reminder.

176
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,820
OIL RIG.

177
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,750
Oxidation is losing an electron.

178
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,750
Reduction is gaining an electron.

179
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,430
Your charge is reduced when you gain an electron.

180
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,950
It has a negative charge.

181
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,770
So this is a reducing agent.

182
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,810
It gets oxidized by losing the hydrogen and the

183
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,620
electron with it.

184
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,060
I have a whole discussion on the biological versus

185
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,670
chemistry view of oxidation, but it's the same idea.

186
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,530
When I lose a hydrogen, I also lose the ability to hog that

187
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,130
hydrogen's electron.

188
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,270
So this right here, when it reacts with other things, it's

189
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,910
a reducing agent.

190
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,030
It gives away this hydrogen and the electron associated

191
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,550
with it, and so the other thing gets reduced.

192
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,660
So this thing is a reducing agent.

193
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,890
And what's useful about it is when this hydrogen, and

194
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,230
especially the electron associated with that hydrogen,

195
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,950
goes from the NADPH to, say, another molecule and goes to a

196
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,750
lower energy state, that energy can also be used in the

197
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,570
dark reactions.

198
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,800
And we saw in cellular respiration the very similar

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,570
molecule, NADH, that through
the Kreb Cycle, or actually

200
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,950
more importantly, that through the electron transport chain,

201
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,350
was able to help produce ATP as it gave away its electrons

202
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,770
and they went to lower energy states.

203
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,410
But I don't want to confuse you too much.

204
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,280
So the light reactions, you take in photons, you take in

205
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,930
water, it spits out oxygen, and it spits out ATP and NADPH

206
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,030
that can then be used in the dark reactions.

207
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,520
And the dark reactions, for most plants we talk about,

208
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,770
it's called the Calvin Cycle.

209
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,370
And I'll go into a lot more detail of what actually occurs

210
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,810
in the Calvin Cycle, but it
takes in the ATP, the NADPH,

211
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:56,480
and it produces-- it doesn't directly produce glucose.

212
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,410
It produces-- oh, you probably saw this.

213
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,330
You could call it PGAL.

214
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,990
You could call it G3P.

215
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,410
These all stand for-- let me write these down-- this is

216
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,660
phosphoglyceraldehyde.

217
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,410
My handwriting broke down.

218
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,910
Or you could call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

219
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,210
Same exact molecule.

220
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,320
You can almost imagine it as -- this is a very gross

221
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,000
oversimplification-- as three carbons with a phosphate group

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,250
attached to it.

223
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:51,750
But this can then be used to produce other carbohydrates,

224
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,620
including glucose.

225
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,970
If you have two of these, you can use those

226
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,160
two to produce glucose.

227
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,820
So let's just take a quick overview again because this is

228
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,610
super important.

229
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm going to make videos on the light reactions and the

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,030
dark reactions.

231
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,850
Those will be the next two videos I make.

232
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,450
So photosynthesis, you start with photons.

233
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,500
All of these occur when the sun is out, but only the light

234
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,270
reactions actually need the photons.

235
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,090
The light reactions take photons-- we're going to go

236
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,740
into more detail about what actually occurs--

237
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,550
and it takes in water.

238
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,130
Oxygen gets spit out.

239
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,670
ATP and NADPH get spit out, which are then used by the

240
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,020
dark reaction, or the Calvin Cycle, or the

241
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,310
light-independent reaction, because these still

242
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,470
occur in the light.

243
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,820
They just don't need photons.

244
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,980
So they're the light-independent reaction.

245
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,530
And it uses that in conjunction-- and we'll talk

246
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,940
about other molecules that are used in conjunction.

247
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,950
Oh, and I forgot a very important constituent of the

248
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,840
dark reaction.

249
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,690
It needs carbon dioxide.

250
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,070
That's where you get your carbons to keep producing

251
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,220
these phosphoglyceraldehydes, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

252
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,600
So that's super important.

253
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,830
It takes in the carbon dioxide, the products from the

254
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,000
light reactions, and then uses that in the Calvin Cycle to

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,070
produce this very simple building block of other

256
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,980
carbohydrates.

257
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,790
And if you remember from glycolysis, you might remember

258
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,650
that this PGAL molecule, or this G3P-- same thing-- this

259
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,210
was actually the first product when we split glucose in two

260
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,720
when we performed the glycolysis.

261
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,270
So now we're going the other way.

262
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,540
We're building glucose so that we can split

263
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,910
it later for energy.

264
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,340
So this is an overview of photosynthesis, and in the

265
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,090
next couple of videos, I'm actually going to delve a

266
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,430
little bit deeper and tell you about the light reactions and

267
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,630
the dark reactions and how they actually occur.

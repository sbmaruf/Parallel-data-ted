1
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:12,829
What you're about to embark upon is unlike any other experience you´ve ever had

2
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:17,217
We're going to travel throughout history and question every single principle that you have

3
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:19,852
We do this so we can understand our world

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,109
The reason why it´s gonna be unlike any other experience you´ve ever had

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,690
is that I´m goig to
insist that you question and critically think about all the information I present to you

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,860
Don´t believe anything I say unless you can confirm it and that it resonate with something in your soul

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,630
If you can do that you are in the first steps of becoming totally free!

8
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:44,687
The reason why I produce this project is to create the intellectual foundation for a new era of humanity

9
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:48,558
We do not have to live in a society based on debt and death

10
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:52,937
We can produce a society that is founded upon freedom

11
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,639
where everybody´s rights are protected

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,170
and everybody has the ability to rise to their highest and best self

13
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:01,622
I´ve spent 6 years putting together all the information that I can,

14
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:05,963
to help people understand
why we are where we are today

15
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:08,742
who controles our world and where it's going to go.

16
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:12,243
I don't claim to be the originator of a lot of the ideas that I present to you

17
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:14,652
I don't even have all the answers

18
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,942
but I do intend to ask all the questions

19
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,311
because i know the power of the question

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,270
when people start questioning their reality people start becoming free

21
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:28,023
My unique ability, is to be able to bring all this information in a clear narative

22
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,639
where people can understand what is going on in this world

23
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:36,436
I believe that when people are aware of how the world works they can prepare for any chalenges that we need to face

24
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:42,164
This project is an encompassing educational experience that seeks to tell the greatest truth never told.

25
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:45,193
Through out all of history there's always been a small group of men

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,480
that have ruled over all of humanity

27
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,435
for there own personal power and profit

28
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:52,716
The most amazing aspect to this fact

29
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,218
is that it's physicaly impossible for such a small group of men to control so many people

30
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,613
Once we see how this men work

31
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:03,161
and how they're able to manipulate societies

32
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:08,506
we see that at the end of the day the probleme doesn't lies with them, it lies within us.

33
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:13,023
It is only possible if they can control what's inside of here,...

34
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,521
and that's what this project seeks to do, it seeks to open up your mind

35
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:20,545
so that you stop thinking like they want you to think

36
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:23,107
and that you start becoming your highest and best self.

37
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:28,111
This educational journey that you're going to be taking in this project, will be a dangerous one.

38
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:31,887
one that if I'm successful will result in your old self dying

39
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:35,996
this is necessary for your new totally free self to be born

40
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,799
This is truly a life changing experience

41
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,839
and one: if enough people will grasp on to the concepts that I'll be teaching

42
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:50,109
will result into a new era of humanity so that we don't have to go down the road of fear and tyrany

43
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,357
Once you're aware of how the world really works

44
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,079
you will no longer replay the fool

45
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,876
in your relationships, your investements,

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,760
or even your thoughts.

47
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,855
If you notice the most successful peoples in your life

48
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:04,277
they're usually not the one that are the smartest or hardest working

49
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:07,827
but thet are the people who were at the right place at the right time.

50
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:13,392
Understanding how the world works will alow you to put yourself in the right place at the right time.

51
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:19,271
This project seeks to give you the absolut clarity on how the world works and where we are going.

52
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:24,763
That will give you the massive confidence to take massive dramatic actions in your own personal life

53
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:27,403
So that you, are in the right place at the right time.

54
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,270
If I can leave you with one final thought before we continue on

55
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:32,872
it's something that I came up with

56
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:36,231
as I was going through my own awakaning and educational experience

57
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,870
and it is :

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000

1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,960
We're asked to represent the
inequality y is greater than 5

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,790
on a number line and on
the coordinate plane.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,300
Let's do the number
line first.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,970
Let me just draw out
a number line.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,420
That's my number line, all
the possible values of y.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,560
Let's make that 0 on
the number line.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,000
We could obviously go into
negative numbers, but we're

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,750
going to be greater than
5, so I'll focus on

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,620
the positive side.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:31,940
So let's say that's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, and then 6, 7, so

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,000
forth and so on.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,350
This number line represents y,
and y is going to be greater

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,160
than 5, not greater
than or equal to.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,790
So we're not going to be
including 5 in the numbers

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,240
that can be y.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,790
So we're not going to include
5, so we're going to do an

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,530
open circle around 5, and all
of the other values greater

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,470
than 5 will be included.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,990
So if there was a greater than
or equal to sign, we would

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,830
have filled it in, but since
it's just greater than, we're

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,330
not including the 5.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,360
So we've represented it
on the number line.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,900
Let's do the same thing on
the coordinate plane.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,010
Let me draw a coordinate
plane here.

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,620
I'm just using the standard
convention.

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,760
That is my y-axis right there.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,540
And then the horizontal axis,
I'll just assume is my x-axis.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,740
Let me draw some y values,
positive y values.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,910
That is 5 right there, and you
go 6, 7, you can just keep

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,180
going into larger and
larger numbers.

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,250
And we want y to be greater than
5, so it's not going to

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,770
be greater than or equal to.

34
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,920
So we're not going
to include 5.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,170
So at 5, at y is equal to 5,
we will draw a dotted line.

36
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,310
That shows that we're not
including y is equal to 5, but

37
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,750
we want include all of the other
values greater than 5.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,580
So that we will shade in.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,540
So here we have shaded in all of
the values greater than 5.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,070
If it was greater than or equal
to 5, we would have

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,590
drawn a bold line over here.

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,610
So no matter what x is, no
matter what x we pick, y is

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,310
going to be greater than 5.

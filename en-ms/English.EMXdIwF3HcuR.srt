1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,740
Solve for x plus 8 is
less than or equal to 6

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,700
and graph the solution.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,480
So we have x plus 8 is
less than or equal to 6.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,810
So let's solve this
inequality for x.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,724
And the easiest way to isolate
an x on-- let's isolate

7
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:20,390
on the left-hand side
since it's already

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,130
there-- is to just
get rid of this 8.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,046
And the best way to get
rid of this positive 8

10
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:27,640
is to subtract 8 from both
sides So let's subtract 8

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,480
from both sides.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,795
That won't change the
direction of the inequality.

13
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:34,210
So the left-hand side--
x plus 8 minus 8.

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,690
And you're just left with an x.

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,350
The right-hand side-- 6
minus 8 is negative 2.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,910
And we still have the
less than or equal.

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,260
So we solved the inequality.

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,440
We have x is less than
or equal to negative 2.

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,940
So let's draw that
on a number line.

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,900
So that's my number line.

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,440
Let's stick 0 over here.

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,370
Maybe if we go 1,
and then we could

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,800
go negative 1,
negative 2, negative 3.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,612
And we could keep
going to the left.

25
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,070
And we want all of
the x's that are

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,610
less than or equal
to negative 2.

27
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,690
Since it can be
equal to negative 2,

28
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,850
we'll put a filled-in line
right here at negative 2,

29
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,190
and all of the values
less than that.

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,777
If it was just less than, if
there wasn't the equal sign,

31
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,860
we would have an open dot.

32
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,890
But since this is
less than or equal to,

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,390
we've closed this dot.

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,620
And then we want all of
the values below that.

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,380
And you could just sample a
few and verify for yourself

36
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,280
that they work.

37
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,010
Based on this,
negative 3 should work.

38
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,200
And if you took negative
3-- negative 3 plus 8

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,590
is 5, which is definitely
less than 6, so that works.

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,870
And negative 1 shouldn't work.

41
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,710
It's not included in
this set over here.

42
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,160
So let's try that out.

43
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,330
Negative 1 plus 8 is 7, which
is definitely not less than 6.

44
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,150
So just sampling
some points, it seems

45
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,820
like we've got the
right solution.

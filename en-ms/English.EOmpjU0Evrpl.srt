1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,700
We're asked to solve
the quadratic equation,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,620
negative 3x squared plus
10x minus 3 is equal to 0.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,560
And it's already written
in standard form.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,060
And there's many
ways to solve this.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,600
But in particular, all solve
it using the quadratic formula.

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,677
So let me just rewrite it.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,440
We have negative 3x squared
plus 10x minus 3 is equal to 0.

8
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:20,815
And actually, I'll
solve it twice

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,720
using the quadratic
formula to show you

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,350
that as long as we manipulated
this in the valid way,

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,850
the quadratic
formula will give us

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,900
the exact same roots or
the exact same solutions

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,370
to this equation.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,320
So in this form right over
here, what are our ABCs?

15
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:36,782
Let's just remind ourselves
what the quadratic formula even

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,450
is actually.

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,730
That's a good place to start.

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,640
The quadratic formula
tells us that if we

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,170
have a quadratic
equation in the form ax

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,320
squared plus bx plus c is equal
to 0, so in standard form,

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,360
then the roots of this are
x are equal to negative b

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,630
plus or minus the
square root of b

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:02,430
squared minus 4ac,
all of that over 2a.

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,240
And this is derived from
completing the square

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,409
in a general way.

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,910
So it's no magic here, and I've
derived it in other videos.

27
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:11,334
But this is the
quadratic formula.

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,910
This is actually giving
you two solutions,

29
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,890
because you have the
positive square root here

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,680
and the negative square root.

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,750
So let's apply it here in the
case where-- in this case,

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,890
a is equal to negative
3, b is equal to 10,

33
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,000
and c is equal to negative 3.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,240
So applying the quadratic
formula right here,

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,530
we get our solutions to be
x is equal to negative b.

36
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:37,526
b is 10.

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,800
So negative b is negative 10
plus or minus the square root

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,690
of b squared.

39
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,460
b is 10.

40
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,650
So b squared is 100
minus 4 times a times c.

41
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,390
So minus 4 times negative
3 times negative 3.

42
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,467
Let me just write it down.

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,930
Minus 4 times negative
3 times negative 3.

44
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,100
All of that's under
the radical sign.

45
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,860
And then all of that is over 2a.

46
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,540
So 2 times a is negative 6.

47
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,660
So this is going to be
equal to negative 10

48
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,710
plus or minus the square root
of 100 minus-- negative 3 times

49
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,080
negative 3 is positive 9.

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Positive 9 times
4 is positive 36.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,530
We have a minus sign out here.

52
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,610
So minus 36.

53
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,860
All of that over negative 6.

54
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,310
This is equal to
100 minus 36 is 64.

55
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,830
So negative 10 plus or
minus the square root of 64.

56
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,900
All of that over negative 6.

57
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,940
The principal square
root of 64 is 8.

58
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,229
But we're taking the positive
and negative square root.

59
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,940
So this is negative 10 plus
or minus 8 over negative 6.

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,620
So if we take the
positive version,

61
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,210
we say x could be
equal to-- negative 10

62
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,560
plus 8 is negative
2 over negative 6.

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,570
So that was taking
the plus version.

64
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,330
That's this right over here.

65
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,940
And negative 2 over
negative 6 is equal to 1/3.

66
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,840
If we take the
negative square root,

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,610
negative 10 minus 8-- So let's
take negative 10 minus 8.

68
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,030
That would be x is equal
to-- negative 10 minus 8

69
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,070
is negative 18.

70
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,490
And that's going to
be over negative 6.

71
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,930
Negative 18 divided by
negative 6 is positive 3.

72
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,380
So the two roots for
this quadratic equation

73
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,490
are positive 1/3 and positive 3.

74
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,702
And I want to show you the
we'll get the same answer,

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,740
even if we manipulate this.

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,280
Some people might
not like the fact

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,120
that our first coefficient
here is a negative 3.

78
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Maybe they want a positive 3.

79
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,246
So to get rid of
that negative 3,

80
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,010
they can multiply both sides of
this equation times negative 1.

81
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,270
And then if you did
that, you would get 3x

82
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,000
squared minus 10x plus 3 is
equal to 0 times negative 1,

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,900
which is still equal to 0.

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,990
So in this case, a is equal to
3, b is equal to negative 10,

85
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,430
and c is equal to 3 again.

86
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,400
And we could apply
the quadratic formula.

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
We get x is equal to
negative b. b is negative 10.

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,460
So negative negative
10 is positive

89
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,300
10, plus or minus
the square root

90
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,950
of b squared, which is
negative 10 squared,

91
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,110
which is 100, minus
4 times a times c.

92
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,070
a times c is 9 times 4 is 36.

93
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,980
So minus 36.

94
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,250
All of that over 2 times a.

95
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,990
All of that over 6.

96
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,030
So this is equal to 10 plus or
minus the square root of 64,

97
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,660
or really that's
just going to be 8.

98
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,210
All of that over 6.

99
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,420
If we add 8 here, we get
10 plus 8 is 18 over 6.

100
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,310
We get x could be equal to 3.

101
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,300
Or if we take the negative
square root or the negative 8

102
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,100
here, 10 minus 8 is 2.

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,280
2 over 6 is 1/3.

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,300
So once again, you get
the exact same solutions.

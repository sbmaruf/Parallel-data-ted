1
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:15,009
Master..Time to wake up..Master!

2
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,723
Time to wake up now.

3
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:22,043
Sir..

4
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:24,076
Master....MASTER!

5
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:26,244
You have to wake up ma-

6
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:27,055
You! What are you..

7
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:37,947
Five minutes... Let's stay like this... just for five minutes.

8
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:51,818
Even though I am holding you like this, I still can't believe you are here in front of me.

9
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,075
Hey Jun, I'm here!

10
00:00:53,075 --> 00:01:02,842
Lets..

11
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:06,211
Jandi..

12
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:12,082
How did this happen?

13
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:18,463
That...I---

14
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:19,096
Jaekyung?

15
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:23,112
It's not easy to wake up our JunPyo,

16
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:31,004
but it seems like you've already.

17
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:34,006
What? You?

18
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:43,044
Why are you here in those clothes?

19
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:47,006
Tell me? Who did this?

20
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:52,003
Who is the one who brought you into this house ?!

21
00:01:52,003 --> 00:02:00,262
It was me!

22
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:04,282
Grandmother !

23
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:06,004
Grandmother why are you here??

24
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,449
Long time no see..mistress

25
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,301
No, I shall call you President Kang now.

26
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:15,567
I still need to get used to it.

27
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,052
What is going on?

28
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:19,744
I hope you didn't forget.

29
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:25,006
The late president has left it in his will that my right and duty in house is tenured.

30
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:31,371
Even you, mistress, cannot undo that promise.

31
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:36,006
I don't care that you are in this house, but what about that child !

32
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:39,004
I cannot accept that she set foot in this house even for a moment.

33
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,562
Take her away immediately!

34
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,038
I can't do that.

35
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:43,962
Grandma !

36
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,008
I hired her out of my will,

37
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:51,198
so i can fire her when i will it.

38
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:55,038
I think this is no business of yours, mistress.

39
00:02:55,038 --> 00:03:00,053
Moreover, although she lacks experience as a maid,

40
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:06,076
that's why it is not time for her to leave.

41
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:09,094
If I let her leave without proper education,

42
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:15,094
what would people say about me and this household?

43
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,002
Grandmother!

44
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:19,064
What are you doing

45
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:23,008
Jandi follow me. We have a lot of work to do!

46
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,765
Yes!

47
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:58,646
Sunbae-nim

48
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:03,074
Thank you.

49
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:07,888
I didn't purposefully do it for your gratitude...

50
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:13,017
So don't misunderstand what?

51
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:20,248
I didn't do it just for JunHee's request.

52
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:23,384
While I've been away from here....

53
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:30,028
I was worried about Master Junpyo. He's a child at heart and a sensitive one at that,

54
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:36,236
and I knew that there will be a point when he'd snap.

55
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:43,044
I think Seohyun had told me something similar before.

56
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:48,001
But Master Junpyo's different now.

57
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:53,607
And I think it's because of you.

58
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:57,096
I have a great debt to this household.

59
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:07,028
I believe that the last thing I have to do before I die is to make sure that Master JunPyo will lead his life the right way.

60
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:12,729
I prided myself on my talent in judging people,

61
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:20,487
so I'm going to trust myself again.

62
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:42,482
Sunbae..

63
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:58,012
Don't you think..we should talk?

64
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,272
It's pretty.

65
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:04,002
I didn't know a maid uniform could look so pretty.

66
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:09,088
Jaekyung.. I...

67
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:13,096
I know. It was probably too hard to tell me.

68
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:20,002
I know your situation. When I think about it, I can understand why you did what you did.

69
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:24,182
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:25,454
But still,

71
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:32,044
...before I was JunPyo's fiancee, wasn't I your friend first?

72
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:37,002
It would have been nice if you discussed it with your friend first...

73
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:39,009
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,006
But please don't misunderstand.

75
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:44,667
I won't misunderstand.

76
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:49,052
But I do have something to say.

77
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:53,072
I'm not going to give up on JunPyo

78
00:06:53,072 --> 00:07:00,067
No. I'm going to try even harder from now on.

79
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:07,004
I'm going to do my best without any regrets

80
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:16,667
I just.I just wanted to tell you that, JanDi.

81
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:45,571
I'm going.

82
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:53,028
Yes.

83
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:58,189
Jaekyung..

84
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,466
Please don't misunderstand this situation.

85
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,081
As you saw....

86
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,666
those were Grandma's doings

87
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,096
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

88
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:14,199
Thank you. That's why I approve of you, Jaekyung.

89
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,056
I will get rid of that girl (JanDi) today.

90
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,002
Please, don't do that.

91
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,088
What?

92
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:27,002
JanDi, I think you should just leave her as she is.

93
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:31,000
Jaekyung.

94
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,686
And also..I have another thing to request.

95
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,056
We're done for today.

96
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,056
Thank you, everyone.

97
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:57,617
Good bye...

98
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:02,398
Why? GaEul, do you have something to say to me?

99
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:06,081
Ah..No...

100
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:10,427
Teacher EunJae-nim

101
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:31,088
How did you and he separate?

102
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,016
It's me. I'm on my way now.

103
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:39,024
All right. You better not eat it all without me...

104
00:09:39,024 --> 00:11:04,272
..or else I'll be really mad.

105
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,024
I don't want to do it...

106
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:07,044
Okay okay fine.. one time.

107
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:35,854
i'll teach you

108
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,006
Hello? Yi Jung.

109
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:42,038
Mmm. How are you ?

110
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:45,084
I'm great. Hey you. Don't you want to see your older brother ?

111
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:50,014
I know you're busy and all, but it'd be nice to see your face once in a while.

112
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:53,028
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:58,004
It sounds like you're in a good mood.

114
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:09,147
I am. If you're curious, stop by. I have someone to show you. And stories to tell, too.

115
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:12,347
Someone to show me ?

116
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:13,084
You'll probably be really shocked to see her.

117
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:24,363
And happy, too! I can't wait till you meet her, little bro!

118
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:32,174
Hyung..

119
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:41,439
You're... happy, right?

120
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:54,169
Yeah. I'm sorry I'm happy by myself.

121
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:54,874
Yi Jung?

122
00:12:54,874 --> 00:13:53,754
Yi Jung?

123
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:56,006
Hey Monkey..

124
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,265
What is all this ?

125
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:01,042
Hello everyone !

126
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:05,084
I'm Ha JaeKyung. I'll be staying in this house from now on for pre-marriage preparations.

127
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:44,002
What?

128
00:14:44,002 --> 00:15:11,433
- Madam Chairman- Is it ready?

129
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,634
What is this about?

130
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:18,695
After discussing with Jaekyung's parents, we thought it'd be a good idea to push up the wedding date.

131
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:22,701
You are both adults, and it'd be best for both of our businesses

132
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:28,177
to continue on with the partnership if you two are already married.

133
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,008
How can you do this without our consent ?

134
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:33,376
I agreed with them.

135
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,126
What?

136
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:40,032
Jaekyung will stay at our house until the wedding day.

137
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:41,692
She wanted to get adjusted to the air,

138
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,402
and get ready to be your wife.

139
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,057
the thought was so sweet

140
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:51,076
that her parents and I both approved.

141
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,369
Also?

142
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,073
Yes..

143
00:15:55,073 --> 00:16:01,006
The two to-be-married will have to shoot the Shin Hwa phone commercial together.

144
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:04,543
What ?

145
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,194
Who agreed to that?

146
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:09,004
The two of you together at the phone launching

147
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,006
were so lovely

148
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:14,192
that you two became a hot topic on the internet and magazines.

149
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,574
The marketing team decided that you two

150
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:24,088
could only be the best choice to advertise the phone.

151
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:29,078
Jaekyung, I'm sorry to have to make you work, but you could help us out, right ?

152
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,000
Of course. It's my honor.

153
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,594
I... I can't accept this!

154
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,048
JunPyo..

155
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,691
Give and take.

156
00:16:38,691 --> 00:17:38,056
You haven't fogotten the basics of business, right ?

157
00:17:38,056 --> 00:18:13,056
"Can you come to my room for a bit?" - Jaekyung

158
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:18,104
How do i look?

159
00:18:18,104 --> 00:18:20,726
Pretty..

160
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,086
It's really pretty.

161
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:25,014
Junpyo's mother gave me this.

162
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:29,004
It's over 20 years old, but I think it'll still work.

163
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:30,052
I might just wear this.

164
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:43,084
Wait... look at this too.

165
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:45,824
She says she won't give me the pearls yet.

166
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,024
She told me she'd give them to me when we have our first kid.

167
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:50,631
Heh- Don't you think she's getting a little ahead of herself?

168
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,703
But it's pretty funny to think about...

169
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:59,335
a kid that looks like Gu Junpyo and Ha Jaekyung.

170
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:01,372
Jan Di..

171
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,828
I have a request.

172
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:04,082
What is it?

173
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:13,941
You have to promise me that you'll do it, first.

174
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:17,751
Be my maid of honor.

175
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,235
What?

176
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:20,546
It can't be anyone else.

177
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,602
It has to be Jandi.

178
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:41,044
You'll do it, right ? Hmm ?

179
00:19:41,044 --> 00:21:02,685
action, take 1

180
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:05,095
You can't use those in the winter.

181
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:25,542
Use worms.

182
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:33,953
Its served me well over the years.Take it.

183
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:43,703
Do you want to come?

184
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:55,197
I'll leave in ten minutes.

185
00:21:55,197 --> 00:22:11,446
Hey, Ji....oh, wait...

186
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:24,115
Your mom made one mean spicy fish stew.

187
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:47,991
Today is their wedding anniversary.

188
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,079
I still remember very clearly...

189
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,592
...giving that to your grandmother and putting it on...

190
00:22:55,592 --> 00:23:00,869
...and her smile was so bright.

191
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:07,191
I asked what was so great about receiving that old cheap ring...

192
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:18,084
...she said, "It's the only one in the world...why wouldn't I be happy?"

193
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:23,021
Child...

194
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:25,581
I'm sorry.

195
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:32,294
I took away that kind of a mother from you.

196
00:23:32,294 --> 00:24:01,369
All because of my karma.

197
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,772
What are you planning on doing?

198
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:07,899
I don't know either.

199
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:12,783
It feels like a bomb went off in my head and everything is scrambled...

200
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,091
What should I do?

201
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:16,363
What is it that I can do?

202
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:19,263
You have to find a way.

203
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:25,767
Only you can find a solution.

204
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,831
If this was like the past

205
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:32,047
The solution of course would be to marry her.

206
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:34,061
How is it that we have become ones who....

207
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:54,058
...question and worry about our definite solution?

208
00:24:54,058 --> 00:25:20,745
It looks like we're going to end up being groomsmen...

209
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:21,091
Are you okay?

210
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:23,019
About what?

211
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:25,248
You know what.

212
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,513
Jandi, this time it's a real marriage.

213
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:51,475
You know that marriage is different from dating for a few days and breaking up.

214
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:54,091
That's the future of those two people.

215
00:25:54,091 --> 00:26:06,006
And that's the place Junpyo's supposed to fill.

216
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:10,152
Hi, mom and dad. You guys are doing well, right?

217
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,556
San too?

218
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:15,051
What?!

219
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:27,051
You should be eating well! What are you going to do getting sick?!

220
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:31,155
Don't worry about me.

221
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:37,023
Please take care of your health.

222
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:38,495
Don't be so frugal and cheap either...

223
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:42,047
Buy and eat some meat, too.

224
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:45,862
Understand?

225
00:26:45,862 --> 00:27:08,035
Okay.

226
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:12,043
Yes, grandfather?

227
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:30,035
Right now?

228
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:33,979
Oh, I'm sor-

229
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,079
What's going on?

230
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,439
Sunbae - why are you here?

231
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,223
Me? Grandfat-

232
00:27:40,223 --> 00:28:59,112
Me too.

233
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,035
Excuse me. What are they doing?

234
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:03,059
The Couple Wedding Contest.

235
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,008
They said they'd give you a prize if you win.

236
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:11,181
You can also wear a wedding dress for free.

237
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:22,832
Prize?

238
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:28,047
I said to take care of your health.

239
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,012
Don't try saving money.

240
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:37,767
Eat some meat too.

241
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,927
1st Prize: Jeju Island Travel Tickets 2nd Prize: Korean Beef set, 3rd Prize: Ance Treatment

242
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:45,166
We're bored. Want to give it a try?

243
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,054
What?

244
00:29:46,054 --> 00:30:33,728
Let's go.

245
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,392
Please smile and make a pose.

246
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:50,237
Okay. One, two...

247
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:54,286
Okay, next couple.

248
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,839
Okay. One...Move a little closer.

249
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:07,099
Make it more natural.

250
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:56,027
<i>chant</i> Kiss! Kiss!

251
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,574
Ah, Sunbae...

252
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:02,067
Excuse me, but this is a plane ticket to Jeju Island. Would you mind exchanging gifts?

253
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:03,772
Not at all.

254
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:05,007
Thank you.

255
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,515
Please take it.

256
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:11,015
Thank you.

257
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:14,508
Here.

258
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:23,075
SUNBAE!!!

259
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,506
Thank you. Thank you.

260
00:32:25,506 --> 00:34:12,993
Thank you..Thank you.

261
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:17,399
Dear Passengers, we will be arriving shortly at Jeju International Airport.

262
00:34:17,399 --> 00:35:47,522
Please stow away your tray tables and fasten your seatbelts.

263
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:50,003
Are you okay?

264
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:53,066
So, days like this really do come, huh?

265
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,829
Jandi came with us.

266
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,892
Does any of this makes sense?

267
00:35:57,892 --> 00:36:02,807
Whether the monkey asked her to be the maid of honor...

268
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:06,826
or the girl that accepted it.

269
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:40,941
Who do you think is having the hardest time right now?

270
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:44,312
JanDi,

271
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:46,028
You came

272
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:49,328
You really came..

273
00:36:49,328 --> 00:37:07,434
Thank you.

274
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:18,264
I know... that You and JunPyo really liked each other

275
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:21,364
Jaekyung..

276
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:37,264
Wait no.. Even right now. . .I don't know if you still like each other...

277
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:42,147
I'm sorry i pretended to not know.

278
00:37:42,147 --> 00:37:46,306
I'm not usually like this

279
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,958
I was a little disloyal and cowardly towards you.

280
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,749
its not that...

281
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:57,718
It was because I didn't come out honestly and tell you.

282
00:37:57,718 --> 00:38:00,454
you're right..

283
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:04,591
it wasn't that you didn't want to.. it was because you couldn't..

284
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,807
and..

285
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:09,363
even if you had told me...

286
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:14,167
i'm sure nothing would have changed..

287
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:31,151
I... wouldn't have given up on JunPyo

288
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:36,957
I... really do like you a lot.

289
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:43,173
If someone told me to pick the two most precious people in the world to me....

290
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:46,278
I would say Gu JunPyo and Geum JanDi.

291
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:49,436
Jaekyung..

292
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:55,073
therefore... i'm really sorry.

293
00:38:55,073 --> 00:39:01,552
because i made your heart ache.. but i'll make it up to you somehow

294
00:39:01,552 --> 00:40:44,184
Please forgive me..

295
00:40:44,184 --> 00:40:46,219
Hey..JunPyo..

296
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,852
stop playing and come here

297
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:49,856
You're going to faint that way.

298
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:52,159
He actually might be trying to faint.

299
00:40:52,159 --> 00:41:12,312
Are we really supposed to let him do that?

300
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:15,882
How did you end up breaking up with him?

301
00:41:15,882 --> 00:41:17,617
Who knows...

302
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:18,619
how did we break up?

303
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:25,725
You asked if I confessed, right?

304
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:30,023
I did confess.

305
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:31,933
Just once...

306
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:34,834
i gathered up all my courage for 10 years worth of feelings

307
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:37,737
that i had been carrying around

308
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:42,268
It was on Valentine's day.

309
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:46,058
Believing that if we were destined, that how I truly felt would be understood...

310
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:53,186
I put everything on the line.

311
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:55,922
So how did it turn out?

312
00:41:55,922 --> 00:42:00,026
I wasn't able to get it through to that person

313
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:04,013
my feelings that is

314
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:06,166
the amazing thing is..

315
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:10,337
After i did that..My heart was completely emptied.

316
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:13,974
just like how the low tide drifts away

317
00:42:13,974 --> 00:42:17,777
I thought alright...it's up to this point.

318
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:24,918
As i felt us being combed through, it was almost to the point where i felt like i could almost touch that feeling

319
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:29,389
It felt like solving a math problem that i had been working on for a very long time.

320
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:30,657
I felt it was for the better

321
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:32,707
and it didn't hurt afterwards?

322
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:34,794
I've done everything i could without any regrets

323
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:39,366
so it didn't really hurt

324
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:48,074
So Ga-Eul...keep trying until you have no regrets.

325
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:51,511
Isn't the situation too serious for you to be playing in the flower field?

326
00:42:51,511 --> 00:43:01,116
isn't the situation too serious for you to be playing in the flower field?

327
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:06,021
At this age...a marriage of convenience...

328
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:08,613
it doesn't seem real

329
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,065
In our world

330
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:13,054
It's not something to be surprised by.

331
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:14,601
Sunbae too...

332
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,437
Do you accept this kind of future as well?

333
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:19,271
Who knows...

334
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,805
Whether it's this kind of future or that kind of future

335
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:25,436
neither one looks too different from the other

336
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,884
How can you be so irresponsible about your one and only life?..

337
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:36,747
Because you're like this, no one can stay by your side.

338
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,491
Now that you know about my family and my weaknesses...

339
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:45,681
Is that why you're acting as if you knew everything?

340
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:53,139
Why on earth didn't you come to see her?

341
00:43:53,139 --> 00:44:31,177
On the Valentine day 3 years ago

342
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:54,868
it's getting cold. we should go inside.

343
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:59,111
today might be your last chance..

344
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:02,575
JunPyo,

345
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:03,734
if you want to hang onto him..

346
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:12,318
there's no time.

347
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,622
Ever since i got to know you, I hoped for

348
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:19,726
only one thing.

349
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:21,863
That you'll become happy

350
00:45:21,863 --> 00:45:24,364
and won't cry anymore.

351
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:27,976
Like the first time we met

352
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,738
smiling brightly.

353
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:36,042
When tomorrow passes, you might not smile anymore.

354
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:40,019
That scares me.

355
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:45,752
Please don't worry..

356
00:45:45,752 --> 00:45:46,993
I can smile.

357
00:45:46,993 --> 00:45:52,392
i will smile.

358
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:56,093
Because Senior...

359
00:45:56,093 --> 00:46:06,306
Is watching over me.

360
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:09,615
I think i got hit by the wind a lot..

361
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:26,659
my eyes are salty.

362
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:31,864
I'm okay.

363
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:36,202
My tears so used to be wiped away by you Sunbae..

364
00:46:36,202 --> 00:47:39,132
that's why they keep stupidly falling like this

365
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:40,833
whoa, you surprised me!

366
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:41,801
What are you doing?!

367
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:43,736
Who says I'm doing something?

368
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,371
this girl really..

369
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:48,274
There's no use glaring at me like that.

370
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:50,317
Because starting from tomorrow you're mine.

371
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:51,844
Yours?! Who's yours?

372
00:47:51,844 --> 00:47:53,813
Stop whining and come downstairs.

373
00:47:53,813 --> 00:48:19,706
The adults are waiting.

374
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:21,774
Starting tomorrow, we're really going to be one family.

375
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,977
I guess so.

376
00:48:24,977 --> 00:48:26,183
Shinhwa and JK

377
00:48:26,183 --> 00:49:37,065
And for our children's happiness, let's make a toast.

378
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:42,022
What are you doing hiding in here?

379
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,289
Noona..

380
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:45,558
When did you come?

381
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:47,111
There's no need to tell anyone

382
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:50,229
Since I'm not here for your wedding.

383
00:49:50,229 --> 00:49:53,566
I know. Aren't I pathetic?

384
00:49:53,566 --> 00:49:54,934
Goo JunPyo.

385
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:59,989
I'm asking how far you're willing to take this?

386
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:01,073
How far does that need to be?

387
00:50:01,073 --> 00:50:03,543
Everything.

388
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,788
Family, Shinhwa Group.

389
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:16,655
And even Gu Junpyo, your name.

390
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:20,339
I wasn't able to.

391
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,161
When I threw everything away

392
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:24,931
What would Gu Junhui become?

393
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:28,437
To live my life as a nobody, and only being known as one man's woman

394
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:31,304
I didn't have the courage to do that.

395
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:34,073
Noona..

396
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,926
From that one incident that i was a coward for...

397
00:50:36,926 --> 00:50:41,514
it played its toll on me and made things hard.

398
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:46,722
I thought I could forget it. But I couldn't.

399
00:50:46,722 --> 00:50:53,125
Are you still apologetic to that person?

400
00:50:53,125 --> 00:51:00,366
No. It's not him I feel sorry towards...

401
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:04,837
It's to whom I thought would always be genuine and justified

402
00:51:04,837 --> 00:51:17,181
20 year old Gu JunHee.

403
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:21,821
Little brother. No matter what you decide to do....

404
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:24,357
I'm going to understand.

405
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:27,827
And no matter what you do, or where you do it

406
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:29,746
You'll always be the little brother Gu Jun Pyo

407
00:51:29,746 --> 00:52:25,099
that I love... and it'll never change.

408
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,398
JiHoo. Just say it.

409
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:32,283
To me, you're my brother.

410
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:39,806
In the past and even in the future.

411
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:43,836
But sometimes I think ...

412
00:52:43,836 --> 00:52:47,406
You would probably live well without me.

413
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:50,977
But what will I do without you?

414
00:52:50,977 --> 00:52:51,944
Could you be...

415
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:57,146
You're not asking me to help you run away tomorrow

416
00:52:57,146 --> 00:53:06,822
Are you?

417
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:08,302
Hit me just once.

418
00:53:08,302 --> 00:53:09,743
What?

419
00:53:09,743 --> 00:53:12,307
This isn't a joke.

420
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:13,684
I have to take a hit from you.

421
00:53:13,684 --> 00:53:35,017
JoonPyo . . .

422
00:53:35,017 --> 00:53:38,003
JanDi . . .

423
00:53:38,003 --> 00:53:43,959
I can't let her go.

424
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:45,631
Which one do you think is better?

425
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:49,837
This one or this one?

426
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:51,934
They're all pretty.

427
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:53,736
You can't say that.

428
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:58,007
You have to tell the bride one hundred percent coldly and truthfully as the BFF of the bride.

429
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:02,745
If you say you like them all, it doesn't help.

430
00:54:02,745 --> 00:54:04,379
Sorry,

431
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:21,023
but, all of them really are pretty.

432
00:54:21,023 --> 00:55:29,031
I have something to say.

433
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:32,042
Ah, ah.

434
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:37,227
Do you, bride, Ha JaeKyung, take groom, Goo JoonPyo.

435
00:55:37,227 --> 00:55:41,615
As your husband, in times of happiness and sadness

436
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:46,114
As long as you both shall live?

437
00:55:46,114 --> 00:55:48,072
Yes, I do.

438
00:55:48,072 --> 00:55:53,656
Do you, groom Goo JoonPyo take bride Ha JaeKyung as your wife

439
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:56,593
In sickness and in health

440
00:55:56,593 --> 00:56:04,942
And love each other as long as you both shall live?

441
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:09,705
I can't.

442
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:17,279
I can't do it.

443
00:56:17,279 --> 00:56:19,381
Goo JoonPyo.

444
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:21,951
This is just for fun.

445
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:23,652
Why are you so serious?

446
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:26,155
I'm not joking, Monkey.

447
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:32,084
No . . .

448
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:35,767
Ha JaeKyung,

449
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,967
We can't get married.

450
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:40,502
Joon.

451
00:56:40,502 --> 00:56:44,173
I'm sorry.

452
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:45,407
If sorry was enough . . .

453
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:54,383
...then why are there laws and why are there police?

454
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:57,686
There's a girl I love,

455
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:00,856
The first since I was born.

456
00:57:00,856 --> 00:57:03,058
And until the day I die,

457
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:08,472
she's the only one.

458
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:12,619
do you still want to marry me?...

459
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:13,535
Yes.

460
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:16,572
Are you out of your mind?

461
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:22,177
I know. That girl is Geum JanDi.

462
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:25,781
But . . .

463
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:32,187
I want you and I want to continue.

464
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:39,063
It might be funny, but I like you because you're single-minded.

465
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:42,301
Because you're a man who knows how to love properly,

466
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:45,467
I like you more.

467
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:48,737
The fact that it's Geum JanDi,

468
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:52,241
I can endure it.

469
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:54,376
I know you won't forget her easily.

470
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:56,211
But

471
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:58,681
I will wait.

472
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:02,785
If I wait and see . . .

473
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:03,886
next time,

474
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:05,367
there might be a chance for me.

475
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:07,692
That you will love me like you love her.

476
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:12,211
Ha Jaekyung

477
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:13,308
That's all I need.

478
00:58:13,308 --> 00:58:34,911
It's worth the investment for me.

479
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,707
Goo JunPyo

480
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:40,423
Forgive me.

481
00:58:40,423 --> 00:58:44,093
I don't want to.

482
00:58:44,093 --> 00:58:46,662
Listen well.

483
00:58:46,662 --> 00:58:50,099
We are going to be husband and wife in this place tomorrow.

484
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,601
No matter what,

485
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,004
until the day we die

486
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:58,674
we're going to promise to love each other.

487
00:58:58,674 --> 00:59:05,214
Even though you are pleading with me to forgive you,

488
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:14,618
there's nothing for me to forgive.

489
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:18,458
It's late already.

490
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:23,029
They begged me to go to bed early tonight so my make-up will take tomorrow.

491
00:59:23,029 --> 01:00:34,242
I'll be going first.

492
01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:37,239
It's almost time

493
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:49,015
You'd better come out.

494
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:51,453
WooBin.

495
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:52,733
I have a favor to ask

496
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:54,156
What's it?

497
01:00:54,156 --> 01:00:56,247
Please break my arm!

498
01:00:56,247 --> 01:00:57,626
What?!

499
01:00:57,626 --> 01:00:59,495
JunPyo.

500
01:00:59,495 --> 01:01:03,131
There's no time

501
01:01:03,131 --> 01:01:05,267
With your skill, you can do it in one blow.

502
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:23,498
Are you serious?

503
01:01:23,498 --> 01:01:32,727
What are you doing right now ?

504
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:34,629
Don't worry about it. Go outside.

505
01:01:34,629 --> 01:01:39,468
Is that all you could come up with?

506
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:41,539
If that is the only way to stop the wedding,

507
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:43,005
then it's better if you just go ahead with it.

508
01:01:43,005 --> 01:01:44,206
Geum JanDi

509
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:45,907
You're a coward!

510
01:01:45,907 --> 01:01:48,543
You're not being dignified in front of anyone.

511
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:52,753
You're not facing it, you're just running away!

512
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:55,449
If you run away like this

513
01:01:55,449 --> 01:02:00,556
someday, it might happen again.

514
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:03,826
Then tell me not to do it!

515
01:02:03,826 --> 01:02:52,243
Tell me not to go!

516
01:02:52,243 --> 01:03:02,823
Say something!

517
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:13,638
- We have to shoot it again.- Do I have to go up there?

518
01:03:13,638 --> 01:03:33,482
Wait a minute!

519
01:03:33,482 --> 99:59:59,999
Did I fall asleep? Did you shoot that?

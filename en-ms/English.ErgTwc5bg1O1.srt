1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,610
A club of nine people wants
to choose a board of three

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,940
officers: a President, a Vice
President, and a Secretary.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,370
How many ways are there
to choose the board

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,430
from the nine people?

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,680
Now, we're going to assume that
one person can't hold

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,760
more than one office.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,910
That if I'm picked for
President, then I'm no longer

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,810
a valid person for Vice
President or Secretary.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,460
So let's just think about the
three different positions.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,750
So you have the President, you
have the Vice President, VP,

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,000
and then you have
the Secretary.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,340

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,840
Now, let's say that we go for
the President first. It

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,950
actually doesn't matter.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,460
Let's say we were picking the
President slot first and we

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,160
haven't appointed any
other slots yet.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,580
How many possibilities are
there for President?

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,360
Well, the club has nine people,
so there's nine

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,990
possibilities for President.

21
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,950
There's going to be nine
possibilities for President.

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,090
Now, we're going to pick
one of those nine.

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,200
We're going to kind of take them
out of the running for

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,590
the other two offices.

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,900
Right?

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,890
Because someone's going to be
President, so one of the nine

27
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,650
is going to be President.

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,300
There's nine possibilities, but
one of the nine is going

29
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,260
to be President.

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,130
So you take that person aside.

31
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,750
He or she is now
the President.

32
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,000
How many people are left
to be Vice President?

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,190
Well, now there's only
eight possible

34
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,510
candidates for Vice President?

35
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,900
Eight possibilities.

36
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,990
Now he or she also goes aside.

37
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,390
Now how many people are
left for Secretary?

38
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,210
Well, now there's only seven
possibilities for Secretary.

39
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,720
So if you want to think about
all of the different ways

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,170
there are to choose a board from
the nine people, there's

41
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,550
the 9 for President times the 8
for Vice President times the

42
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,510
7 for Secretary.

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,450
You didn't have to
do it this way.

44
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,990
It could've been-- you could've
picked Secretary

45
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,890
first. Then there would've
been nine choices.

46
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,100
And then you could've picked
Vice President, and there

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
would've still been
eight choices.

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,680
And then you could've picked
President last, and there

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,800
would've only been
seven choices.

50
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,430
But either way you would've
got 9 times 8 times 7.

51
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:04,400
And that is, let's see, 9 times
8 is 72 times 7 is-- 2

52
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,130
times 7 is 14, 7 times
7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.

53
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,670
So 504 possible ways to pick
your board out of a club of

54
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,790
only nine people.

55
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,333

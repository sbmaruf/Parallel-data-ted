1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,900
The owner of a restaurant
wants to find out more about

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,020
where his patrons
are coming from.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,680
One day, he decided
to gather data

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,780
about the distance
in miles that people

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,780
commuted to get
to his restaurant.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,690
People reported the
following distances traveled.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,770
So this is our data
right over here.

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,200
He wants to create a graph
that helps them understand

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,840
the spread of the distances
and the median distance

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,050
that people travel.

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,640
What kind of a graph
should he create?

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,600
And you can plot this data in
many different types of graphs,

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,690
but they tend to depict
things in different ways.

14
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,510
For example, a line graph
shows a trend over time.

15
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:36,222
He's not interested
in a trend over time,

16
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,680
so a line graph
doesn't make sense.

17
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:40,808
Or a line graph could be a trend
of one variable with respect

18
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,637
to another variable.

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,970
It doesn't just have to be time.

20
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:44,653
But he doesn't want
to see a trend here.

21
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,230
A bar graph is good
when you're trying

22
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,053
to bucket things, put
things into buckets

23
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,440
and see how those
buckets are performing.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,820
Once again, that's not
exactly what he wants to see.

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,490
A pie graph, if you
want to see kind

26
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,420
of how things make up a whole.

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,080
That's not what he wants
to see right over here.

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,110
A stem and leaf plot does
help with distributions

29
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,571
a little bit, but
it really doesn't

30
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,869
tackle the median distance and
the spread really, really well.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,650
So the one that
does, and especially

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,550
when people talk about
medians and spread,

33
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,490
is a box and whiskers plot.

34
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,202
And I'll show you how
to do it right now.

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,180
Box and whiskers.

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,630
And what a box and whisker
plot literally does

37
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,620
is it shows the
spread of the data.

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,080
It splits it into quartiles.

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,619
And I'll talk about
that in a second.

40
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,410
And it also tells you where the
median of the data actually is.

41
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,199
And that's one of the
things that the owner

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,800
of the restaurant cares about.

43
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,512
So whenever you're
dealing with medians--

44
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,720
and box and whisker plots deal
with medians-- the first thing

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,430
you want to do is
order all the numbers

46
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,560
because the median is really
the middle number when

47
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:41,935
you order them all up.

48
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,050
So let's order this.

49
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,250
So let's write it in order.

50
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,600
So first we have 1.

51
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,030
So we get rid of that 1.

52
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,290
Then we have one
2 right over here.

53
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,490
And then we have another
2 right over there.

54
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,890
That's all of our 2's.

55
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,480
Then we have this 3, that
3, and then we have that 3.

56
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,231
So those are two people
who have to travel

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,760
3 miles to the restaurant.

58
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,222
Then let's see, do
we have any 4's?

59
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,400
We have one 4 right over there.

60
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,740
And then we have another
4 right over there.

61
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,920
Then, let's see,
do we have any 5's?

62
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,530
Actually, I just realized
that I skipped one of the 1's.

63
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,992
We have another 1
right over there.

64
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,380
So let's write that
1 right over there.

65
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,030
We actually had two 1's.

66
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:23,819
And then let's see.

67
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,140
Do we have any 5's?

68
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,900
We do not have
any 5's over here.

69
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,890
Do we have any 6's?

70
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,630
We have one 6 right over here.

71
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,290
And then we have no more 6's.

72
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,880
Do we have any 7's?

73
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,950
We have one 7 right over there.

74
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,920
8's.

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,600
We have an 8 right over there
and that's the only one.

76
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,101
Let's see.

77
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,510
Do we have any 9's?

78
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,650
No 9's.

79
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,510
Any 10's?

80
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,870
Yes, we have a 10.

81
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,900
Do we have an 11?

82
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,040
Yep.

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,250
11.

84
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,160
Do we have any 12's?

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,470
No 12's, no 13's.

86
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,830
14?

87
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,636
14.

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,680
And we have a 15.

89
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,100
People must like
this restaurant.

90
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,310
They're traveling a good bit.

91
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,728
Then we have a 20 and
then we have a 22.

92
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,080
So I've ordered all the numbers.

93
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,070
Let me make sure I
haven't skipped or gotten

94
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,770
some duplicates.

95
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:18,580
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

96
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,630
17 people were surveyed, 17
patrons of the restaurant.

97
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,330
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

98
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,090
16, 17.

99
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,590
All right.

100
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,180
Seems like I've got all of
them and I've ordered them now.

101
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,690
Now the median is
the middle number.

102
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,310
We just said that we
had 17 of these numbers.

103
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,150
So we want the
number-- and since it's

104
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,240
an odd number of numbers,
the median actually

105
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:44,452
will be one of these numbers.

106
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,920
It's actually the middle number.

107
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,980
It'll be the number
where eight are larger

108
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,040
and eight are smaller.

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,560
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

110
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,540
So it looks like
this is our median.

111
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:56,714
It will be the ninth number.

112
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,710
And then you have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 that are larger.

113
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,460
So eight are smaller than
6, eight are larger than 6.

114
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,550
So 6 is the middle number.

115
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,410
If we had an even
number of numbers here,

116
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,630
if we had two middle
numbers, then we

117
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,919
would take the average of them.

118
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,690
When you have an odd
number of data points,

119
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,266
then you can just
take the middle one.

120
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,979
So this one right over
here is our median.

121
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:23,144
And then when you do a box
plot, what you want to do

122
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,040
is you want to find the
median of the set of numbers

123
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,280
that are smaller
than the median.

124
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,900
And you also want to find the
median of the set of numbers

125
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,790
that are larger than the median.

126
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,600
These are called
the first quartile

127
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
and the second quartile.

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,480
Because when you do
that, you split your data

129
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:40,315
into four sections,
or quartiles.

130
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,350
"Quar," you'd normally
associate with four.

131
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,180
So let's look at the set
that's smaller than 6.

132
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,850
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers.

133
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,750
So it's an eight.

134
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,289
If you have eight
data points, you're

135
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,510
going to actually have
two middle numbers.

136
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,010
So for example, you have
these two right over here

137
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,830
are the two middle numbers--
three less, three more.

138
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,960
You can't just pick the
2 because if you just

139
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
picked the 2, you'd have
three less and four more.

140
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:09,284
And you can't just pick
the 3 because then you

141
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,390
would have three
more and four less.

142
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,140
So these are our
middle two numbers.

143
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,940
So the median of this group
right over here is 2.5.

144
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,390
I averaged these
middle two numbers.

145
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,550
And then let's do it over
here with this group.

146
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,540
I'll do it in blue.

147
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,470
So once again, we
have eight numbers.

148
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,860
You're going to
have two middles.

149
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,870
And so it's going to be the
third and the fourth number,

150
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,150
which is 11 and 14.

151
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,460
And if you average 11
and 14-- let's see.

152
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,130
11 plus 14 is 25, divided
by 2 is 12.5, is 12.5.

153
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,730
So this essentially divides
the data into four sections.

154
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,700
You have everything up
to this first quartile.

155
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,750
So you have this first
section right over here,

156
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,540
this first median of the
lower half of the data is 2.5.

157
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,010
Then you have everything between
2.5 and 6, then 6 to 12.5,

158
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,390
and then everything
more than 12.5.

159
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,050
And so what a box
and whisker plot

160
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,370
is essentially a
graphical depiction

161
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,680
of this right over here.

162
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,030
So let's do that.

163
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,010
I'm going to set
up a number line.

164
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,990
So let me draw a number line
as straight as possible.

165
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,730
So let's say that
is my number line.

166
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,340
And let's say that this is 0.

167
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,700
And let's say that this
is-- I want to make it.

168
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,310
So let's say that this is 10.

169
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,740
And then this would be 20.

170
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,920
And then this would be 5.

171
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,070
This would be-- let me do it a
little bit cleaner than that.

172
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,630
This would be 15.

173
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,270
25 would be right around there.

174
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,530
So first thing on the
box and whiskers plot,

175
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,360
you want to show the
entire range of data.

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,060
So our smallest data
point starts at 1.

177
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,300
So 1 is right about here.

178
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,100
So if I do-- so this is 2.5.

179
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,620
So 1 is right about here.

180
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,700
And then our largest
data point is 22.

181
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,480
22 would sit right about there.

182
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,520
And I'll even label
it, although you often

183
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,850
won't see it labeled like that.

184
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,760
That's 1.

185
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,330
And then that is 22.

186
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,140
And then the middle half of
the data, we do with a box.

187
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,190
So the middle half
is this quartile

188
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,650
and this quartile
right over there.

189
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,960
So the second quartile
starts at 2.5.

190
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,410
So 2.5 is right there.

191
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,100
So this is where we
start our box, 2.5.

192
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,780
And then our third
quartile starts at 12.5.

193
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,560
So 12.5 is right over there.

194
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,320
12.5 is right over there.

195
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,620
And then we can draw a box.

196
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,159
I'll draw the box
in a neutral color.

197
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,650
I'll do it actually
in that yellow color.

198
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,160
So let me draw the box here.

199
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,760
So the box shows where the
middle half of our data is.

200
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,040
And now I can draw
these two arrows, these.

201
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,220
So that's the box part.

202
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,644
And then these two
arrows are what

203
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,530
you would call the whiskers.

204
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,350
And that shows where
all the other data is.

205
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,320
So it's really showing
the spread of the data.

206
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,480
And then the last thing we need
to show is the actual median.

207
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,130
And the median-- I'll do it in
purple-- we already figured out

208
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,250
is 6.

209
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,980
So the median sits right
about-- see, this is 5.

210
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,780
This would 7.5.

211
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,070
6 would be right over there.

212
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,790
So with this one
diagram, you've actually

213
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,700
depicted all of this
information in terms

214
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,390
of where is the median.

215
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,130
The median is at 6.

216
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,050
That is 6 right over there.

217
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,910
Where is the middle
half of the data?

218
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:29,600
Well, it's between 2.5 and
12.5, between 2.5 and 12.5.

219
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,230
And all of the data, the entire
spread for all of the customers

220
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,610
sits between-- and this is
what the whiskers do for us.

221
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,710
It sits between 1 and
it sits between 22.

222
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:43,036
And if you wanted to color
code it a little bit better--

223
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,489
let me do that just
because it's fun.

224
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,030
So this data right
over here-- and really,

225
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,690
if you think about it, it's
including this data too.

226
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,800
That's what this
whisker is depicting.

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,900
This data right over-- Let me
do that in a different color.

228
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,540
This data right
over here is kind

229
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,080
of the first half of the box.

230
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,157
That data right over here.

231
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,490
Then you have your
median in magenta.

232
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,030
Then this data right over here
is the second part of the box.

233
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,090
So it's all of this
stuff right over here.

234
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,370
And then finally, let
me pick a new color

235
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,330
that I haven't used yet.

236
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,980
This data is kind of
represented by this part,

237
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,530
by this whisker right over here.

238
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,242
Now there's one thing
I want to leave you

239
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,700
with is that I used a method for
this box and whisker diagram.

240
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,960
I found the median.

241
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,870
I use a method where the two
halves, I got rid of the median

242
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,460
and I found the
median of this part,

243
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,960
and I found the
median of that part.

244
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,379
And that's the
more typical method

245
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,050
for box and whisker plots.

246
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,010
Sometimes when you find
the median of the lower

247
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,920
half and the upper
half, some people

248
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,580
will include this median in both
sets when they calculate it.

249
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,619
But I just want to let
you know that's out there.

250
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,160
But the way that I
did it is actually

251
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,201
the more mainstream way.

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,570
That's the way most
calculators, I believe,

253
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,870
actually will do a
box and whisker plot.

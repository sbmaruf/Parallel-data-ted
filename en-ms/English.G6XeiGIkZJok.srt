1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570


2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,420
Complete this statement using
less than or greater than--

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,850
that's what those symbols
are-- for this kind of

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,029
brackets there.

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,780
So all they're asking is they
have a 5 and they have a 2,

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,740
and they want us to put either
a less than sign for these

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,500
brackets or a greater
than sign.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,400
So we just have a 5 and
a 2, and we're just

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,660
comparing the two.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,250
Which number is greater?

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,540
Well, 5 is greater.

12
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,630
If you count to 5, you're
going to pass up 2.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,690
If you look at a number line
here, if you started at 0, 1,

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,460
2, 3, 4, 5, you see that
2 comes before 5.

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,120
2 is less than 5.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,310
If I have $2, that's less than
$5, or $5 is greater than $2.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,450
And so the symbol for greater
than, the way you remember

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,910
it-- this is probably the
hardest part of how do you

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,050
remember it-- is you want the
larger side of the symbol

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,360
facing the larger number.

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,830
So 5 is the larger number,
so we want the

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,460
bigger side of the symbol.

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,860
So we want it like this.

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,040
The way I think about is that
this right here is the big

25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,980
side of the symbol, and this
right here, this point, is the

26
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,110
small side of the symbol,
so 5 is greater than 2.

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,800
If it was the other way, we
would write 2 is less than 5.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,860
Once again, though, we always
have the point pointing to the

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,090
smaller number, and we have the
wide-open part, the big

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,650
part of the symbol, pointing
to the larger number.

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,267

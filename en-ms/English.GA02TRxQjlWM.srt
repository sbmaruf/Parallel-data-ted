1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,240
We already know that the
sum of the interior angles

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,560
of a triangle add
up to 180 degrees.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,415
So if the measure
of this angle is a,

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:10,460
the measure of this
angle over here is b,

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,940
and the measure of
this angle is c,

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,030
we know that a plus b plus
c is equal to 180 degrees.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,800
But what happens
when we have polygons

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,300
with more than three sides?

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
So let's try the
case where we have

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,300
a four-sided polygon--
a quadrilateral.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,120
And I am going to
make it irregular just

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,600
to show that whatever we
do here it probably applies

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,270
to any quadrilateral
with four sides.

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,282
Not just things that have right
angles, and parallel lines,

16
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:35,990
and all the rest.

17
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,910
Actually, that
looks a little bit

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,250
too close to being parallel.

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,416
So let me draw it like this.

20
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,475

21
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,350
So the way you can think
about it with a four

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,090
sided quadrilateral,
is well we already

23
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,970
know about this-- the measures
of the interior angles

24
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,680
of a triangle add up to 180.

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,820
So maybe we can divide
this into two triangles.

26
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,830
So from this point
right over here,

27
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,620
if we draw a line
like this, we've

28
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,970
divided it into two triangles.

29
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,550
And so if the measure this
angle is a, measure of this

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,580
is b, measure of
that is c, we know

31
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,540
that a plus b plus c is
equal to 180 degrees.

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,310
And then if we call this over
here x, this over here y,

33
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,530
and that z, those are the
measures of those angles.

34
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,232
We know that x plus y plus
z is equal to 180 degrees.

35
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:23,190
And so if we want the
measure of the sum of all

36
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,830
of the interior angles,
all of the interior angles

37
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,050
are going to be
b plus z-- that's

38
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,270
two of the interior
angles of this polygon--

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,000
plus this angle, which is
just going to be a plus x.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,860
a plus x is that whole angle.

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,040
The whole angle for
the quadrilateral.

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,927
Plus this whole angle, which
is going to be c plus y.

43
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,570

44
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,185
And we already know a plus
b plus c is 180 degrees.

45
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:57,420

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,370
And we know that z plus x plus
y is equal to 180 degrees.

47
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,322
So plus 180 degrees, which
is equal to 360 degrees.

48
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:10,030
So I think you see
the general idea here.

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,680
We just have to figure out how
many triangles we can divide

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,760
something into, and then we
just multiply by 180 degrees

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,160
since each of those triangles
will have 180 degrees.

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,210
Let's do one more
particular example.

53
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,461
And then we'll try to do a
general version where we're

54
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,585
just trying to figure out
how many triangles can we

55
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,630
fit into that thing.

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,760
So let me draw an
irregular pentagon.

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,070
So one, two, three, four, five.

58
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,820
So it looks like a little bit
of a sideways house there.

59
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,260
Once again, we can draw
our triangles inside

60
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,640
of this pentagon.

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
So that would be
one triangle there.

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,020
That would be another triangle.

63
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,740
So I'm able to draw three
non-overlapping triangles that

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,350
perfectly cover this pentagon.

65
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,122
This is one triangle, the other
triangle, and the other one.

66
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:57,080
And we know each of those
will have 180 degrees

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,889
if we take the sum
of their angles.

68
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,430
And we also know that the sum
of all of those interior angles

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,050
are equal to the sum
of the interior angles

70
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,240
of the polygon as a whole.

71
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,540
And to see that, clearly,
this interior angle

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,850
is one of the angles
of the polygon.

73
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,290
This is as well.

74
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,587
But when you take the sum
of this one and this one,

75
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:16,670
then you're going to get
that whole interior angle

76
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,750
of the polygon.

77
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,875
And when you take the sum
of that one and that one,

78
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,250
you get that entire one.

79
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,270
And then when you take
the sum of that one

80
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,972
plus that one plus that one, you
get that entire interior angle.

81
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:29,430
So if you take the sum of all
of the interior angles of all

82
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,430
of these triangles, you're
actually just finding

83
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,810
the sum of all of the interior
angles of the polygon.

84
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,990
So in this case, you have
one, two, three triangles.

85
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,980
So three times 180
degrees is equal to what?

86
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,360
300 plus 240 is
equal to 540 degrees.

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,940
Now let's generalize it.

88
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,520
And to generalize
it, let's realize

89
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,280
that just to get our
first two triangles,

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
we have to use up four sides.

91
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,250
We have to use up all the four
sides in this quadrilateral.

92
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,161
We had to use up four
of the five sides--

93
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,410
right here-- in this pentagon.

94
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,480
One, two, and then three, four.

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,550
So four sides give
you two triangles.

96
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,970
And it seems like, maybe,
every incremental side

97
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,470
you have after that, you can
get another triangle out of it.

98
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,130
Let's experiment with a hexagon.

99
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,700
And I'm just going to try to
see how many triangles I get out

100
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,200
of it.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,283
So one, two, three,
four, five, six sides.

102
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:27,260

103
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,140
I get one triangle out
of these two sides.

104
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,980
One, two sides of
the actual hexagon.

105
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,050
I can get another
triangle out of these two

106
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,450
sides of the actual hexagon.

107
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,920
And it looks like I can
get another triangle out

108
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,520
of each of the remaining sides.

109
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,010
So one out of that one.

110
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,860
And then one out of that
one, right over there.

111
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,060
So in general, it
seems like-- let's say.

112
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,110
So let's say that
I have s sides.

113
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,565
s-sided polygon.

114
00:04:56,565 --> 00:05:00,786

115
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:02,160
And I'll just
assume-- we already

116
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,230
saw the case for four sides,
five sides, or six sides.

117
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,740
So we can assume that s
is greater than 4 sides.

118
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,240
Let's say I have
an s-sided polygon,

119
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
and I want to figure out how
many non-overlapping triangles

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,900
will perfectly
cover that polygon.

121
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,234
How many can I fit inside of it?

122
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,566
And then I just have to
multiply the number of triangles

123
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,500
times 180 degrees
to figure out what

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,690
are the sum of the interior
angles of that polygon.

125
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,600
So let's figure out
the number of triangles

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,170
as a function of
the number of sides.

127
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,320
So once again, four
of the sides are

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,060
going to be used to
make two triangles.

129
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,120
So those two sides
right over there.

130
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,172
And then we have two
sides right over there.

131
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,130
I can draw one triangle
over-- and I'm not even

132
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,294
going to talk about
what happens on the rest

133
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:46,460
of the sides of the polygon.

134
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,918
You could imagine putting a
big black piece of construction

135
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:49,470
paper.

136
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,959
There might be other sides here.

137
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not going to even
worry about them right now.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,610
So out of these two
sides I can draw

139
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,420
one triangle, just like that.

140
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,980
Out of these two sides, I can
draw another triangle right

141
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,640
over there.

142
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,550
So four sides used
for two triangles.

143
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,340

144
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,900
And then, no matter how many
sides I have left over-- so

145
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,280
I've already used four of
the sides, but after that,

146
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,900
if I have all sorts
of craziness here.

147
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,300
I could have all sorts
of craziness here.

148
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,420
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

149
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,950
So I could have all sorts of
craziness right over here.

150
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,820
It looks like every
other incremental side

151
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,380
I can get another
triangle out of it.

152
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,060
So that's one triangle out
of there, one triangle out

153
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,500
of that side, one
triangle out of that side,

154
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,220
one triangle out of that side,
and then one triangle out

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,210
of this side.

156
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,290
So for example, this
figure that I've drawn

157
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,000
is a very irregular-- one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,970
eight, nine, 10.

159
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,620
Is that right?

160
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,870
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

161
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,210
It is a decagon.

162
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,050
And in this decagon,
four of the sides

163
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,220
were used for two triangles.

164
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,910
So I got two triangles
out of four of the sides.

165
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,820
And out of the other
six sides I was

166
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,120
able to get a triangle each.

167
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,440
These are six.

168
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,175
This is one, two,
three, four, five.

169
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,633
Actually, let me make sure I'm
counting the number of sides

170
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,540
right.

171
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:21,909
So I have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

172
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,747
10.

173
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:23,580
So let me make sure.

174
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,691
Did I count-- am I just
not seeing something?

175
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:28,190
Oh, I see.

176
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,410
I actually didn't-- I have to
draw another line right over

177
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,770
here.

178
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,450
These are two different
sides, and so I

179
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,740
have to draw another
line right over here.

180
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,319
I can get another triangle
out of that right over there.

181
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
And so there you have it.

182
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,960
I have these two triangles
out of four sides.

183
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,800
And out of the other
six remaining sides

184
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,250
I get a triangle each.

185
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,110
So plus six triangles.

186
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,610
I got a total of
eight triangles.

187
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,700
And so we can generally
think about it.

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,510
The first four, sides we're
going to get two triangles.

189
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,170
So let me write this down.

190
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,630
So our number of triangles
is going to be equal to 2.

191
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,370
And then, I've already
used four sides.

192
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,070
So the remaining sides
I get a triangle each.

193
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,440
So the remaining sides
are going to be s minus 4.

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,730
So the number of triangles are
going to be 2 plus s minus 4.

195
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,280
2 plus s minus 4
is just s minus 2.

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,910
So if I have an
s-sided polygon, I

197
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,110
can get s minus 2 triangles that
perfectly cover that polygon

198
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,830
and that don't overlap with
each other, which tells us

199
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,549
that an s-sided polygon, if
it has s minus 2 triangles,

200
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,809
that the interior angles
in it are going to be

201
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,559
s minus 2 times 180 degrees.

202
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,309
Which is a pretty cool result.

203
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,540
So if someone told you that they
had a 102-sided polygon-- so

204
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,680
s is equal to 102 sides.

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,990
You can say, OK, the
number of interior angles

206
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,140
are going to be 102 minus 2.

207
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,730
So it's going to be 100
times 180 degrees, which

208
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,850
is equal to 180 with two
more zeroes behind it.

209
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,620
So it'd be 18,000 degrees
for the interior angles

210
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,930
of a 102-sided polygon.

1
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,390
For tens of thousands of years,

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,117
Homo sapiens lived throughout Africa,

3
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:24,040
but only some of these people were our ancestors.

4
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:36,032
By 60,000 years ago, our ancestors were on the move,

5
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:39,951
and their expansions started to have staying power,

6
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:47,392
we don't know how fast, or how far they traveled.

7
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:53,509
Today, hunter-gatherer groups move, on average, about 1 km a year,

8
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:55,460
it's about half mile.

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,425
But it's not always consistent--what we do know is this,

10
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:05,209
as their descendants moved into new environments,

11
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,225
they became more isolated from one another,

12
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:13,374
setting the stage for the high level of genetic diversity

13
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,806
that we see in Africa today.

14
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:24,559
By 50,000 years ago, people started making more sophisticated tools,

15
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:28,360
and creating a lot more art.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,401
Did new language abilities spark this burst of innovation?

17
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:41,339
Maybe a genetic change in a population allowed some people

18
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:44,958
to express more complex concepts through language,

19
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,326
and so to out-compete those who couldn't,

20
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:50,693
no one really knows.

21
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:59,615
Around 50,000 years ago, small groups of travelers crossed into Asia,

22
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:04,031
possibly as few as a hundred people in all.

23
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:14,738
Everyone alive today who has any non-African ancestors is probably descended from these travelers.

24
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:21,839
Within a few thousand years, climatic conditions became drier,

25
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:26,476
and the Sahara desert expanded, making it harder to turn back,

26
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:35,365
the intrepid travelers and their descendants followed a coastal route, eastward in Asia,

27
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:39,764
reaching present day Malaysia within a few millenium.

28
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:45,850
Did they meet Homo erectus along the way?

29
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:58,426
By 45,000 years ago, people were living in parts of Australia and making their mark.

30
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:08,094
In order to get there, they had to cross the 90 km--that's about 50 miles--of open water

31
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:13,384
which separates Australia from the nearest islands of present-day Indonesia.

32
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:19,134
Just how this was done, no one knows.

33
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,282
It's amazing to think that people reached Australia and Europe

34
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,432
at around the same time.

35
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:33,740
Traveling eastward and southward along the coast of Asia,

36
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,524
people didn't experience big and hard environmental changes;

37
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,688
but hitting northward, into Europe,

38
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:47,573
they faced extremely harsh, cold climates and tough terrain.

39
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,831
As humans moved into Europe, they also ran into the Neanderthals,

40
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:59,430
who'd been living there for hundreds of thousands of years.

41
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:07,609
The Neanderthals were stocky, and physically better adapted to the cold climates,

42
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,933
but the newcomers proved to be very skilled

43
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:15,588
at shaping natural materials into useful and attractive objects.

44
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:23,144
Though the Neanderthals may have acquired some of their neighbors' advanced technologies,

45
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,260
they soon found it hard to keep up.

46
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:32,991
Humans' success might have meant the Neanderthals' downfall.

47
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:40,976
The two populations coexisted, even interbred, for a few millenium,

48
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:47,028
but by 35,000 years ago, Neanderthals were confined

49
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:53,380
to the southwest corner of Europe, and soon thereafter, they had disappeared,

50
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:01,960
another unsolved mystery, yes, our story is full of them.

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,251
Homo sapiens outlasted their cousins, and expanded their reach

52
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:12,699
across Africa, Eurasia, and Australia;

53
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,762
but soon times got tough for everyone,

54
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:27,667
how would our ancestors cope with the extreme temperatures of the ice age.

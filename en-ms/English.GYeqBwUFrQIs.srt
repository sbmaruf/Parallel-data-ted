00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm going to briefly talk of AI as something else,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is AI is the technique of uncertainty management in computer software.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Put differently, AI is the discipline that you apply when you want to know what to do

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
when you don't know what to do.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, there's many reasons why there might be uncertainty in a computer program.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There could be a sensor limit.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That is, your sensors are unable to tell me

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
what exactly is the case outside the AI system.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There could be adversaries who act in a way that makes it hard for you

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to understand what is the case.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There could be stochastic environments.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Every time you roll the dice in a dice game,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the stochasticity of the dice will make it impossible for you

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to be absolutely certain of what's the situation.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There could be laziness.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So perhaps you can actually compute what the situation is,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but your computer program is just too lazy to do it.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And here's my favorite: ignorance, plain ignorance.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Many people are just ignorant of what's going on.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They could know it, but they just don't care.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All of these things are cause for uncertainty.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
AI is the discipline that deals with uncertainty and manages it in decision making.

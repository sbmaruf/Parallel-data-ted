1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's now see if we can divide into larger numbers.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,860
And just as a starting point, in order to divide into larger numbers,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,920
you at least need to know your multiplication tables

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,550
from the one-multiplication tables all the way to, at least, the ten-multiplication.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,080
So all the way up to ten times ten, which you know is one hundred.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,055
And then, starting at one times one and going up to two times three,

7
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,320
all the way up to ten times ten.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,842
And, at least when I was in school,

9
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,340
we learned through twelve times twelve.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,100
But ten times ten will probably do the trick.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,770
And that's really just the starting point.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,550
Because to do multiplication problems like this,

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,150
for example, or division problems like this.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,640
Let's say I'm taking twenty-five and I want to divide it by five.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,118
So I could draw twenty-five objects,

16
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:44,558
and then divide them into groups of five or divide them into five groups,

17
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,590
and see how many elements are in each group.

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,562
But the quick way to do is just to think about,

19
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:52,930
well, five times what is twenty-five, right?

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,100
Five times question mark is equal to twenty-five.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,860
And if you know your multiplication tables,

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,070
especially your five-multiplication tables,

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,280
you know that five times five is equal to twenty-five.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,834
So something like this, you'll immediately just be able to say,

25
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,692
because of your knowledge of multiplication,

26
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:14,840
that five goes into twenty-five five times.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,243
And you'd write the five right there.

28
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,180
Not over the two,

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,040
because you still want to be careful of the place notation.

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,650
You want to write the five in the ones place.

31
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,480
It goes into it five ones times, or exactly five times.

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,190
And the same thing.

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,770
If I said seven goes into forty-nine.

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,250
That's how many times?

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,772
Well you say, that's like saying seven times what--

36
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:39,373
you could even, instead of a question mark, you could put a blank there--

37
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:43,130
seven times what is equal to forty-nine?

38
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,452
And if you know your multiplication tables,

39
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:50,090
you know that seven times seven is equal to forty-nine.

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,145
All the examples I've done so far is a number multiplied by itself.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,030
Let me do another example.

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,840
Let me do nine goes into fifty-four how many times?

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,102
Once again, you need to know your multiplication tables to do this.

44
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:09,290
Nine times what is equal to fifty-four?

45
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,904
And sometimes, even if you don't have it memorized,

46
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:14,720
you could say nine times five is forty-five.

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,470
And nine times six would be nine more than that, so that would be fifty-four.

48
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,380
So nine goes into fifty-four six times.

49
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,590
So just as a starting point,

50
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,253
you need to have your multiplication tables from one times one

51
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,250
all the way up the ten times ten memorized.

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,689
In order to be able to do at least some of these more basic problems relatively quickly.

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,968
Now, with that out of the way, let's try to do some problems

54
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:44,015
that might not fit completely cleanly into your multiplication tables.

55
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:46,190
So let's say I want to divide--

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:54,800
I am looking to divide three into forty-three.

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,440
And, once again, this is larger than three times ten or three times twelve.

58
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,930
Actually, look.

59
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,950
Well, let me do another problem.

60
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,260
Let me do three into twenty-three.

61
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,165
And, if you know your three-times tables,

62
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:10,060
you realize that there's three times nothing is exactly twenty-three.

63
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,910
I'll do it right now.

64
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,280
Three times one is three.

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,690
Three times two is six.

66
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,870
Let me just write them all out.

67
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,690
Three times three is nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-four, right?

68
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,700
There's no twenty-three in the multiples of three.

69
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
So how do you do this division problem?

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,434
Well what you do is you think of what is the largest multiple of three that does go into twenty-three?

71
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,640
And that's twenty-one.

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,170
And three goes into twenty-one how many times?

73
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,150
Well you know that three times seven is equal to twenty-one.

74
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,520
So you say, well three will go into twenty-three seven times.

75
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,570
But it doesn't go into it cleanly,

76
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,850
because seven times three is twenty-one.

77
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,750
So there's a remainder left over.

78
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,170
So if you take twenty-three minus twenty-one, you have a remainder of two.

79
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:08,010
So you could write that twenty-three divided by three is equal to seven,

80
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,995
remainder-- maybe I'll just, well, write the whole word out --remainder two.

81
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,050
So it doesn't have to go in completely cleanly.

82
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,790
And, in the future, we'll learn about decimals and fractions.

83
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,747
But for now, you just say, well it goes in cleanly seven times,

84
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:24,290
but that only gets us to twenty-one.

85
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,110
But then there's two left over.

86
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,507
So you can even work with the division problems

87
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:31,078
where it's not exactly a multiple of the number

88
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:33,310
that you're dividing into the larger number.

89
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,720
But let's do some practice with even larger numbers.

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,520
And I think you'll see a pattern here.

91
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:47,058
So let's do four going into--

92
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm going to pick a pretty large number here --three hundred forty-four.

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,694
And, immediately when you see that,

94
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,850
you might say, hey Sal, I know up to four times ten or four times twelve.

95
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,850
Four times twelve is forty-eight.

96
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,340
This is a much larger number.

97
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,767
This is way out of bounds

98
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,420
of what I know in my four-multiplication tables.

99
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,379
And what I'm going to show you right now is a way of doing this,

100
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,910
just knowing your four-multiplication tables.

101
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,889
So what you do is you say

102
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,800
four goes into this three how many times?

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,479
And you're actually saying

104
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,430
four goes into this three how many hundred times?

105
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,590
So this is-- because this is three hundred, right?

106
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,880
This is three hundred forty-four.

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,934
But four goes into three no hundred times, or four goes into--

108
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:32,810
I guess the best way to think of it --four goes three zero times.

109
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,470
So you can just move on.

110
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,260
Four goes into thirty-four.

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,460
So now we're going to focus on the thirty-four.

112
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,900
So four goes into thirty-four how many times?

113
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,900
And here we can use our four-multiplication tables.

114
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,950
Four-- Let's see, four times eight is equal to thirty-two.

115
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,210
Four times nine is equal to thirty-six.

116
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,630
So four goes into thirty-four-- nine is too many times, right?

117
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,500
Thirty-six is larger than thirty-four.

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,746
So four goes into thirty-four eight times.

119
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,089
There's going to be a little bit left over.

120
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,032
Four goes into thirty-four eight times.

121
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:10,856
So let's figure out what's left over.

122
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:11,565
And really we're saying,

123
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:14,947
four goes into three hundred forty how many ten times?

124
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:17,807
So we're actually saying four goes into three hundred forty eighty times.

125
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:20,020
Because notice we wrote this eight in the tens place.

126
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,882
But just for our ability to do this problem quickly,

127
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,954
you just say four goes into thirty-four eight times,

128
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:28,770
but make sure you write the eight in the tens place right there.

129
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,100
Eight times four.

130
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,970
We already know what that is.

131
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,140
Eight times four is thirty-two.

132
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,290
And then we figure out the remainder.

133
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,160
Thirty-four minus thirty-two.

134
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
Well, four minus two is two.

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,030
And then these threes cancel out.

136
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,300
So you're just left with a two.

137
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,120
But notice we're in the tens column, right?

138
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,710
This whole column right here, that's the tens column.

139
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:55,120
So really what we said is four goes into three hundred forty eighty times.

140
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,350
Eighty times four is three hundred twenty, right?

141
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,844
Because I wrote the three in the hundreds column.

142
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:05,701
And then, there is--

143
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,215
let me clean this up a little bit.

144
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:08,872
I didn't want to make that line there look like a--

145
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,510
when I was dividing the columns-- to look like a one.

146
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,934
But then there's a remainder of two,

147
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:14,270
but I wrote the two in the tens place.

148
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,740
So it's actually a remainder of twenty.

149
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,990
But let me bring down this four.

150
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,660
Because I didn't want to just divide into three hundred forty.

151
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,290
I divided into three hundred forty-four.

152
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,290
So you bring down the four.

153
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,440
Let me switch colors.

154
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,670
And then-- So another way to think about it.

155
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,250
We just said that four goes into three hundred forty-four eighty times, right?

156
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,050
We wrote the eight in the tens place.

157
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,550
And then eight times four is three hundred twenty.

158
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,170
The remainder is now twenty-four.

159
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,800
So how many times does four go into twenty-four?

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,631
Well we know that.

161
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:46,158
Four times six is equal to twenty-four.

162
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,107
So four goes into twenty-four six times.

163
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,685
And we put that in the ones place.

164
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,480
Six times four is twenty-four.

165
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
And then we subtract.

166
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,270
Twenty-four minus twenty-four.

167
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,490
That's-- We subtract at that stage, either case.

168
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,530
And we get zero.

169
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,050
So there's no remainder.

170
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,850
So four goes into three hundred forty-four exactly eighty-six times.

171
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,180
So if your took three hundred forty-four objects and divided them into groups of four,

172
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,900
you would get eighty-six groups.

173
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,950
Or if you divided them into groups of eighty-six,

174
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,880
you would get four groups.

175
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,640
Let's do a couple more problems.

176
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,440
I think you're getting the hang of it.

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,180
Let me do seven-- I'll do a simple one.

178
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,790
Seven goes into ninety-one.

179
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,387
So once again, well, this is beyond seven times twelve,

180
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:31,340
which is eighty-four, which you know from our multiplication tables.

181
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,650
So we use the same system we did in the last problem.

182
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,750
Seven goes into nine how many times?

183
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,220
Seven goes into nine one time.

184
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,640
One times seven is seven.

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,330
And you have nine minus seven is two.

186
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,190
And then you bring down the one.

187
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,770
Twenty-one.

188
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,036
And remember, this might seem like magic,

189
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:57,545
but what we really said was seven goes into ninety ten
times--

190
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,961
ten because we wrote the one in the tens place--

191
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,466
ten times seven is seventy.

192
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:05,053
Right?-- You could almost put a zero there if you like--

193
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:08,380
And ninety-one minus seventy is twenty-one.

194
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,640
So seven goes into ninety-one ten times remainder twenty-one.

195
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,780
And then you say seven goes into twenty-one-- Well you know that.

196
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,590
Seven times three is twenty-one.

197
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,170
So seven goes into twenty-one three times.

198
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,710
Three times seven is twenty-one.

199
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,550
You subtract these from each other.

200
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,375
Remainder zero.

201
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:31,908
So ninety-one divided by seven is equal to thirteen.

202
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:32,530
Let's do another one.

203
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,863
And I won't take that little break to explain the places and all of that.

204
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:36,800
I think you understand that.

205
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,569
I want, at least, you to get the process down really really well in this video.

206
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,990
So let's do seven-- I keep using the number seven.

207
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,510
Let me do a different number.

208
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:56,560
Let me do eight goes into six hundred eight how many times?

209
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
So I go eight goes into six how many times?

210
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,740
It goes into it zero times.

211
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,980
So let me keep moving.

212
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,360
Eight goes into sixty how many times?

213
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,820
Let me write down the eight.

214
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,110
Let me draw a line here so we don't get confused.

215
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,340
Let me scroll down a little bit.

216
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,760
I need some space above the number.

217
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,580
So eight goes into sixty how many times?

218
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,590
We know that eight times seven is equal to fifty-six.

219
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,330
And that eight times eight is equal to sixty-four.

220
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,640
So eight goes into-- sixty-four is too big.

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,770
So it's not this one.

222
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:29,876
So eight goes into sixty, seven times.

223
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,740
There's going to be a little bit left over.

224
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,600
So eight goes into sixty, seven times.

225
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,728
Since we're doing the whole sixty,

226
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:38,799
we put the seven above the ones place in the sixty,

227
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,062
which is the tens place in the whole thing.

228
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:44,970
Seven times eight, we know, is fifty-six.

229
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,100
Sixty minus fifty-six.

230
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,030
That's four.

231
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,990
We could do that in our heads.

232
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,270
Or if we wanted, we can borrow.

233
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,510
That be a ten.

234
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,380
That would be a five.

235
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,890
Ten minus six is four.

236
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,930
Then you bring down this eight.

237
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,738
Eight goes into forty-eight how many times?

238
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,260
Well what's eight times six?

239
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,210
Well, eight times six is exactly forty-eight.

240
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,170
So eight times-- eight goes into forty-eight six times.

241
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,180
Six times eight is forty-eight.

242
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,180
And you subtract.

243
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,500
We subtracted up here as well.

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,020
Forty-eight minus forty-eight is zero.

245
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,260
So, once again, we get a remainder of zero.

246
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,798
So hopefully, that gives you the hang of how to do these larger division problems.

247
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:31,012
And all we really need to know to be able to do these,

248
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:34,242
to tackle these, is our multiplication tables

249
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:38,381
up to maybe ten times ten or twelve times twelve.

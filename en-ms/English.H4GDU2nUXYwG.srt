Hello! I am very glad to see you!

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,980
Today I am going to draw a water drop.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,300
And do not leave because at the end of the
tutorial I am going to show you 2 paintings

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:17,300
to give examples of how you can use a water
drop in a work of art.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,660
To start I sketch the shape of the drop and
go over it.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,670
In a transparent object, the light behaves
in a particular way:

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,930
Lets say that the beams of light come from
the top-left,

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,570
then the darkest part would be precisely on
this part, as the light would go through the

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,470
drop and illuminate the bottom-right.

10
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,469
And here, if anything, will be a little reflexion.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,870
Down here then, would be the most light.

12
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:05,870
I start shading the darkest part of the drop.
IÂ«m using a slightly hard lead: an H

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,850
It would cast a shadow on this side, but in
the middle of it, would be a light.

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,420
Then with a brush I smudge the graphite for
a more even finish.

15
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,269
I reinforce the shadow in the vicinity of
the drop,

16
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,280
and then smudge it.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,280
With a kneaded eraser I pull some reflexions.

18
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,599
And then with a white pencil, pastel like,
I reinforce the lights.

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,600
It is dry. A sort of chalk.

20
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,909
I darken a little further.

21
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,770
This is not a drawing paper and is leaving
me black spots. Even after smudging you can

22
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,700
still see them.

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,700
Therefore I sharpen my eraser like an ant
eater [chuckles], and I pull the dots.

24
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,010
Then, if I left some white spots, I fill them
in carefully with the lead.

25
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,950
It should be smooth and uniform, to look like
a water drop.

26
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,250
I want to give it even more light!

27
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,030
The beauty of drawing on a toned paper,

28
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,160
is that the lights really stand out.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Specially if they go with good shadows.

30
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,610
I will extend it further up,

31
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,610
although this part is going to be flatter
and without reflexions.

32
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,270
I hope you liked it. That is finished!

33
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,929
And as promised, I will show you 2 paintings:

34
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,260
This is an oil on canvas called Freshness.
It is a pretty simple one.

35
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:48,260
While this... does not have a water drop...
it has about 320 drops!

36
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,609
I would really like to know what do you think
about it. You can write me in the comments

37
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,190
section of the video.
And if you liked the tutorial, please give

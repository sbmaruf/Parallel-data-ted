1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570


2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,620
Compute twenty-five hundred
times 80, or 2,500 times 80.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,160
Now, we could just do this
multiplication problem like a

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,725
traditional one, but when you
have these numbers with a lot

5
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:15,340
of zeroes there, and it actually
sometimes helps you

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,010
do it in your head, is
to kind of think

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,260
about the zeroes later.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,120
And the reason why we can do
that-- let's rewrite this

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,580
multiplication problem.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,920
2,500 times 80.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,020
This is equivalent to--
2,500 is what?

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,760
It's 25 times 100.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,680
This is equivalent
to 25 times 100.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,680
That's what 2,500 is.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,320
2,500 is 25 times
100 times 80.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,760
And what's 80?

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,260
80 is 8 times 10.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,990
And in multiplication, you can
rearrange it any way you like.

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,250
You can change the order when
it's all a bunch of numbers

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,290
being multiplied.

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,440
So this is the same thing, this
is the equivalent to 25

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:10,610
times 8 times 100 times 10.

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,130
And in the future, you're going
to be able to do this in

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,950
your head, but I really want
to show you why you can do

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,010
this in your head, why you can
just multiply 25 times 8, and

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,920
then worry about the zeroes.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,570
So what's this going
to be equal to?

28
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:28,210
So this is going to be
equal to 25 times 8.

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,860
And what's 100 times 10?

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,890
Well, 100 times 10 is 1,000.

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,680
You can maybe do that
in your head.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,200


33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,950
And whenever you multiply powers
of ten, the way you can

34
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,720
think about it is you just
literally add the zeroes.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,290
You had two zeroes here.

36
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,490
You have one zero here.

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,040
When you take their product,
you're going to get something

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,970
with three zeroes.

39
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,180
100 times 10 is 1,000.

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,870
And when we multiply this times
whatever this is, we'll

41
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,430
literally just add three zeroes
to the product, so

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,960
that's why this is useful.

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,490
We can now think about this as
being-- this is the same thing

44
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:06,540
as 25 times 8, and then whatever
25 times 8 is, we can

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,460
then add three zeroes to it.

46
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,780
Hopefully, this explained
a little bit about why.

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,050
Let's figure out what
25 times 8 is.

48
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,870
25 times 8.

49
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,210
5 times 8 is 40.

50
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,150
Put the zero down.

51
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,400
Carry the 4.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,150
8 times 2 is 16 plus 4 is 20.

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,380
So it's an even 200,
which makes sense.

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,630
4 times 24 is 100, or four
quarters make a $1.00, so

55
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,080
eight quarters would
make $2.00, so

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,150
that all makes sense.

57
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,440
So this part right here is
200, so we're going to

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,650
multiply 200 times 1,000.

59
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,980
The easiest way to think about
it is you just add the zeroes

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,300
when you're multiplying
times a power of ten.

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,580
So this is going to be-- we're
going to have a 200, or you

62
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,510
could just imagine you have 2,
0, 0, and then you add the

63
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,280
three zeroes there.

64
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,550
One, two, three, and you
are left with 200,000.

65
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,450
So 2,500 times 80: 200,000.

66
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,400
You could've multiplied it out
in the traditional sense, but

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,430
it's good to see this-- I guess
you could call it a

68
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,490
trick or a way to do it in
your head a little bit.

69
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,930
And you'll see that more
and more, the more

70
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,710
practice you get.

71
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:23,799

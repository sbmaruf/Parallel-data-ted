1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560


2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,230
We're asked to simplify 12 plus,
and then in parentheses,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,100
5 minus 1 times 3 to the second
power, or 3 squared,

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,170
minus 8 divided by the square
root, or really the principal

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,860
root, of 4.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,270
Now, whenever you see something
like this, you

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,080
really just want to put
your brain into order

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,610
of operations mode.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,720
And just to remind ourselves,
the top priority goes to

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
parentheses, so I'll just draw
some parentheses there.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,940
Then after that, we
do exponents.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,970
And in exponents, we also
consider square

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,049
roots to be an exponent.

14
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,770
So after parentheses, we then
worry about things that look

15
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,850
like a to the b power or things
that look like they

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,410
have a radical on them.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,580
You'll learn in the future that
the square root is really

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,960
raising something to
the 1/2 power.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
That's why it's the same
thing as an exponent.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,350
And then we do multiplication
and division.

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,600


22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,480
And then finally, you do
addition and subtraction.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,170


24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,040
So let's apply that
to this over here.

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,230
So we have one set of
parentheses right there.

26
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,150
You have that parentheses, and
inside you have 5 minus 1, so

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,920
we want evaluate that
first of all.

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,280
So 5 minus 1 is 4.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,370
So our problem becomes 12--
plus the 5 minus 1 is 4--

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:30,690
times 3 squared minus 8 divided
by the positive square

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,050
root of 4, the principal
root of 4.

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,820
Now, we got all our parentheses
out of the way.

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,070
Do we see any exponents here?

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,950
We're at this stage now.

35
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,140
Well, I have this 3 to the
second power, 3 squared, and I

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,920
also have the square
root of 4, so let's

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
evaluate those next.

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,260
3 to the second power is 9.

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,240
That's the same thing
as 3 times 3.

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,060
So let me write that down
just as a review.

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,710
3 to the second power is
equal to 3 times 3,

42
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,940
which is equal to 9.

43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,770
It is NOT equal to 3 times 2.

44
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,180
It's 3 times 3.

45
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,800
So 3 squared is 9, so we'll
put that 9 there.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
And the square root of 4, so the
square root of 4, I'll do

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,660
it down here.

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,490
The square root of 4, what times
itself or what positive

49
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,710
number, or non-negative number,
I should say, times

50
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,600
itself is equal to 4?

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,310
Well, it's 2, right?

52
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,520
This is the same thing as the
square root of 2 times 2,

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,190
which is equal to 2.

54
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,230
So the principal root of 4 is 2,
and then we have everything

55
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,190
else there.

56
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:47,510
We have the 12 plus this 4 times
this 9 minus 8 divided

57
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,950
by that 2 right there.

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,490
Now, what's next?

59
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,780
Well, we're done with the
parentheses and exponents.

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,600
Now we go to the multiplication
and division.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,090
Is that going on anywhere?

62
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,630
Well, sure.

63
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,020
We have this multiplication
right over there, and then we

64
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,320
have this division right
over there, so lets

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,170
evaluate those next.

66
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:14,390
So 4 times 9 is 36 and 8 divided
by 2 is 4, so we are

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:22,240
left with 12 plus 36 minus 8
divided by 2, which is 4.

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,790
And now we're finally at this
stage of our order of

69
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,490
operation, so we can just
evaluate left to right.

70
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,360
What is 12 plus 36?

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,380
12 plus 36-- I'll do this
right here-- is 48.

72
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,540
So we have 48 minus 4.

73
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,610
When you evaluate that,
48 minus 4 is just 44.

74
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,380
And we're all done!

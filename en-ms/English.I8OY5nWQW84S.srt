1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,570
I just received this drug calculation problem from a

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,250
nursing student, and I think it's essential that the nursing

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,890
students out there are able to do this, just in case I'm the

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,350
patient receiving the drug.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:10,880
So let's do it.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,440
And I think it's an interesting unit conversion problem for

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,010
pretty much anyone who wants practice with unit conversion.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,560
So the question is that we have a doctor.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,740
The doctor orders drug x.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,780
And this is the dosage that the doctor's requesting.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:39,530
They're saying five milligrams per pound of patient weight-- I'll

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,780
just write per pound of patient weight-- every twelve hours.

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,700
This is what we're supposed to do.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:58,130
But our supply of the drug-- it isn't just, you know, not

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,430
just nuggets and milligrams.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,340
It's a solution.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,200
There's a certain amount of grams for every milliliter

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,330
that we have of the solution.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,180
It's dissolved in some water.

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,020
So this is our supply of drug x.

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,060
We have 0.9-- I'll write a 0 in front.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,590
My wife, who is a doctor, says it's essential to write the

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,980
zero in front of the decimal.

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:29,910
We have 0.9 grams per milliliter of solution.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,820
So if I were to take one milliliter out of my solution

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,410
and give it to someone, I'm essentially giving them

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,900
0.9 grams of this drug.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,950
And the final piece of information we're given is that

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,300
the patient-- they weigh-- and maybe we should say they mass,

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,720
because kilograms is mass, but we get the idea.

31
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,790
The patient is 72.7 kilograms.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,090
So there's a couple interesting things here.

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,040
We have to figure out the dosage in terms of milliliters.

34
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,750
We have to-- oh, actually, I didn't even tell

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,580
you the question.

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,060
The question is, how many milliliters of solution

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,490
do we have to give to the patient per dose?

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:23,410
So milliliters of solution per dose.

39
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,740
That's our question.

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,430
And there's a couple of things.

41
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,000
We have to go from milligrams to grams.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,280
And then convert that to milliliters.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,520
And then they tell us per pound, but then they gave us

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,470
the patient's weight, or their mass, in kilograms.

45
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,820
So we have to do some conversion there.

46
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,240
So I definitely can appreciate how this can be a little

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,900
daunting and maybe confusing at times.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,090
So let's just do it step by step.

49
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,430
So the first interesting thing-- and this is just

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
something that you might need to know, or you might have

51
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,240
written down on paper, or you might have a calculator that

52
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,610
does this-- is just how to convert kilograms to pounds.

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,750
And it's good to know in general, if you're converting

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,560
between the metric and the English systems.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,510
So 1 kilogram is approximately equal to 2.2 pounds.

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Not exactly, but that's a pretty good approximation.

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,860
And one pound-- if you just take one over that-- one pound is

58
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,550
approximately equal to 0.45 kilograms.

59
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,950
So we'll just put this in a box.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,240
This is the only kind of outside conversion information

61
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,630
we'll need to do this problem.

62
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,890
Everything else, we'll just need a calculator, unless we

63
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,560
just want to spend a lot of time doing some arithmetic.

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,200
So the first thing.

65
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,490
Let's figure out our dosage in terms of per kilogram.

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,960
This is per pound, and we really don't need to

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,200
know every twelve hours.

68
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,330
Because they're saying, how many milliliters of solution

69
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,950
do we do per dose?

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,240
A dose is every twelve hours.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,690
So we just really, you know-- the every twelve hours is kind

72
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,730
of extra information.

73
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,720
So we want to figure out this five milligrams per pound.

74
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,090
How do we convert that to how many milligrams per kilogram?

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,170
So let's do five-- I'll write it down here in magenta--

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,180
five milligrams per pound.

77
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,900
And then we want to convert this to per kilogram.

78
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,590
So we can multiply this times the number of pounds per

79
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,820
kilogram-- I'll do it in yellow-- times this

80
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,540
information up here.

81
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:25,300
Times 2.2 pounds per kilogram.

82
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,750
And if you ever get confused-- you know, gee, how did Sal know

83
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,780
to multiply by 2.2 instead of dividing by 2.2?

84
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,350
Which is the same thing as multiplying by 0.5.

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,290
You can pay very close attention to the units.

86
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,230
Notice, I wrote 2.2 pounds per kilogram.

87
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,910
2.2 pounds per 1 kilogram.

88
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,810
And you know this'll work out, because you have a pound in

89
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,180
the numerator and you have a pound in the denominator.

90
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,420
It's called dimensional analysis.

91
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,490
If you ever get confused with these things-- and I think,

92
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,560
once you do enough practice, you'll find that you won't

93
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,890
have to pay too much attention to this.

94
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,240
But at first, when you're getting started, just to make

95
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,360
sure you're not multiplying or dividing by the wrong

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,250
thing, just make sure the dimensions cancel out.

97
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,310
Pounds in the numerator, pounds in the denominator.

98
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,350
So let's do that.

99
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,110
Pounds in the numerator, pounds in the denominator cancel out.

100
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,540
And you multiply 5 times 2.2.

101
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,280
This is equal to-- let's see.

102
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,850
five times two is ten.

103
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,840
5 times 0.2 is 1.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,130
So this is equal to eleven.

105
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,320
And then in our numerator, we have milligrams.

106
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,290
eleven milligrams per kilogram.

107
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,160
So we just converted our dosage information to

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,880
a pure metric system.

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,750
It was actually a mix between the metric and the

110
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,170
English system before.

111
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,190
Now let's see what we can do.

112
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,120
Well, let's see if we can get it in terms of how many

113
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,440
milliliters we have to deliver per pound.

114
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,650
So once again, we want this-- well, actually, let's

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,990
go to grams first.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,180
Because we have milligrams here.

117
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,300
We have grams up here.

118
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,570
So let's see if we can convert this thing to grams.

119
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,760
So just like we did before, we want a milligrams

120
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,730
in the denominator.

121
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,020
I'll do it in orange.

122
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,470
We want a milligrams in the denominator and we want

123
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,230
a gram in the numerator.

124
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,110
Why did I say that?

125
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,180
Because I want this and this to cancel.

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,050
And I want a grams in the numerator.

127
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,270
So how many grams are there per milligram?

128
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,170
You can just think it through.

129
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,500
There's one gram per one thousand milligrams.

130
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,150
Or one thousand milligrams per gram.

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,320
And you just multiply it out.

132
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,150
So the milligrams cancels with the milligrams, and then

133
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,330
we get-- this is equal to eleven / one thousand grams per kilogram.

134
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,790
So now we have everything in terms of grams, but we want

135
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,050
it in terms of milliliters.

136
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,190
The question is, how many milliliters of

137
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,760
solution per dose?

138
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,870
So let me go down here on this line right here.

139
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,370
So we had this result.

140
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,630
We have eleven / one thousand-- I won't do the division just yet-- grams

141
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,920
of drug x per kilogram.

142
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,240
This is really just a re-- we've just rewritten

143
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,100
this dosage information in different units.

144
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,820
And let's see how much solution we need per kilogram.

145
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,880
So I want to cancel out the grams here and have

146
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,910
a milliliters there.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,790
So to cancel out that grams, I'm going to have to have a

148
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,970
gram in the denominator and a milliliter in the numerator.

149
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:34,440
So in our solution, how many grams are there per milliliter?

150
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,060
Well, they told us.

151
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,260
There are 0.9 grams per milliliter.

152
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,560
Or for every 1 milliliter, there are 0.9 grams.

153
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,930
Notice, I just took the inverse of that.

154
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,500
Because we want a milliliter in the numerator, grams in

155
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,780
the denominator, so that these two cancel out.

156
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,800
And let's do this multiplication now.

157
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,370
So our grams cancel out.

158
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,810
We have milliliters per kilogram.

159
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,900
And then we multiply it out.

160
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,780
11/1,000 times 1 over 0.9.

161
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,100
So I'll just keep-- let me just write it like this.

162
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:17,390
So there's going to be 11/1,000 times 0.9 milliliters of

163
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,840
our solution per kilogram.

164
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,410
So we've gotten this far.

165
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,240
So this is per kilogram of patient body weight.

166
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,070
And then finally, they tell us how many kilograms

167
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,010
our patient weighs.

168
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,190
So let's do that last multiplication, and then we can

169
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,220
actually get our calculator out and do it all at once.

170
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,130
So let's multiply this times-- we want to know how many

171
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,310
milliliters per patient.

172
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,280
We want the kilograms to cancel out.

173
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,320
So we want kilograms per patient.

174
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,140
Now we're talking about this particular patient.

175
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,240
Not every patient is going to be the same

176
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,390
number of kilograms.

177
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,710
But if we do this, kilograms will cancel out.

178
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,620
We'll have milliliters per patient-- milliliters of

179
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,360
solution per patient-- which is exactly what we want.

180
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,850
We want milliliters of solution per dose per patient.

181
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,960
But everything we've assumed so far has been per dose.

182
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,640
So how many kilograms does the patient weigh?

183
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,080
Well, there's 72.7 kilograms per patient.

184
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,660
That's how much the patient weighs.

185
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,700
So we just do this final multiplication and

186
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,290
we'll be done.

187
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,960
So our answer-- and as these two things are going to cancel

188
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,720
out-- so our final answer is going to be 11 times 72.7

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,720
divided by 100 times-- actually, 100 times 0.9 is

190
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,790
pretty easy to figure out.

191
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,070
That's nine hundred.

192
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,150
Divided by nine hundred milliliters per patient.

193
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,580
Or you can just say milliliters per dose.

194
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,500
However you want to say it.

195
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,460
Per dose per patient.

196
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,720
Let's get our calculator out and do this.

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:54,910
So we have 11 times 72.7 is equal to 799 divided by 900.

198
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,070
Is equal to 0.88-- well, we could round up.

199
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
0.889.

200
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,690
Hopefully the doctor won't mind.

201
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,440
So that is equal to-- I'll write it in a nice, vibrant

202
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:14,830
color-- 0.889 milliliters of solution per dose.

203
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,130
So this is what we're going to give every twelve hours.

204
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,520
If they ask, how many total milliliters over the

205
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,010
course of two days?

206
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,530
We would have to say, oh, there's forty-eight hours.

207
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,910
We'd multiply it by four.

208
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,250
But that twelve hours was extra information in this problem.

209
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,750
But anyway, hopefully this is useful, and it'll ensure that

210
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,710
any nurses serving me in the future are giving me

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,030
my proper dosage.

212
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,480
And hopefully, the doctor even got the right dosage to begin

213
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,050
with, because otherwise it's all for naught.

214
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,350
Anyway.

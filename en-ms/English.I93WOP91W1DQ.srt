1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,580
Compute 23 times 44.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,550
And maybe the hardest part of
this problem, or maybe the

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,470
first hard part, is to recognize
that that dot even

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,750
means multiplication.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,700
This could have also been
written as 23 times 44, or

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,880
they could have written it as 23
in parentheses times 44, so

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,130
you just put the
two parentheses

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,600
next to each other.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,840
That also implies
multiplication.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,860
So now that we know we're
multiplying, let's actually do

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,570
the problem.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,290
So we're going to multiply 23--
I'll write it bigger.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,060
We're going to multiply
23 by 44.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,370
I'll write the traditional
multiplication sign there,

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,740
just so that we know
we're multiplying.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,900
When you write it vertically
like this, you very seldom put

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,695
a dot there.

18
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:48,110
So let's do some
multiplication.

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,610
Let's start off multiplying
this 4 in the

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,310
ones place times 23.

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,790
So you have 3 times 4 is 12.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,530
We can write 2 in the ones
place, but then we want to

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,770
carry the 1, or we want
to regroup that

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,379
1 in the tens place.

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,310
So it's 12, so you put
the 1 over here.

26
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:14,420
And now you have 4 times
2 is 8 plus 1 is 9.

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,610
So you can think about
it as 4, this 4 right

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,980
here, times 23 is 92.

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,010
That's what we just
solved for.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,540
Now, we want to figure out
what this 4 times 23 is.

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,420
Now what we do here is, when you
just do it mechanically,

32
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,800
when you just learn the process,
you stick a 0 here.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,190
But the whole reason why you're
putting a 0 here is

34
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,230
because you're now dealing with
a 4 in the tens place.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,750
If you had another-- I don't
know, a 3 or a 4 or whatever

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,170
digit, and you're dealing with
the hundreds place, you'd put

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,600
more zeroes here, because we're
going to find out 4

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,900
times 23 is 92.

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,970
We just figured that out.

40
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,860
If we just multiplied this
4 times 23 again, we

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,320
would get 92 again.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
But this 4 is actually a 40, so
it actually should be 920,

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
and that's why we're
putting that 0.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,410
Now you're going to see
it in a second.

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,930
So we have-- so let me put this
in a different color.

46
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,410
So this 4 now we're
multiplying.

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,740
4 times 3 is 12.

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,150
Let's put the 2 right here.

49
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,480
It should be in the tens place
because this is really a 40

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,140
times the 3.

51
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,360
Just think about it,
or you could just

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,180
think of the process.

53
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,890
It's the next space
that's free.

54
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,440
4 times 3 is 12.

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,650
Carry the 1.

56
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,370
This blue 1 is from last time.

57
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,400
You ignore it now.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,450
You don't want to make
that mess it up.

59
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,190
That's when we multiplied
this 4.

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,990
So now we have 4 times
2 is 8 plus 1 is 9.

61
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,400
So what we figured out so far is
4 times 23 is 92, and this

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,590
green 4 times 23 is 920, and
that's because this green 4

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,920
actually represents 40.

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,640
It's in the tens place.

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,560
So when you multiply 44 times
23, it's going to be 4 times

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,940
23, which is 92, plus 40
times 23, which is 920.

67
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,300
I just want to make
sure we understand

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,530
what we're doing here.

69
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,770
And so we can take
their sum now.

70
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,060
Let's add them up.

71
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,120
2 plus 0 is 2.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,940
9 plus 2 is 11.

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,090
Carry the 1.

74
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,350
1 plus 9 is 10.

75
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,910
Put a comma here, just
so it's easy to

76
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,460
read, every third digit.

77
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,820
So 23 times 44 is 1,012.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Another search problem--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Consider the following search tree,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where this is the start node.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, assume we search from left to right.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I would like you to tell me the number of nodes expanded from Breadth-First Search

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and Depth-First Search.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Please do count the start and the goal node,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and please give me the same numbers for Right-to-Left Search,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for Breadth-First, and Depth-First.

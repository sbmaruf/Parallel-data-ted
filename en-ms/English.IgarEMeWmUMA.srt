00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Millions of people were in severe need of help.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it is hard to believe

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that the majority of the world's populous faces:

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
not having detailed maps.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But help was coming.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
At Google, 40 volunteers

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
used a new software

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it took them four days.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to map what we know locally.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
People have used this software

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to map everything from roads to rivers,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
from schools to local businesses,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and video stores to the corner store.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Maps matter.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
recognized that the key to economic liftoff

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
for most developing countries

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
For example, a trillion dollars

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In the last year alone,

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
thousands of users in 170 countries

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
have mapped millions of pieces of information,

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And this was made possible by

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the power of passionate users everywhere.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's look at some of the maps

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
being created by users right now.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in these 170 countries.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is the result of computational geometry,

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
gesture recognition, and machine learning.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is a victory of thousands of users,

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
in hundreds of cities,

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
one user, one edit at a time.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is an invitation to the 70 percent

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of our unmapped planet.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Welcome to the new world.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000

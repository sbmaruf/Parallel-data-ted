00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:05,326
Identify all acute, obtuse, and right angles

2
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:07,303
in the image below.

3
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:08,884
So let's just remind ourselves

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,041
what an acute, obtuse, or right angle is.

5
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,715
An acute angle is an angle that

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,293
is less than 90 degrees.

7
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,504
And I'll right it right under the word acute.

8
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:24,707
A right angle is an angle that is

9
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,235
equal to 90 degrees, or who's measure

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,639
is equal to 90 degrees.

11
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,638
And obtuse angle

12
00:00:30,638 --> 00:00:36,100
is an angle that is greater than 90 degrees,

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,450
greater than 90 degrees, and it is less than 180 degrees.

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,370
Or you could do it this way:

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,908
Greater than 90 degrees, or 90 degrees is

16
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:46,825
less than an obtuse angle.

17
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49,579
And an obtuse angle is less than 180 degrees.

18
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,509
They don't ask us about this, but

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,381
is you have an angle that is

20
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:55,047
180 degrees, it forms a straight line.

21
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:56,903
And that really is called a straight angle.

22
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:58,840
So let's look at this diagram, and

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,636
let's start with the acute angles.

24
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:02,692
And I'll do the acute angles in purple.

25
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:06,541
Ones that we know are less than 90 degrees.

26
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,708
Well, you look over here

27
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,513
the only real information they've given

28
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:12,639
is they've marked this box right over here

29
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,119
that this angle right over here is a

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,540
right angle.

31
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,464
So actually, let's start with the right angle.

32
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:20,136
Because that actually might be a little

33
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:21,203
more interesting.

34
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:22,570
So they tell us that this right over here

35
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,712
is a right angle.

36
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,579
So we already know one of the right angles

37
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,646
is angle QAR.

38
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,126
Where A would be the vertex.

39
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:31,969
You could also call it angle RAQ.

40
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:38,171
So, angle QAR, QAR, hey actually tell us that

41
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:41,902
the measure is 90 degrees, now there's another

42
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,776
90 degree angle here, that is QAT

43
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:50,502
This angle right over here, angle QAT

44
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,130
and the reason why i know that angle QAt

45
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:59,571
is also right, if you take QAR which is this one

46
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:04,903
and combine it with QAT, you actually form a straight angle

47
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:07,319
all the way around like this

48
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,799
and so there some needs to be a 180 degrees

49
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,051
so, QAR is 90 degrees, QAT also has to be 90 degrees

50
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:19,395
anothe way to think about it, is so, is because

51
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:23,306
they're next to each other and has a ray and common

52
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:28,155
they are adjacent angle, and if u were put them

53
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:31,112
and if you look at their outer edges they actually form a straight angle

54
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,970
you will call this two angle,supplementary

55
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,123
or they will add up to 180 degrees

56
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,378
another definition of supplementary, they add up to 180 degrees

57
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:42,873
therefore, if one is 90, the other one has to be 90 degress

58
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:49,040
that all the way, now let's look at the acute angles

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,715
Cause that actually gives us a lot of information

60
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:56,907
Because of this entire angle, if QAT is 90 degrees, then any of the angle

61
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,789
that make up QAT have to be less than 90 degrees

62
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,963
for example, QAP, that angle right over

63
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:08,379
there, the measure of that angle has to be less than 90 degrees

64
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,917
because its part of this larger 90 degrees angle,

65
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:15,169
you have add that two right angle over here, that actually

66
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:19,840
90 degrees, so both of them has to be less than 90 degrees

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,459
so one acute angle is angle QAP,

68
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:32,036
and another cute angle is angle PAT

69
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,869
angle PAT, and once again, we know

70
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,658
that because we add this two angle together you get 90 degrees

71
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:38,048
So each of them have to be less than 90 degrees

72
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:41,782
assuming that this angle are zero degrees

73
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:45,132
now there any other acute angle right over here

74
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:51,971
or another angle that looks acute is angle RAS, angle RAS

75
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,568
an the reason that we can feel pretty good

76
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,638
that it is less than 90 degrees is because

77
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,461
if you keep this line, if AQ is just a ray right now

78
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:04,136
but if u extend all the way, let say u have some

79
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:09,304
mythological point over there called X, angle RAX

80
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:13,393
would be 90 degrees, so RAX is less than that

81
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:17,046
so RAX has to be less that 90 degrees

82
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:20,924
and i think we got all the acute angles here

83
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:22,787
we got the two right angles here

84
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:24,438
now we have to think about the obtuse angle

85
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,504
so it was more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees

86
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:32,510
so one of the obtuse angle, if you went from

87
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:40,769
Q, QAS, or SAQ is definitely an obtuse angle

88
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,703
cause it contains 90 degree angle rather than its even wider than that

89
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:51,842
so, SAQ, angle SAQ is definitely obtuse

90
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:56,846
i'd be tempted to say SAP, but SAP is a straight angle

91
00:04:56,846 --> 00:05:00,793
if you went all the way around like this a 180 degress

92
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:00,793
that would be a straight angle, that's not officially

93
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,851
obtuse angle, i notice, this called a straight angle

94
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:07,375
because it forms from a straight lines but two

95
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,191
rays, two edges of the angle

96
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:14,060
forms a straight line, so not going to include SAP there

97
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,110
now, another obtuse angle, this in a different color

98
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:30,095
this RAP, angle RAP, once again it contains RAQ in it

99
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:36,637
which is 90 degrees which is even wider that that

100
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,784
and let's see, RAT is a straight angle, so for all purposes

101
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:43,101
we will not consider that obtuse.

102
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:48,443
And, have i found everything? am im not missing something?

103
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:53,174
that one, would be straight angles. Oh wait, i just saw

104
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:57,584
one more, of course, you also have this angle over here

105
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:57,584
a big blank spot, and i wasn't paying attention to it

106
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:57,585
you also have this angle TAS

107
00:05:57,585 --> 00:06:09,514
and the reason why we know that it's more than 90 degrees is

108
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:11,516
once again we have our mythological point X over here

109
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:17,723
that we just continue, QA in this direction

110
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:22,557
we would know that this is a 90 degree and TAS is opening up more

111
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,639
than 90 degree angle,

112
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,219
so TAS is also obtuse,

113
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,280
and i think i've got all of them now

114
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,380
Let me see.

115
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,000
Yup, we're done.

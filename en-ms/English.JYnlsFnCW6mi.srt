1
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:14,091
Batu Caves, preparation are underway for the grandest Hindu Festival of the year

2
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:23,046
Thaipusam is about faith, penance and endurance

3
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,086
More than a million devotees are expected

4
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,090
to congregate here over the next few days

5
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:47,081
Five days before Thaipusam we follow a group of

6
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:51,079
50 devotees from the Sri Muniswarar Temple in Puchong

7
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:57,102
as they make their climb up the 272 steps to reach the top of the hill

8
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,088
where the temple is located.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,020
HIgh Priest Vasantha, aged 50 is leading a group of devotees to fulfill their vows

10
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:13,064
and to seek forgiveness for their sins from Lord Murugan

11
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:38,094
She has been doing this for the past 20 years only this year it is a bit different

12
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:45,061
To avoid the heavy traffic, due to a long stretch of public holidays

13
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,091
she is starting early

14
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:56,056
and for many devotees it is never too early to perform this pilgrimage

1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,090
A contractor is purchasing
some stone

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,780
tiles for a new patio.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,140
Each tile costs $3,
and he wants to

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,470
spend less than $1,000.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,340
And it's less than $1,000, not
less than or equal to $1,000.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,750
The size of each tile
is one square foot.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,890
Write an inequality that
represents the number of tiles

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,800
he can purchase with
a $1,000 limit.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,930
And then figure out how large
the stone patio can be.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:35,425
So let x be equal to the number
of tiles purchased.

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,600
And so the cost of purchasing
x tiles, they're going to be

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,520
$3 each, so it's
going to be 3x.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,200
So 3x is going to be the total
cost of purchasing the tiles.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,270
And he wants to spend
less than $1,000.

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,990
3x is how much he spends
if he buys x tiles.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,880
It has to be less than $1,000,
we say it right there.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,060
If it was less than or equal to,
we'd have a little equal

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,160
sign right there.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,190
So if we want to solve for x,
how many tiles can he buy?

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,850
We can divide both sides of
this inequality by 3.

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,710
And because we're dividing or
multiplying-- you could

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,010
imagine we're multiplying by
1/3 or dividing by 3 --

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,600
because this is a positive
number, we do not have to swap

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,010
the inequality sign.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,110
So we are left with x is less
than 1,000 over three, which

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,090
is 333 and 1/3.

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,530
So he has to buy less than 333
and 1/3 tiles, that's how many

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,690
tiles, and each tile
is one square foot.

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:55,640
So if he can buy less than 333
and 1/3 tiles, then the patio

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,320
also has to be less than 333
and 1/3 square feet.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,500
Feet squared, we could
say square feet.

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,270
And we're done.

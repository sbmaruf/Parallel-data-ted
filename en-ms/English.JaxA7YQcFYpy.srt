1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So today, I want us to reflect

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
on the demise of guys.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Guys are flaming out academically;

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
they're wiping out socially with girls

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and sexually with women.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Other than that, there's not much of a problem.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what's the data?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So the data on dropping out is amazing.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to drop out of school.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Girls outperform boys now at every level,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from elementary school to graduate school.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's a 10 percent differential

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
between getting BA's and all graduate programs,

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with guys falling behind girls.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And as you all know,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
boys are five times more likely than girls

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder --

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and therefore we drug them with Ritalin.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's the evidence of wiping out?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Intimacy means physical, emotional connection

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
with somebody else --

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and especially with somebody of the opposite sex

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
who gives off ambiguous, contradictory,

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
phosphorescent signals.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
(Laughter)

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And every year there's research done

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
on self-reported shyness among college students.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And we're seeing a steady increase among males.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And this is two kinds.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a social awkwardness.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The old shyness was a fear of rejection.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
They don't know the language of face contact,

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the non-verbal and verbal set of rules

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
listen to somebody else.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
which tries to account for why guys really prefer

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
male bonding over female mating.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It turns out, from earliest childhood,

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
boys, and then men,

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
prefer the company of guys --

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
physical company.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
because guys have been with guys

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
especially in the military, and then in pubs.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The problem is they now prefer

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
[the] asynchronistic Internet world

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to the spontaneous interaction

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in social relationships.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
excessive new access to pornography.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The problem is these are arousal addictions.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Drug addiction, you simply want more.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Arousal addiction, you want different.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained.

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the problem is the industry is supplying it.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Jane McGonigal told us last year

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that by the time a boy is 21,

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he's played 10,000 hours of video games,

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
most of that in isolation.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As you remember, Cindy Gallop said

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
men don't know the difference

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
between making love and doing porn.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
(Laughter)

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America --

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
15 billion annually.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood,

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
there are 11,000 now made porn videos.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So the effect, very quickly,

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
is it's a new kind of arousal.

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
which are analog, static, interactively passive.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They're also totally out of sync

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
in romantic relationships,

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
which build gradually and subtly.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So what's the solution? It's not my job.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
(Laughter)

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
(Applause)

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But who should care? The only people who should care about this

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
is parents of boys and girls,

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
educators, gamers, filmmakers

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and women who would like a real man

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
who they can talk to, who can dance,

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
who can make love slowly

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and contribute to the evolutionary pressures

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to keep our species above banana slugs.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:25,000
(Applause)

00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,590
Welcome to part two of
the presentation on

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,660
quadratic equations.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,470
Well, I think I thoroughly
confused you the last time

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,170
around, so let me see if I
can fix that a bit by doing

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,770
several more examples.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,765
Entonces comencemos con una revision de lo que

7
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,430
So let's just start with
a review of what the

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,380
quadratic equation is.

9
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,650
The quadratic equation says, if
I'm trying to solve the

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:31,590
equation Ax squared plus Bx
plus C equals 0, then the

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,440
solution or the solutions
because there's usually two

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,970
times that it intersects the
x-axis, or two solutions for

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:47,610
this equation is x equals minus
B plus or minus the square root

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:56,390
of B squared minus
4 times A times C.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,270
And all of that over 2A.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,040
So let's do a problem and
hopefully this should make

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,690
a little more sense.

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,620
That's a 2 on the bottom.

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:13,890
So let's say I had the equation
minus 9x squared minus

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,950
9x plus 6 equals 0.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,230
So in this example what's A?

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,410
Well, A is the coefficient
on the x squared term.

23
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,820
The x squared term is here,
the coefficient is minus 9.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,620
So let's write that.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,120
A equals minus 9.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
What does B equal?

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,180
B is the coefficient on the x
term, so that's this term here.

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,220
So B is also equal to minus 9.

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,140
And C is the constant term,
which in this example is 6.

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,550
So C is equal to 6.

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,070
Now we just substitute these
values into the actual

32
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,260
quadratic equation.

33
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,600
So negative B, so it's
negative times negative 9.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,780
That's B.

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,110
Plus or minus the square root
of B squared, so that's 81.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,390
Right?

37
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,030
Negative 9 squared.

38
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,720
Minus 4 times negative 9.

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,140
That's A.

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,480
Times C, which is 6.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,950
And all of that over 2
times negative 9, which

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,630
is minus 18, right?

43
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,720
2 times negative 9-- 2A.

44
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,760
Let's try to simplify
this up here.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,930
Well, negative negative
9, that's positive 9.

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:46,480
Plus or minus the
square root of 81.

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,900
Let's see.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,270
This is negative 4
times negative 9.

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,470
Negative 4 times negative
9 is positive 36.

50
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,310
And then positive 36
times 6 is-- let's see.

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,330
30 times 6 is 180.

52
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,890
And then 180 plus
another 36 is 216.

53
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,980
Plus 216, is that right?

54
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,490
180 plus 36 is 216.

55
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,840
All of that over 2A.

56
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,570
2A we already said is minus 19.

57
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,740
So we simplify that more.

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:28,090
That's 9 plus or minus the
square root 81 plus 216.

59
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,400
That's 80 plus 217.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,040
That's 297.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,900
And all of that over minus 18.

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,020
Now, this is actually-- the
hardest part with the quadratic

63
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,720
equation is oftentimes just
simplifying this expression.

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,860
We have to figure out if we
can simplify this radical.

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,090
Well, let's see.

66
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,490
One way to figure out if a
number is divisible by 9 is to

67
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,320
actually add up the digits
and see if the digits

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,260
are divisible by 9.

69
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,950
In this case, it is.

70
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,510
2 plus 9 plus 7 is equal to 18.

71
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,600
So let's see how many
times 9 goes into that.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,150
I'll do it on the side here; I
don't want to be too messy.

73
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,450
9 goes into 2 97.

74
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,190
3 times 27.

75
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,040
27-- it goes 33 times, right?

76
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,290
So this is the same thing as 9
plus or minus the square root

77
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:31,110
of 9 times 33 over minus 18.

78
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,470
And 9 is a perfect square.

79
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,650
That's why I actually wanted to
see if 9 would work because

80
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,390
that's the only way I could get
it out of the radical, if

81
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,390
it's a perfect square.

82
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,410
As you learned in that exponent
rules number one module.

83
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,140
So this is equal to 9 plus
or minus 3 times the square

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:53,230
root of 33, and all of
that over minus 18.

85
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,570
We're almost done.

86
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,840
We can actually simplify it
because 9, 3, and minus 18

87
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,650
are all divisible by 3.

88
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,270
Let's divide everything by 3.

89
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:14,370
3 plus or minus the square
root of 33 over minus 6.

90
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,610
And we are done.

91
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,010
So as you see, the hardest
thing with the quadratic

92
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,110
equation is often just
simplifying the expression.

93
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,750
But what we've said, I know you
might have lost track-- we did

94
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,120
all this math-- is we said,
this equation: minus 9x

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,550
squared minus 9x plus 6.

96
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,200
Now we found two x values that
would satisfy this equation

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,970
and make it equal to 0.

98
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,830
One x value is x equals
3 plus the square root

99
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,100
of 33 over minus 6.

100
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,860
And the second value is
3 minus the square root

101
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,160
of 33 over minus 6.

102
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,250
And you might want to
think about why we have

103
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,370
that plus or minus.

104
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,490
We have that plus or minus
because a square root could

105
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,550
actually be a positive
or a negative number.

106
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,180
Let's do another problem.

107
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,890
Hopefully this one will
be a little bit simpler.

108
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:16,780
Let's say I wanted to
solve minus 8x squared

109
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,000
plus 5x plus 9.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,150
Now I'm going to assume that
you've memorized the quadratic

111
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,310
equation because that's
something you should do.

112
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,630
Or you should write it
down on a piece of paper.

113
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,630
But the quadratic equation is
negative B-- So b is 5, right?

114
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,160
We're trying to solve that
equal to 0, so negative B.

115
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,790
So negative 5, plus or minus
the square root of B squared-

116
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,030
that's 5 squared, 25.

117
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,470
Minus 4 times A,
which is minus 8.

118
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,820
Times C, which is 9.

119
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,400
And all of that over 2 times A.

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,320
Well, A is minus 8, so all
of that is over minus 16.

121
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,090
So let's simplify this
expression up here.

122
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,440
Well, that's equal to
minus 5 plus or minus

123
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,630
the square root of 25.

124
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,620
Let's see.

125
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,220
4 times 8 is 32 and the
negatives cancel out, so

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,520
that's positive 32 times 9.

127
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,480
Positive 32 times 9, let's see.

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,720
30 times 9 is 270.

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,110
It's 288.

130
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,570
I think.

131
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,800
Right?

132
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,490
288.

133
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,590
We have all of that
over minus 16.

134
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,560
Now simplify it more.

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,760
Minus 5 plus or minus the
square root-- 25 plus

136
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,340
288 is 313 I believe.

137
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,230
And all of that over minus 16.

138
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,430
And I think, I'm not 100% sure,
although I'm pretty sure.

139
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,570
I haven't checked it.

140
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,370
That 313 can't be factored
into a product of a perfect

141
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,690
square and another number.

142
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,670
In fact, it actually
might be a prime number.

143
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,600
That's something that you
might want to check out.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
So if that is the case and
we've got it in completely

145
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,840
simplified form, and we say
there are two solutions, two

146
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,940
x values that will make
this equation true.

147
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,750
One of them is x is equal
to minus 5 plus the square

148
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,830
root of 313 over minus 16.

149
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:44,110
And the other one is x is equal
to minus 5 minus the square

150
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,660
root of 313 over minus 16.

151
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,760
Hopefully those two examples
will give you a good

152
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,940
sense of how to use the
quadratic equation.

153
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,860
I might add some more modules.

154
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,230
And then, once you master this,
I'll actually teach you how to

155
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,370
solve quadratic equations when
you actually get a negative

156
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,910

Very interesting.

158
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,760
Anyway, I hope you can do the

159
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,370
few more presentations because
this isn't the easiest module.

160
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,840
But I hope you have fun.

161
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,140
Bye.

00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:27,183
Episode 13.

3
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:30,613
You arrived, Seung Jo-goon.

4
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:36,003
Hi, Baek Seung Jo.

5
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:43,133
Sit down.

6
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:49,001
You don't have to be that surprised. I was surprised too when I heard you were my prospective marriage partner.

7
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,567
"I would never have a marriage meeting"

8
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:58,893
I was positive there would be no way I would marry a man my grandpa picked out for me.

9
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,667
Because of you, now I look funny.

10
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:04,916
I, too, had no idea that Hae Ra and you knew each other.

11
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:08,087
Yes, we go to the same school and are the same year. We're friends.

12
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:14,097
I did think it was weird that I got her to come out so easily.

13
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:18,918
But it seems there is a destiny between you and Hae Ra.

14
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:20,533
Then, let's have something to eat first.

15
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,516
Ah, yes.

16
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,631
Hae Ra, choose something delicious to eat.

17
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,167
Yes, Grandfather.

18
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,889
Seung Jo you also choose what you like.

19
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:27,911
Yes.

20
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:31,001
Oh, Seung Jo doesn't really like oily food.

21
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,914
What do you think about this set meal? It doesn't seem to be too much food either.

22
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:35,833
That sounds good.

23
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:42,567
Aigoo, you already get along well just like a married couple.

24
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:47,933
I'm sorry if I have made you uncomfortable. I will be leaving early.

25
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,533
What's the matter? Do you have something else to do?

26
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:57,084
Do you think this grandfather doesn't have any sense?

27
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,267
Baek Seung Jo!

28
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,009
Hey, Seung Jo!Mother.

29
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,567
Ha Ni, where is Seung Jo?

30
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,467
He went out.

31
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,233
He went out?

32
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:13,067
He said he had an appointment, dressed well, and went out.

33
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:29,833
But why?

34
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,548
You were surprised right?

35
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:33,733
Yeah...

36
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,467
A bit.

37
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:40,633
You seem to have delighted my grandpa.

38
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:46,267
That was the first time he brought a picture and told me to take a look at a guy.

39
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,007
Of course at first, I didn't even look.

40
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:53,051
But then he said that he was the heir of a successful game company.

41
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,033
And when I saw the picture it was really you!

42
00:02:55,033 --> 00:03:01,767
But how can I not go when it's you? And it would be so much fun?!

43
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,001
I wanted to see your expression.

44
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:07,331
How was it?

45
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:15,000
Your expression was... bitter

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, what do we do next?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,609
If we want to be funded by your grandfather...

48
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,733
Does that mean I need to get married?

49
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,346
With you?

50
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,567
Well, that's possible too.

51
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:37,633
But you wouldn't like that, right?

52
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:59,437
Wouldn't you be the one to not like it?

53
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,267
Hey! What are you doing acting like a kid?

54
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:03,733
Do you have a handkerchief?

55
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:18,267
I don't.

56
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:22,003
In the condition we're in now, a game can't be released.

57
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:25,833
We're even behind on employees' salaries.

58
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,369
That's why I came out today.

59
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:33,733
But, since you're the other person, I'm actually relieved.

60
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:39,167
But don't you dislike it? Since it's for that reason?

61
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:44,167
I didn't know these kind of words can come out of Baek Seung Jo's mouth.

62
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,467
Really?

63
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:50,867
Living is pretty extreme. It's no joke.

64
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:56,133
But, I came out because it was you.

65
00:04:56,133 --> 00:05:02,007
You came and you were relieved that it was me, but I

66
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:05,033
came because it was you,

67
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:08,933
even though I knew why you came.

68
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:16,133
Hey, since I knew the real reason, my pride was hurt so I did actually say that I didn't want to come.

69
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:23,533
But when this morning came around, I wanted to come out looking pretty.

70
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:30,167
Doesn't it seem like I really like you?

71
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:40,003
But don't worry. Even though the situation seems real, I don't want to go that far.

72
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:47,067
Let's just take a chance... on each other.

73
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:52,006
Let's try it out...

74
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:56,079
Okay, it's good.

75
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,935
Really?

76
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:05,379
Really?!

77
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,881
It's alright. Be strong.

78
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:15,118
Right now those people are probably just seeing his fright.But once they see his true colors, they'll probably say no first.

79
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:22,146
He's not humane, he's no fun, and he's not good to the ladies.

80
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,746
How is Seung Jo's dad doing lately?

81
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:31,218
He is getting better.

82
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:34,079
I'm back.

83
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,518
Let's talk for a bit Baek Seung Jo.

84
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:39,579
Aren't you going to Father at the hospital?

85
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,255
Just go. We'll talk next time.

86
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:44,246
Aigoo, look at that brat.

87
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:47,713
Who would like someone that cold?

88
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:51,679
You're probably the only person that can handle that temper of his.

89
00:06:51,679 --> 00:07:06,713
Be strong, okay?

90
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:10,046
You came back early.

91
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,479
Yeah...

92
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,085
I can't?

93
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:17,913
Excuse me...

94
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:20,546
You had a marriage meeting?

95
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:22,546
Yeah.

96
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:26,146
How was it?

97
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,646
Did you hear who it was with?

98
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,457
Hae Ra.

99
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:34,679
I heard it was the granddaughter of Windy Media.

100
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,513
Yeah.

101
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:43,946
Pretty perfect, isn't it?

102
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:49,513
Will you...get married?

103
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:54,046
Get married?

104
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:55,546
Probably.

105
00:07:55,546 --> 00:09:28,556
Marriage naturally follows a marriage meeting.

106
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,242
Ha Ni!

107
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:34,913
Oh! Ha Ni!

108
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:37,513
What happened now?

109
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:43,146
I guess something happened again.

110
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:47,813
Ha Ni, why do you look so down again?

111
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:53,279
Was Baek Seung Jo mean to you again?

112
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,579
Did you get kicked out of Seung Jo's company?

113
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:00,346
I said I was sick and that I was going to take a day off today.

114
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:04,479
So, you're really sick?

115
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:11,346
You should go to the hospital if you're sick. Why did you come to school?

116
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:14,846
It hurts here.

117
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,813
Why?

118
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:20,846
It's because there's going to be a marriage .

119
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:21,879
Marriage?

120
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,979
Who?

121
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:26,146
With who?!

122
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,146
Maybe... Baek Seung Jo?!

123
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,213
Who's the other person?

124
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,813
Yoon Hae Ra.

125
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:33,746
What?

126
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,446
Yoon Hae Ra?!

127
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:39,446
Why suddenly with Yoon Hae Ra?

128
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:42,113
It was a marriage meeting.

129
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:45,879
One of the big investors of the company, she's his granddaughter.

130
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,279
Oh my goodness.

131
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,613
Yoon Hae Ra is no ordinary girl.

132
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:53,379
Hey...

133
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,946
So are they going to get married?

134
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,546
He said he likes the idea.

135
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:03,413
It's the first time I heard Seung Jo say something like that.

136
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,567
Hey! That's good then!

137
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,433
Now, you can completely forget someone like Baek Seung Jo.

138
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:22,017
And you can meet a good guy.

139
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:25,018
Excuse me, President.

140
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,087
How did the meeting go with the chairman's granddaughter?

141
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,737
Fine.

142
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:33,603
I heard that you two already knew each other.

143
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:36,803
Yes, that's true.

144
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:40,603
President Yoon seems to like you quite a lot as a groom.

145
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,077
Is the Powerpoint tutorial going well?

146
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:48,097
Oh yes, we're working on it right now.

147
00:11:48,097 --> 00:12:02,803
Ah, yes. Then, I'll be leaving.

148
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,067
<i>Even if you're busy, don't skip meals. Fighting.

149
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:34,027
<i>Acting like a girlfriend...

150
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:41,537
You've got a text.

151
00:12:41,537 --> 00:13:05,403
<i>Looks like you're taking a leave of absence. I'll take it from today's salary.

152
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:19,007
Hello!

153
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,937
Really delicious.

154
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:21,437
Really!

155
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:22,097
Did you make it all by yourself?

156
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:25,636
Of course. I made the soup base on my own, and made the noddles too!

157
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:29,067
This whole bowl I made all with my power.

158
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,047
How did you already...

159
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:34,103
You're amazing Bong Joon Gu.

160
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:39,017
I wanted to let you have the first noodles that I made.

161
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:43,017
Before I started working, I washed my hands throughly and prepared my heart.

162
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,437
I put all my passion into it.

163
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:47,097
What am I that you'd go that far for me?

164
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:51,097
What do you mean what are you? If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even wash my face.

165
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,437
It's really true.

166
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:58,047
Since I never know when you're coming, I dress nicely, wash my hair everday, and work hard at learning how to cook.

167
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:02,303
To put it in one sentence, Ha Ni, you are the reason that I live.

168
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:04,303
Thank you.

169
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:08,937
Since you're saying that to me, I feel like a special person.

170
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:11,097
And this is really delicious.

171
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:15,057
You're really cool. You did well Bong Joon Gu.

172
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:21,103
Really?

173
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:31,703
If you think that, we should go on a date sometime..

174
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:36,137
It would be good to go on a date...

175
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:39,017
Ok, let's do it.

176
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,837
Let's go on a date.

177
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:45,097
Re..really?

178
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:50,057
Rea... Really? For real?

179
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,047
Date, date.

180
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,903
Ha Ni, thank you!

181
00:14:54,903 --> 00:15:10,337
When will we go on one? When will we go on the date?

182
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,703
Where is Ha Ni?

183
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,437
She is going on a date.

184
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:14,403
Date?

185
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,737
She really dolled herself up before leaving.

186
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:21,087
A red coat, and red shoes. She went out completely in red.

187
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,237
Really?

188
00:15:23,237 --> 00:16:02,017
Sounds like she went with a guy with strange tastes.

189
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:08,037
Ha Ni! <BR> Here, here!

190
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:10,007
Did you come early?

191
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,737
No, it has been about 3 hours?

192
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:15,037
What?

193
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,803
Did I get the time wrong?

194
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:21,077
No, it's not that. At home, I kept looking at the clock but it felt like it wasn't moving.

195
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,937
So I just came.

196
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:26,037
I see.

197
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:28,037
You really came.

198
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:31,803
I'm so touched that I feel like I'm going to die.

199
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:35,237
Ha Ni is very pretty today.

200
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,017
Where are we going now?

201
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:41,027
First, the basics of a date...

202
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:45,537
Let's watch a movie first. It was a wish of mine to watch a movie with you.

203
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,237
I did too...

204
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:50,737
Oh, I really wanted to see this movie.

205
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,037
Is that right? I thought so that's why I got it.

206
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:57,057
Let's go in.

207
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:01,303
You want some popcorn?

208
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,703
Here's the Giant Combo.

209
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:04,337
Let's go!

210
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:07,303
<i>My beating heart

211
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:11,837
<i>Is a mess like my room

212
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:19,103
<i>I just can't get a hold of it

213
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:25,403
Take this.

214
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:26,637
How is it?

215
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:34,203
It's delicious.

216
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:35,837
How is it?

217
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:42,437
<i>For your own sake, forget all about me

218
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:49,087
<i>I will call you, you

219
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:52,737
<i>I wish to marry you

220
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:56,007
<i>I wish to kiss you

221
00:17:56,007 --> 00:18:00,103
<i>I wish to steal your heart

222
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:03,403
-Should I put it in (your hair?) -I don't want it.

223
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:06,337


224
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,537
It's pretty, why not?

225
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,203
Do you want to take a picture?

226
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,303
- Watch, watch!- Hey!

227
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:14,337
Hey!

228
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:17,737
I'm sorry, but can you take one picture for us?

229
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:22,017
-Hey! -Here.

230
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:28,737
-You do it too, you do it too. <BR> -Okay okay.

231
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:31,537
<i>My beating heart

232
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:35,077
<i>Like my messy room

233
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:36,703
Marriage?

234
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:37,062
Yes.

235
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:42,003
I found out that the both of them got into Parang University ranked 1st or 2nd in their schools.

236
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:45,103
During some point in high school,

237
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,361
I heard that they met once at a tennis tournament.

238
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,003
Yes.

239
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,057
It's a match made in heaven isn't it?!

240
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:55,603
If that's why you think so, then every couple is a match made in heaven!

241
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:58,537
For a couple to be a match made in--

242
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:04,077
But this goes for both Seung Jo and Hae Ra. Maybe after they finish their studies--

243
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:08,037
Can they not study after they get married?

244
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:13,037
I'm thinking it might be nice if they study abroad.

245
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:18,067
If those two get married think about how talented their children would be?

246
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:22,737
Doing business and all, I've learned that people are the most important factor.

247
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:28,057
One smart person can do the work of 100 people.

248
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:34,203
Chairman Baek, no need to worry about money now. Just carry on with your company.

249
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:38,037
Yes.

250
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:58,736
<i> Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

251
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:02,703
Baek Seung Jo! Yoon Hae Ra!

252
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,137
Laugh while you can!

253
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:15,803
After today, living will suck.

254
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:17,503
It's very entertaining.

255
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:31,596
Keep going.

256
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,103
Ah, I'm so full.

257
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:36,626
I was going to buy dinner.

258
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:41,075
What are you talking about? The man usually pays for the meals.

259
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,733
Today was fun.

260
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,183
The movie was fun as well.

261
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,264
I also had a great time.

262
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:57,624
This is the best day of my life.

263
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:01,009
Ha Ni, your smiling face is the best thing in the world.

264
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,233
If I got to see your smiling face everyday,

265
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:10,766
I'd probably be full even if I didn't eat.

266
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:11,756
Why?

267
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:16,896
Is there something on my face?

268
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:25,634
Then, am I being strange?

269
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:28,599
Thank you.

270
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,036
Ha Ni.

271
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:36,301
You really are a good person.

272
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,833
I already knew...

273
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:43,533
but I really feel it these days.

274
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,833
Ha Ni, have you ever been to the Han river?

275
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,136
I haven't been there at night.

276
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,424
I haven't been there since I came up from Busan.

277
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:50,077
Do you want to go?

278
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:56,667
Okay.

279
00:21:56,667 --> 00:22:00,933
Wah! The Han River is so pretty!

280
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:08,282
It is.

281
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:11,537
Your mind is everywhere these days, isn't it?

282
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,467
Is the game development going okay?

283
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:16,788
My grandpa said that the idea was really good.

284
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:17,809
It's just okay.

285
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,042
I'm going to go at it like a blue frog.

286
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,449
Blue frog?

287
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:23,833
Since everyone is always saying 3D, 3D,

288
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,711
I'm planning to do something different from 3D.

289
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,008
Like an animation.

290
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:29,348
That's great.

291
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:34,278
Everyone's always talking about how to make a game more realistic,

292
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,767
An animation type of game .

293
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,233
That's contrarian.

294
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,006
That's exactly it. Contrarian.

295
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:46,018
Taking the game's weakest point and making it into the strongest.

296
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:49,363
I'm thinking about making it look like an animation.

297
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:54,761
There was a reason that my Grandpa was so interested.

298
00:22:54,761 --> 00:23:03,001
He's really into you.

299
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:06,567
Do you want to go to a jazz bar in a little bit?

300
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:11,267
Omo, omo. Ha Ni, let's get going.

301
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,294
Wow, is this really the Han river?

302
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:14,005
It's really pretty.

303
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:17,087
Ha Ni, what's this lit up area?

304
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,533
It seems like it's a cafe.

305
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,833
Cafe?

306
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,867
Then, let's go inside the cafe.

307
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,833
Should we have a caramel macchiato?

308
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:26,633
Okay..

309
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:27,003
Really...

310
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:28,833
Let's go.

311
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,133
Let's go.

312
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,667
The cafe is really pretty.

313
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:37,462
This is the first time I've been someplace like this in my life.

314
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:40,633
If I didn't know you, I would have never come here.

315
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:43,004
These places come out on dramas.

316
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,001
Do you like it?

317
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:49,205
I really like today.

318
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:57,833
Ha Ni, aren't you cold? You should have dressed warmly.

319
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,233
Oh, Baek Seung Jo

320
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,000
You're on a date?

321
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,167
Can you not see?

322
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,367
Hey looking at you two, it looks like you're having a good time too.

323
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:11,367
Yeah. It's good.

324
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,000
Could it be that Seoul is that small?

325
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,567
How did we run into one another here?

326
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:16,667
I wonder...

327
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,633
Ah! You wanna go together?

328
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:22,003
We're going to a jazz bar.

329
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,533
It's just a casual place.

330
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,433
Jazz?

331
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:28,033
What's wrong? It'll be annoying for all of us.

332
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,009
You guys should go to some place like an arcade.

333
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:32,233
Isn't that more comfortable?

334
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,167
Hey, what are you implying?

335
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:37,867
We have ears too and we know how to listen to music as well.

336
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:41,433
That's right. You know me quite well.

337
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,767
Let's go somewhere else, Joon Gu.

338
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:43,733
Sure.

339
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,566
Oh Ha Ni...

340
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:52,233
You look quite good together.

341
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,004
Really?

342
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:55,633
Does it really look that way?

343
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:59,767
You guys are a match made in heaven too! You and your nasty personalities look perfect together!

344
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,833
Let's go.

345
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:35,041
Good bye!

346
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,002
Ha Ni...

347
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,533
What?

348
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,233
Ah...

349
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:42,006
Wow!

350
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:47,001
It's so pretty!

351
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:50,833
It's really pretty.

352
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,867
Thank you

353
00:25:52,867 --> 00:26:13,133
for bringing me here.

354
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:15,367
Marry me.

355
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,667
What?

356
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,767
What I'm saying is...

357
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:34,367
marry me.

358
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,003
Why?

359
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:39,005
Do you not have hands?

360
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:42,003
You'd probably say that if I were Ha Ni.

361
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:44,633
Probably.

362
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:48,007
Why are you so mean to Ha Ni?

363
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:52,267
Well...

364
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,433
Oh, am I weird?

365
00:26:54,433 --> 00:27:08,533
Why do I feel that it'd be nice if you were mean to me too?

366
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:21,667
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

367
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,007
Will you...

368
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:28,001
marry me?

369
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,367
Bong Joon Gu.

370
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,033
I look at you,

371
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,267
and you look at Baek Seung Jo.

372
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:37,000
It's already been 4 years of that.

373
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,333
Of course...

374
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:43,033
I can wait however long for you.

375
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:45,067
But, Baek Seung Jo...

376
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,567
he's found someone else now.

377
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,003
Both looking at someone else's back like that...

378
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,667
let's stop that now, Ha Ni.

379
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,004
All you have to do it is turn around.

380
00:27:57,004 --> 00:28:00,967
If you just turn around...

381
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:04,007
I'm right here.

382
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:06,002
Joon Gu...

383
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,967
Let's get married,

384
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:26,167
Ha Ni.

385
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:30,009
He's late.

386
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:36,000
What is he doing right now?

387
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,004
Jazz bar.

388
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:46,005
It must be fun.

389
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:58,367
I'm thinking of Baek Seung Jo again.

390
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,233
You were home.

391
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:03,067
What time is it right now?!

392
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:04,932
11 o'clock.

393
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:07,767
What have you done until now?

394
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,002
You go to a marriage meeting without even telling us.

395
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:12,004
I heard you went on a date again.

396
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,167
What are you planning to do?

397
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:17,003
What are you doing right now?

398
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,733
He said he's fine, so what's wrong with you?

399
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,933
You don't have to do that. Your father's fine.

400
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:23,006
I'm not doing it because of Father.

401
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:25,000
What a liar.

402
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,002
You're doing this for your father's company.

403
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:29,367
Me?

404
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,000
No way.

405
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,033
You really don't know your son?

406
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:33,933
Then,

407
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:40,867
what's the reason to keep seeing President Yoon's granddaughter?

408
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,009
Are you really curious?

409
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,733
Because I like her.

410
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:49,633
What?!

411
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:50,833
That makes no sense.

412
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,133
That reason is enough right?

413
00:29:53,133 --> 00:30:08,267
You... Baek Seung Jo.

414
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,733
Welcome back.

415
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:10,008
You're late.

416
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,167
You came early.

417
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,233
You looked good together.

418
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:18,567
Yes, it was good.

419
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,967
It was fun, and he was nice.

420
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:25,006
Unlike someone, he wasn't mean to me.

421
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:28,001
I liked it.

422
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,009
That's good then.

423
00:30:29,009 --> 00:31:07,207
Good luck to you.

424
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:14,034
What? A proposal?

425
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,477
Bong Joon Gu is amazing.

426
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:18,056
Marriage?

427
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:19,844
So, what did you say?

428
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,421
What did you say?

429
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:25,003
I didn't say anything.

430
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:27,033
What is this?

431
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:30,864
I know that Joon Gu is a really good person,

432
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:32,459
but still...

433
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,767
I don't have those feelings for him.

434
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:39,897
Even when I received that sudden proposal...

435
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:42,429
I was a little surprised.

436
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,072
But since it passed, I just calmed down.

437
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,656
Hey...

438
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:49,883
where is there a person who thinks about you as much as Joon Gu?

439
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:50,991
Yeah.

440
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,902
Hey, honestly speaking,

441
00:31:52,902 --> 00:31:55,224
instead of Baek Seung Jo,

442
00:31:55,224 --> 00:32:06,667
you look much better with Bong Joon Gu.

443
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,902
Baek Seung Jo

444
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:11,362
is getting married with Yoon Hae Ra.

445
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,057
Yeah, Ha Ni.

446
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:16,865
This time, think carefully about Bong Joon Gu.

447
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,465
He looked at only you for four years.

448
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:23,343
You probably know how Joon Gu feels, better than anyone.

449
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:26,158
You know what I'm saying right?

450
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:43,528
Okay.

451
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,477
Black?

452
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,661
- It's pretty. - Ah, Seung Jo.

453
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,929
Which one is better?

454
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:51,555
The white one.

455
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,366
I think so too.

456
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:54,922
Should I wrap them together?

457
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:57,128
Please do it separately.

458
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:58,937
I'll pay for it.

459
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,154
Really?

460
00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:01,951
Thank you.

461
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:03,948
Ah! Then, I'll buy dinner.

462
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,004
I know of a few places.

463
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:09,411
<i>The person that looks good with me</i>

464
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,223
<i>is not Baek Seung Jo,</i>

465
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:14,225
<i>and it could be Bong Joon Gu.</i>

466
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,297
<i>Even if I don't get excited, he's comfortable,</i>

467
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:30,179
<i>like family.</i>

468
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,716
I see you again.

469
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:38,761
Are you shopping?

470
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:42,198
We're going to go eat dinner.

471
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:44,474
Really?

472
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:47,399
Do you want to come with us?

473
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,861
Oh...

474
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,347
Shall we?

475
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:54,005
Yes, let's go together.

476
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:56,084
Whatever you choose.

477
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:58,452
It's not like I'm begging you to come with us.

478
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:19,911
Yes, let's go together.

479
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:22,019
Are you going to look at those all day?

480
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,226
Oh, Chef! I'm sorry.

481
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:25,108
Clean it up.

482
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:32,004
Yes!

483
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,368
Welco...

484
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:38,887
Welcome.

485
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:39,719
Dad.

486
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,754
Oh! Ha Ni!

487
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:44,715
Hello.

488
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,051
Come in.

489
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:51,167
This place...Ha Ni, this is your...

490
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,067
Yeah.

491
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:52,803
Yeah that's right.

492
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:54,475
Oh Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu...

493
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,291
This place has 60 years of tradition, So Pal Bok Noodles, which Oh Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu will be taking on!

494
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:00,287
Ah, but you're friends?

495
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:08,344
Friends, Chef? They're getting married.

496
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:10,402
Is that so?

497
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:13,104
Sit... sit down please.

498
00:35:13,104 --> 00:35:16,416
I looked it up on the Internet and decided to come here.

499
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,607
Your restaurant is really pretty.

500
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:24,807
Ah, yes.

501
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:27,554
Wow pretty.

502
00:35:27,554 --> 00:35:30,148
It's so pretty it feels like a waste to eat it.

503
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:32,562
Since this rascal came, our chef

504
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:34,188
made something special.

505
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:35,465
Of course.

506
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:38,175
If it's Seung Jo and his friend, then they're VIP.

507
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:39,249
Please eat a lot.

508
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:44,158
Yes. I'll eat well.

509
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:48,305
Ah look at this, look at this. You don't even know how to eat it.

510
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:50,072
With this Pyongyang Neng Myun...

511
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:54,025
you put the vinegar right onto the noodles.

512
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:57,454
And after waiting a little bit for the noodles to soak up the vinegar...

513
00:35:57,454 --> 00:36:01,912
you pull them apart and eat them.

514
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,554
Ohhh.

515
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:05,954
Oh, it's like that. I didn't know either.

516
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:12,567
Really? Well it's okay to not know. A lot of people don't. Eat a lot!

517
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:15,346
Makes me look at him differently.

518
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:17,423
You must be happy, Oh Ha Ni.

519
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:21,463
Since your boyfriend knows a lot.

520
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:24,552
I can't use chopsticks very well.

521
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:34,486
You can't make fun of me for using them strangely.

522
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:35,365
Ha Ni.

523
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:37,023
What are you looking at like that?

524
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:41,727
Seung Jo's face will fall off.

525
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:43,036
<i>Your Imagination Will Become A Game.

526
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,084
Your imagination will become a game.

527
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:50,094
We've portrayed many fun features for users within this game.

528
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:52,274


529
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:55,102
It's a stylish action with top notch visuals.

530
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:56,727
With the various missions systems,

531
00:36:56,727 --> 00:36:59,288
users can enjoy different levels of enjoyment through the game.

532
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:01,061
Especially because our games style concept differs from other games.

533
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:02,864
Action game...

534
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:05,007
That's the focus and the factor that will differentiate our game.

535
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:09,173
Then, I will show the demo version.

536
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:14,902
You have all just experienced the world of imagination.

537
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:21,762
Just like he said, it looks like an animated movie.

538
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:24,816
It must not have been easy, but you finished in a short time period.

539
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:30,877
It was due to the late nights that the employees worked.

540
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:33,569
-You worked hard. -Goodbye.

541
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:34,885
You worked hard.

542
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,145
Should I ask Hae Ra to come out so that we can go eat somewhere?

543
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:39,606
I'm sorry.

544
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:41,851
Today is the day that my father gets discharged from the hospital,

545
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,871
so I have to go home and eat dinner at home.

546
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,404
Ah is that so?

547
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:47,122
Then the timing is good!

548
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:49,992
I'll ask Hae Ra to go over there.

549
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:54,483
She needs to give her greetings now that he's out of the hospital.

550
00:37:54,483 --> 00:38:00,241
Seung Jo, your mother came out.

551
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:03,724
-Hello.-Yes.

552
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:10,922
Why are you here? Come here.

553
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,469
I've met you once before.

554
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:15,373
I'm Yoon Hae Ra.

555
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,006
Oh is that so?

556
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:19,792
It seems like I've seen you before,

557
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:23,291
but I guess your impression wasn't that great.

558
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,297
Ah!

559
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:28,848
You know that Ha Ni and Seung Jo are living together right?

560
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,385
Yes, of course.

561
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:36,046
Oh my, you bought cake.

562
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:39,651
He's (father) forbidden to eat anything sweet.

563
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,119
And Seung Jo doesn't like sweet things.

564
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,053
I bought it, so that you could eat it.

565
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:50,536
Oh, really?

566
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,615
These are rice cakes.

567
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:57,502
It's set to eat comfortably.

568
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,732
Please eat it once.

569
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:01,001
She is different from Oh Ha Ni.

570
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,192
What about rice cakes?

571
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:05,512
Even if it's simple, rice cakes are rice cakes.

572
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:12,255
Shall I eat cake?

573
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:14,406
Then please talk.

574
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:18,446
I should go in and lay down.

575
00:39:18,446 --> 00:39:47,919
Me too.

576
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:54,937
Seung Jo.

577
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,821
He is my son,

578
00:39:56,821 --> 00:40:01,078
but Seung Jo has a very tiring temper.

579
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:04,305
He's self centered and naughty...

580
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:05,768
And he's no fun.

581
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,463
That's not true.

582
00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:08,787
He is fun.

583
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:09,716
And he can converse well.

584
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:11,666
You too...

585
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:14,499
must be a boring style.

586
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:18,121
You talk back well and only talk about things from books.

587
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:19,538
You must be like that?

588
00:40:19,538 --> 00:40:22,138
Yes, you're right.

589
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:26,055
We're both rational and logical.

590
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:30,405
But even though people look at us like that,

591
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:33,509
it's fun for us.

592
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:37,671
More than that, he is not good to women.

593
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:40,173
He doesn't say a single nice thing.

594
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:46,078
He's the type of person to fix someone's love letter and give it back.

595
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,438
Really?

596
00:40:48,438 --> 00:40:50,676
I've done that before too.

597
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:54,089
Wow really? You really did that before?

598
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,807
Yes.

599
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:59,476
You guys must be one of a kind.

600
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:02,627
Baek Seung Jo seems like he's smart, right?

601
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,467
But, he's dumb.

602
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:08,369
He doesn't know his own feelings.

603
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,681
If he likes someone, he's colder to them and hurts them more.

604
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,003
And he pushes them away. That's what I see.

605
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:21,512
That means he's scared. People's feelings...

606
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,802
can't be solved easily like a math equation.

607
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:26,922
that he might get caught.

608
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:28,367
Are you like that too?

609
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:49,707
Mother!

610
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,673
You're childish.

611
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:52,306
What? Childish?

612
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:55,173
I won't say anything about you liking Oh Ha Ni.

613
00:41:55,173 --> 00:41:59,407
But, why are you pushing me to like her as well?

614
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:01,007
Were my words wrong?

615
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:02,707
You are my son.

616
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:04,014
I know you.

617
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:05,373
But you don't know yourself.

618
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:06,507
Even if I don't,

619
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,073
Let me do things the way I want.

620
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:09,073
Beak Seung Jo.

621
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:11,074
My career and even my love life.

622
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:12,973
Please stop your meddling.

623
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:16,253
Meddling?

624
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:18,407
I have always respected your decisions.

625
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:20,107
Isn't that so?

626
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,547
But what is this?

627
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,723
You obviously know Ha Ni's feelings and you still brought her to our house!

628
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:26,073
This is a problem with courtesy among people.

629
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:28,084
Are you a kid that doesn't have courtesy?

630
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:31,207
Mother,

631
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:32,064
I'm fine.

632
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:34,073
Now, please

633
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,642
Would you stop this!

634
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:38,673
Baek Seung Jo, you!

635
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:41,004
Right.

636
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:52,976
Since you have always respected my decision, please do so this time as well.

637
00:42:52,976 --> 00:43:01,807
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

638
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:07,107
I thought that Seung Jo really liked Ha Ni.

639
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:13,004
Since he is my son I believed that he would eventually come to like her.

640
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:15,094
You can't control your kids like that.

641
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:19,084
But don't those two really suit each other well?

642
00:43:19,084 --> 00:43:24,207
They fill the missing spots and share what they have too much of.

643
00:43:24,207 --> 00:43:25,873
Isn't it really like that?

644
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:28,273
That's how I see it too,

645
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:32,107
but Seung Jo is not going that way. What can we do?

646
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:34,054
What to do?

647
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:45,325
I feel like I did something bad to both Seung Jo and Ha Ni.

648
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:48,158
He likes her.

649
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:48,054
What?

650
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:51,073
Hyung likes Oh Ha Ni.

651
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:52,807
So don't cry, Mom.

652
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:56,273
Eun Jo! What are you talking about?

653
00:43:56,273 --> 00:44:05,473
Baek Eun Jo!

654
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:10,007
Hyung...

655
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:14,074
Are you really going to get married to Hae Ra?

656
00:44:14,074 --> 00:44:19,107
Isn't she pretty? You like pretty Nunas.

657
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:22,307
Do you like that Nuna?

658
00:44:22,307 --> 00:44:25,273
Won't it turn out like that, if we keep going on?

659
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:26,973
But still!

660
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:29,907
Still, the person you like is . . .

661
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:33,307
That nuna is a woman that suits me very well.

662
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:36,807
She is smart, and she can play tennis well too.

663
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:37,044
Hyung!

664
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:55,907
If you meet her for a couple more times, you'll definitely like her.

665
00:44:55,907 --> 00:45:16,084
Liar.

666
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:19,373
Sleeping in a place like this...

667
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:23,307
She's really carefree.

668
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:25,373
Right!

669
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:28,094
A bug on top of her hand?

670
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:36,573
Oh Ha Ni, you'll be surprised for sure.

671
00:45:36,573 --> 00:46:28,473
Oh!

672
00:46:28,473 --> 00:46:47,034
<i> Then hyung went back to the pension.

673
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:49,064
So it was a dream!

674
00:46:49,064 --> 00:47:00,973
<i> H..hyung kissed Oh Ha Ni.

675
00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:03,873
After doing that...

676
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:07,084
I saw everything.

677
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:21,307
But still I can't tell that to Mom.

678
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:27,054
Hyung is saying it isn't so.

679
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:31,054
But this is for sure.

680
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:46,024
Hyung likes Oh Ha Ni.

681
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:52,473
Is something going wrong?

682
00:47:52,473 --> 00:47:59,054
No. There isn't anything that's going well or anything that's going wrong

683
00:47:59,054 --> 00:48:03,407
I'm just playing.

684
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:06,573
What is this, genius Yoon He Ra?

685
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:14,014
Should Grandpa put some speed into it?

686
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:16,307
Put speed?

687
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:20,024
Yeah, we're the ones that pulled the knife.

688
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:23,873
He's the one that's supposed to be trying, not us.

689
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:25,074
I don't want it, Grandpa.

690
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:29,084
Scaring someone to make them do something, that hurts my pride more.

691
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:31,573
Really?

692
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:33,673
Then should Grandpa just stay still?

693
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:35,307
Yeah. For now.

694
00:48:35,307 --> 00:48:38,307
If I really think there's nothing I can do,

695
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:41,673
then I might ask you to use a knife.

696
00:48:41,673 --> 00:48:44,074
Yeah. Don't hold it in.

697
00:48:44,074 --> 00:48:53,084
I won't hold back.

698
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:55,607
Baek Eun Jo...

699
00:48:55,607 --> 00:49:05,084
I made the pudding that you like!

700
00:49:05,084 --> 00:49:14,673
Here! Eat it.

701
00:49:14,673 --> 00:49:18,034
Is it good?

702
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:19,807
That's a relief.

703
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:23,014
But, Eun Jo...

704
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:26,673
what was that you told me before,

705
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:30,373
about Seung Jo liking Ha Ni.

706
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:31,373
I'm not eating anymore.

707
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:35,607
Ah, why?

708
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:42,607
You're hiding something aren't you? Come here!

709
00:49:42,607 --> 00:49:49,307
Maybe because the weather is clear today, there are many stars in the sky.

710
00:49:49,307 --> 00:49:51,773
Dad.

711
00:49:51,773 --> 00:49:56,873
What do you think about me dating Joon Gu?

712
00:49:56,873 --> 00:49:59,707
Joon Gu?

713
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:02,024
Why? Did something happen?

714
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:05,044
No, I was just saying "What if"

715
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,873
What if that's the case.

716
00:50:07,873 --> 00:50:09,007
What if?

717
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:13,807
Yeah, what if that's the case.

718
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:16,607
Well, who knows?!

719
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:23,054
I didn't like him much because he was rough on the edges and all...

720
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:26,307
He's like a man.

721
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:30,173
And when he cooks, he really focuses.

722
00:50:30,173 --> 00:50:32,773
As a chef I think he's great.

723
00:50:32,773 --> 00:50:39,173
And more than anything else, he really likes you Ha Ni.

724
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:44,407
He cares for you, so there's nothing not to like.

725
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:49,373
Is that so?

726
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:56,007
I guess Seung Jo's getting married?

727
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:56,507
Yes.

728
00:50:56,507 --> 00:51:05,673
It's that girl who came to the restaurant?

729
00:51:05,673 --> 00:51:09,373
I feel like I've made an unwise decision.

730
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:15,907
We shouldn't have moved back in no matter how much they tried to convince me.

731
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,873
You know.

732
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:21,024
If we stay here longer, it will get strange.

733
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:28,073
It'll get uncomfortable between people. We won't even be able to talk.

734
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:37,073
Seung Jo...Well Oh Ha Ni was a really good lady.

735
00:51:37,073 --> 00:51:40,173
Making me really think about it,

736
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:46,873
it was a good opportunity.

737
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:54,107
Yeah.

738
00:51:54,107 --> 00:52:19,427
There are many stars, right?

739
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:23,823
Oh, Joon Gu!

740
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:25,882
At the restaurant?

741
00:52:25,882 --> 00:52:28,857
Why? Today is your day off, isn't it?

742
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:30,029
What are you doing on your day-off alone?

743
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:34,057
I'm making a new menu Can you come by after school?

744
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:38,039
If you say it tastes good, then I want to officially present it to the chef.

745
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:55,766
You have to come, okay?

746
00:52:55,766 --> 00:52:57,019
These little punks... What are you doing?!

747
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:58,957
Get up quickly! Move it!

748
00:52:58,957 --> 00:53:00,099
Sunbae, can we not rest for a while?

749
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:02,049
What did you do so that you can rest?

750
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:05,223
Training does not stop. Never stop!

751
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,623
It's supposed to rain tomorrow morning. Are we doing this tomorrow too?

752
00:53:07,623 --> 00:53:16,457
Huh?

753
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:17,714
You crazy jerk

754
00:53:17,714 --> 00:53:22,157
Why would it rain on a day like this?! I'll bet my life savings and my left hand that it doesn't rain!

755
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,823
Hurry and get up and stop with the nonsense.

756
00:53:23,823 --> 00:53:29,257
Hurry!

757
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,387
You're the same.

758
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:33,957
Aigoo! Hey!

759
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:36,257
Seung Jo! It's really been a long time!

760
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:40,223
I've heard about your father. Is he alright now?

761
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,857
Yes, he got through it.

762
00:53:41,857 --> 00:53:44,357
Oh! That's a relief!

763
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:48,957
What to do about this? Since you don't come, the girls don't come as well.

764
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:52,049
Look at this! It's full of men. Aigoo really.

765
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:55,223
You came well. Since you're here, let's play a game.

766
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:58,823
I came to clean out my locker today.

767
00:53:58,823 --> 00:54:00,523
I don't think I'll be able to come for a while.

768
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:08,222
Something must be wrong with you. What kind of freshman is that busy?

769
00:54:08,222 --> 00:54:09,623
I don't see the ball boy today.

770
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:11,957
Ball boy?

771
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,757
Ahhh. Ha Ni?

772
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:19,423
She's always skipping these days. She must be busy dating that guy who works in the cafeteria.

773
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:27,757
These little punks! What are you doing?! Move it!

774
00:54:27,757 --> 00:54:29,059
This is our school's tennis court.

775
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:33,099
Ah, the tennis court where Ha Ni suffered and got ignored a lot?

776
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:35,079
Yeah. This is the place.

777
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:38,341
-Woah.-It's good, huh?

778
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:41,657
Yeah pretty extreme.

779
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:44,823
Wow, oh. Practicing...

780
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:49,823
Oh! Baek Seung Jo!

781
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:51,957
Why are you here?

782
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:53,059
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

783
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:56,723
Ah.That's right.

784
00:54:56,723 --> 00:55:01,223
Anyway, we heard you're getting married.

785
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:09,557
With Yoon Hae Ra?

786
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:14,059
Today, isn't Ha Ni meeting up with Bong Joon Gu?

787
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:18,557
Yeah! Bong Joon Gu is making something really yummy for her.

788
00:55:18,557 --> 00:55:21,757
Bong Joon Gu is so great!

789
00:55:21,757 --> 00:55:31,083
I know! Who knew he'd even ask her to marry him?

790
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:34,029
Is she responding today?

791
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:40,123
Ah, that's right! That's why she dressed up so nicely.

792
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:44,029
Then won't Ha Ni be the first one to get married?

793
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:59,895
Ah I know!

794
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:04,028
So Pal Bok Noodles.

795
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:13,895
Eat more of this.

796
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:15,043
Ah, I'm full.

797
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:18,595
How can you be full already? I prepared a lot.

798
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:20,328
Next time.

799
00:56:20,328 --> 00:56:22,427
But these are really delicious.

800
00:56:22,427 --> 00:56:24,862
Be sure to tell Dad. It'll be a jackpot.

801
00:56:24,862 --> 00:56:26,262
Is that so?

802
00:56:26,262 --> 00:56:32,431
Drink this. It's plum juice. You'll digest nicely.

803
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,746
Joon Gu, you're really great.

804
00:56:34,746 --> 00:56:36,586
It seems like your cooking skills have gotten better than my dad's.

805
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:38,362
Aigoo what are you talking about?

806
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:41,162
I still have a long way to go to be like Chef.

807
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:45,606
But since you're complimenting me, I do feel good.

808
00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:49,828
My heart is beating.

809
00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:58,484
It's raining really hard.

810
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:00,828
Here...

811
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:02,028
Ha Ni...

812
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:03,225
Huh?

813
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:06,952
What I said last time...

814
00:57:06,952 --> 00:57:11,013
I didn't just say it.

815
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:15,999
Have you thought about it?

816
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,062
But... I...

817
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:19,228
A little more ti...

818
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,928
It still can't be?

819
00:57:21,928 --> 00:57:24,095
I'm talking about Seung Jo.

820
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:29,262
He even went on a marriage meeting. You can't get rid of your feelings yet?

821
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:31,849
No, more than that...

822
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,462
Ha Ni...

823
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:39,328
That cold and bad guy, what do you like so much about him?

824
00:57:39,328 --> 00:57:44,562
I told you last time. I'm a house.

825
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,328
Whenever you come, I'll be always there.

826
00:57:47,328 --> 00:57:50,428
But

827
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:53,728
if you let the house be empty for too long,

828
00:57:53,728 --> 00:57:56,262
you can't use it anymore.

829
00:57:56,262 --> 00:57:59,928
Joon Gu...

830
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:01,028
Are you okay?

831
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:04,262
Ha Ni, are you okay?

832
00:58:04,262 --> 00:58:08,628
Ha Ni, I really like you!

833
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:09,428
Joon Gu...

834
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:10,562
Ha Ni...

835
00:58:10,562 --> 00:58:11,395
Joon Gu, don't do this.

836
00:58:11,395 --> 00:58:16,395
Joon Gu!

837
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:20,028
Don't be like this.

838
00:58:20,028 --> 00:58:20,728
No, don't do it.

839
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:32,862
I told you not to do it! Joon Gu!

840
00:58:32,862 --> 00:58:34,862
I guess...

841
00:58:34,862 --> 00:58:37,728
that it can't be me.

842
00:58:37,728 --> 00:59:14,037
I'm sorry, Joon Gu.

843
00:59:14,037 --> 00:59:16,704
<i>I really am no good.

844
00:59:16,704 --> 00:59:19,293
<i>After making Joon Gu that hopeful,

845
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:22,448
<i>he only ended up getting hurt.

846
00:59:22,448 --> 00:59:41,837
<i>What is this? Did I make it so that if it's not Baek Seung Jo, it can't be anyone?

847
00:59:41,837 --> 00:59:46,837
-What are you doing here?-What do you mean? Isn't it obvious?

848
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:48,047
There's no chance that you'd take an umbrella with you.

849
00:59:48,047 --> 01:00:06,335
Then, were you waiting for me?

850
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:11,304
Are you coming from meeting that guy?

851
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:13,646
Which answer did you give him?

852
01:00:13,646 --> 01:00:15,077
Huh?

853
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:18,037
I heard he asked you to marry him.

854
01:00:18,037 --> 01:00:19,549
Why?

855
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,374
I can't do that?

856
01:00:21,374 --> 01:00:24,304
That's why I ask, which answer you gave him.

857
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:26,504
Whatever I said to him,

858
01:00:26,504 --> 01:00:30,604
it's none of your business.

859
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:35,204
That's right.

860
01:00:35,204 --> 01:00:37,075
I...

861
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:40,937
am going to move out.

862
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:44,504
I've talked with my father about it.

863
01:00:44,504 --> 01:00:52,004
I'm going to get in your way.

864
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:55,004
It's a relief that Joon Gu works so hard.

865
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:57,437
My dad likes him a lot too.

866
01:00:57,437 --> 01:01:05,007
Now, I should help my father at his restaurant with Joon Gu.

867
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:06,037
Do you like him?

868
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:09,443
Bong Joon Gu?

869
01:01:09,443 --> 01:01:12,017
Of course I do.

870
01:01:12,017 --> 01:01:14,037
For 4 years, he only liked me.

871
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,047
If someone says they like you, then you just like them like that too?

872
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:18,804
Why?

873
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:20,504
I can't do that?

874
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:24,508
I'm tired of having a crush now.

875
01:01:24,508 --> 01:01:28,007
I want to see a guy that likes me. I like Joon Gu.

876
01:01:28,007 --> 01:01:29,904
You ...

877
01:01:29,904 --> 01:01:35,047
You like me.

878
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:40,067
You can't like anyone but me.

879
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:42,704
What is this, that confidence?

880
01:01:42,704 --> 01:01:45,017
Am I not right?

881
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:47,027
Yes, you are right!

882
01:01:47,027 --> 01:01:49,637
I only like you.

883
01:01:49,637 --> 01:01:51,537
So what am I supposed to do?

884
01:01:51,537 --> 01:02:22,774
You don't ever see me. Someone like me...

885
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:29,041
Don't say that you like another guy.

886
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:31,244
That's the second one.

887
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:33,009
Second what?

888
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:36,107
Kiss.

889
01:02:36,107 --> 01:02:40,207
It's the third.

890
01:02:40,207 --> 01:02:43,541
It's fine.

891
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:47,507
you don't have to count those things.

892
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:59,272
Okay.

893
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:13,324

895

<i>Then what about Bong Joon Gu?

898
01:03:24,274 --> 01:03:29,441
<i>You're faster than I thought. I knew that someday you'd find your true feelings.

899
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:30,855
<i>But you're not having a hard time anymore?

900
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:32,841

901
01:03:32,841 --> 01:03:34,307

<i>Yoon Hae Ra, what's wrong with you?

903
01:03:40,407 --> 01:03:45,274
I wanted to call you "Father."

904
01:03:45,274 --> 01:03:48,541
I wanted to call you "Father-in-law."

905
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:52,707

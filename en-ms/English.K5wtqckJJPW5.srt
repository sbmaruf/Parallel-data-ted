1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So I want to talk today about money and happiness,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which are two things

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
either trying to earn them or trying to increase them.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we see it in religions and self-help books,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that money can't buy happiness.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
(Laughter)

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So that's wrong, and, in fact, if you think that,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you're actually just not spending it right.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
maybe if you spent it differently,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that might work a little bit better.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier,

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
let's think about the ways we usually spend it

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that don't, in fact, make us happier.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We had a little natural experiment.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
on what happens to people when they win the lottery.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This article's about how their lives get ruined.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So what happens when people win the lottery

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is, number one, they spend all the money and go into debt,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and number two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever met

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
find them and bug them for money.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And it ruins their social relationships, in fact.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So they have more debt and worse friendships

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
than they had before they won the lottery.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What was interesting about the article

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
was people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And instead of talking about

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness,

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
everyone instantly started saying,

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
"You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ?"

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and fantasizing about what they'd do.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
One person wrote in, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and have a little house on top."

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
(Laughter)

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with money

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and sipping a glass of champagne."

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is even worse now: "Then I'd have a picture taken

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and dozens of glossies made.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else."

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
(Laughter)

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And so many of the comments were exactly of this type,

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
where people got money

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and, in fact, it made them antisocial.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It also, money often makes us feel very selfish

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and we do things only for ourselves.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happy

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
is that we're always spending it on the wrong things,

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and in particular, that we're always spending it on ourselves.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And we thought, I wonder what would happen

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
if we made people spend more of their money on other people.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So instead of being antisocial with your money,

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
what if you were a little more prosocial with your money?

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So let's have some people do what they usually do

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and spend money on themselves,

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and let's make some people give money away,

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So the first way that we did this.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
at University of British Columbia

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They said, "Yes."

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And one of the envelopes had things in it that said,

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself."

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Other people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said,

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on somebody else."

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Also inside the envelope was money.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And we manipulated how much money we gave them.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We called them up at night and asked them,

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
"What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?"

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What did they spend it on?

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Well these are college undergrads, so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
were things like earrings and makeup.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
People gave money to homeless people.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Huge effect here of Starbucks.

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
(Laughter)

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to them

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But some people bought a coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So the very same purchase,

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
just targeted toward yourself

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
or targeted toward somebody else.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day?

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
People who spent money on other people got happier.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
People who spent money on themselves, nothing happened.

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
rather than on yourself.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We see this again and again

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Of course, these are undergraduates in Canada --

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
not the world's most representative population.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
or just among wealthy countries.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So imagine, instead of just people in Canada,

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we said, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Describe it. How happy did it make you?"

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Or in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
on yourself or other people and describe that."

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then we asked them how happy they are again.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And what we see is sort of amazing

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because there's human universals on what you do with your money

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then real cultural differences on what you do as well.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So for example,

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
one guy from Uganda says this.

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He said, "I called a girl I wished to love."

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They basically went out on a date,

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Here's a guy from Canada.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Very similar thing.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We went to a movie, we left early,

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake.

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Human universal -- so you spend money on other people,

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you're being nice to them.

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But then we see extraordinary differences.

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So look at these two.

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is a woman from Canada.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I drove to the mall in my car, bought a present, gave it to my mom."

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Perfectly nice thing to do.

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's good to get gifts for people that you know.

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Compare that to this woman from Uganda.

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
"I was walking and met a long-time friend

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
whose son was sick with malaria.

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So it's a very small amount of money, in fact.

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But enormously different motivations here.

155
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is a real medical need,

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
literally a life-saving donation.

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What we see again though

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is that the specific way that you spend on other people

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
isn't nearly as important

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
as the fact that you spend on other people

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
in order to make yourself happy,

163
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
which is really quite important.

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy.

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can do small, trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this.

166
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
These are only two countries.

167
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to see what the relationship is between money and happiness.

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We got data from the Gallup Organization,

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They ask people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?"

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And we can see what the relationship is between those two things.

174
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Are they positively correlated? Giving money makes you happy.

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Or are they negatively correlated?

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
On this map, green will mean they're positively correlated

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and red means they're negatively correlated.

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And you can see, the world is crazily green.

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So in almost every country in the world

180
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
where we have this data,

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
people who give money to charity are happier people

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
that people who don't give money to charity.

183
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle.

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
but in fact, it's Central African Republic.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can make up stories. Maybe it's different there for some reason or another.

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though,

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
which is amazingly green.

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So almost everywhere we look

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we see that giving money away makes you happier

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
than keeping it for yourself.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our time

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
when we're not with the people we know.

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So these are sales teams in Belgium.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They work in teams; they go out and sell to doctors

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and try to get them to buy drugs.

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So we can look and see how well they sell things

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
as a function of being a member of a team.

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Some teams, we give people on the team some money for themselves

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and say, "Spend it however you want on yourself,"

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
just like we did with the undergrads in Canada.

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.

204
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Spend it on one of your teammates this week.

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them.

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then we can see, well now we've got teams that spend on themselves

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and we've got these prosocial teams

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
who we give money to make the team a little bit better.

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there

210
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata,

211
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that.

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
A very silly, trivial thing to do,

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all,

214
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
maybe bought themselves a coffee,

216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
or teams that had this prosocial experience

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What we see is that, in fact, the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
than the teams that only got money for themselves.

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And one way to think about it

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
they put it in their pocket, they don't do anything different than they did before.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't get any money from that.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better.

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
they do so much better on their teams

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves,

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
this is all fine,

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and I can't imagine it would work there.

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here,

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't believe anything he said.

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
(Laughter)

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This was a huge criticism that we got

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to say, if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So we went out and found these dodgeball teams

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and infiltrated them.

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And we did the exact same thing as before.

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So some teams, we give people on the team money, they spend it on themselves.

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Other teams, we give them money

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to spend on their dodgeball teammates.

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The teams that spend money on themselves

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
are just the same winning percentages as they were before.

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The teams that we give the money to spend on each other,

247
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
they become different teams

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and, in fact, they dominate the league by the time they're done.

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Across all of these different contexts --

250
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
your personal life, you work life,

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
even silly things like intramural sports --

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
than spending on yourself.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And so I'll just say, I think if you think money can't buy happiness

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you're not spending it right.

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and that's the way to make yourself happier.

258
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's in fact, that you should stop thinking

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
about which product to buy for yourself

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and try giving some of it to other people instead.

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And we luckily have an opportunity for you.

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools.

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They post projects,

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
so they say, "I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class  and we don't have the books,"

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
or "I want a microscope to teach my students science

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and we don't have a microscope."

268
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You and I can go on and buy it for them.

269
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note.

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope.

271
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's an extraordinary thing.

272
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Go to the website and start yourself on the process

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
of thinking, again, less about "How can I spend money on myself?"

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars,

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
what can I do to benefit other people?"

276
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Because ultimately when you do that, you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more.

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank you.

278
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
(Applause)

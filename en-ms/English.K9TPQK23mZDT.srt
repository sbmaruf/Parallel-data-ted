1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,790
A recipe for oatmeal cookies
calls for 2 cups of flour

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,160
for every 3 cups of oatmeal.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,630
How much flour is
needed for a big batch

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,592
of cookies that uses
9 cups of oatmeal?

6
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,300
So let's think about
what they're saying.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,239
They're saying 2 cups of flour.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:25,345
So 2 cups of flour for
every 3 cups of oatmeal.

9
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:39,349

10
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:40,890
And so they're
saying, how much flour

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,570
is needed for a big
batch of cookies

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,700
that uses 9 cups of oatmeal?

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,200
Now we're going to
go to a situation

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,580
where we are using
9 cups of oatmeal.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,187
Let me write it this
way-- 9 cups of oatmeal.

16
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:58,020
And I'll show you a
couple of different ways

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,769
to think about it.

18
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:01,900
And whatever works
for you, that works.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,695
So one way to think about
it, so we're wondering.

20
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:06,070
We're going to
say, look, we know

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,130
if we have 3 cups of oatmeal,
we should use 2 cups of flour.

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,170
But what we don't know is if
we have 9 cups of oatmeal,

23
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,220
how many cups of
flour do we use?

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,812
That's what they're asking us.

25
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,520
But if we're going
from 3 cups of oatmeal

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,330
to 9 cups of oatmeal, how much
more oatmeal are we using?

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,530
Well, we're using three
times more oatmeal, Right?

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,934
We're multiplying by 3.

29
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:28,600
3 cups of oatmeal and
9 cups of oatmeal,

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,700
we're using 3 times the oatmeal.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,070
Well, if we want to use
flour in the same proportion,

32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,650
we have to use 3
times the flour.

33
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,190
So then we're also going to
multiply the flour times 3.

34
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,940
We're going to multiply
the flour times 3,

35
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,220
so we're going to have
to use 6 cups of flour.

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,920

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,050
Ignore that question mark.

38
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,160

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,550
And that answers the question.

40
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,110
That's how much flour we need
for a big batch of cookies

41
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,840
that uses 9 cups of oatmeal.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,040
The other thing is you
could set up a proportion.

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:15,300
You could say 2 cups of
flour over 3 cups of oatmeal

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,060
is equal to question mark.

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,610
And instead of
writing question mark,

46
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,030
I'll put a variable in there.

47
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,161

48
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,910
Actually, let me put
a question mark there

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,560
just so you really
understand it is

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,530
equal to a question
mark in a box number

51
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,615
cups of flour over
9 cups of oatmeal.

52
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:42,200

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,047
And so I like this
first way we did it

54
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,630
because it's really
just common sense.

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,370
If we're tripling the
oatmeal, then we're

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,440
going to have to
triple the flour

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,820
to make the recipe in
the same proportion.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,030
Another way, once you set
up an equation like this,

59
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,160
is actually to do a
little bit of algebra.

60
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,140
Some people might call
it cross-multiplying,

61
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,770
but that
cross-multiplying is still

62
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,420
using a little bit of algebra.

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,780
And I'll show you why they're
really the same thing.

64
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,300
In cross-multiplication,
whenever

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,160
you have a proportion
set up like this,

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,920
people will multiply
the diagonals.

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,030
So when you use
cross-multiplication,

68
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:21,020
you'll say that 2 times 9
must be equal to question mark

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:27,620
times 3, must be equal to
whatever is in this question

70
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,420
mark, the number of
cups of flour times 3.

71
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,750
Or we get 18 is
equal to whatever

72
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,380
our question mark was times 3.

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,640
So the number of cups of
flour we need to use times 3

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,170
needs to be equal to 18.

75
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,430
What times 3 is equal 18?

76
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,180
You might be able to
do that in your head.

77
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,030
That is 6.

78
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,400
Or you could divide both sides
by 3, and you will get 6.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,770
So we get question
mark in a box needs

80
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,070
to be equal to 6 cups of flour.

81
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,575
Same answer we got through
kind of common sense.

82
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,950
Now, you might be
wondering, hey,

83
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,530
this cross-multiplying doesn't
make any intuitive sense.

84
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,090
Why does that work?

85
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,510
If I have something set up
like this proportion set up,

86
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,490
why does it work that if I
take the denominator here

87
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,490
and multiply it by the
numerator there that that

88
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,906
needs to be equal
to the numerator

89
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,560
here times the
denominator there?

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
And that comes from
straight up algebra.

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,760
And to do that, I'm just going
to rewrite this part as x just

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,580
to simplify the
writing a little bit.

93
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,350
So we have 2/3 is equal to--
instead of that question mark,

94
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,110
I'll write x over 9.

95
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,830
And in algebra,
all you're saying

96
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,500
is that this
quantity over here is

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,850
equal to this
quantity over here.

98
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,840
So if you do anything
to what's on the left,

99
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,310
if you want it to
still be equal,

100
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,400
if the thing on the right
still needs to be equal,

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,470
you have to do the
same thing to it.

102
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,220
Now, what we want to do is we
want to simplify this so all

103
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,530
we have on the
right-hand side is an x.

104
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,309
So what can we
multiply this by so

105
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:53,600
that we're just left with an x?

106
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
So that we've solved for x?

107
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,550
Well, if we multiply
this times 9,

108
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,390
the 9's are going to cancel out.

109
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,970
So let's multiply
the right by 9.

110
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,844
But of course, if we
multiply the right by 9,

111
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,850
we have to still
multiply the left by 9.

112
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,740
Otherwise they still
wouldn't be equal.

113
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,470
If they were equal before
being multiplied by 9, for them

114
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,720
to still be equal, you have to
multiply 9 times both sides.

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,760
On the right-hand side,
the 9's cancel out,

116
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,330
so you're just left with an x.

117
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,490
On the left-hand side, you have
9 times 2/3, or 9/1 times 2/3.

118
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,770
Or this is equal to 18/3.

119
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,300
And we know that 18/3
is the same thing as 6.

120
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,440
So these are all
legitimate ways to do it.

121
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,340
I wanted you to understand
that what I'm doing right here

122
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,840
is algebra.

123
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,840
That's actually the reasoning
why cross-multiplication works.

124
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,950
But for a really simple
problem like this,

125
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,740
you could really just
use common sense.

126
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,520
If you're increasing the cups
of oatmeal by a factor of 3,

127
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,799
then increase the cups of
flour by a factor of 3.

128
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,299

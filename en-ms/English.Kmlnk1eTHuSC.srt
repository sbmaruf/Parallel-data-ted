1
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:59,024
A true gentleman would never leave such a beautiful lady by herself..

2
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:58,785


3
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:05,064
This is a dream, right? I feel like I'm floating.

4
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:24,623
It would be nice if she got off of my shoes...

5
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:27,581
She looks like a completely different person.

6
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,183
Definitely Min Seo Hyun's work.

7
00:02:30,183 --> 00:04:00,273
Maybe I should bring her to my next exhibition as my partner.

8
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,775
What the...

9
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:19,226
WAHHH!!!

10
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:30,469
Save me!!!

11
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:46,527
He fell! Senior Goo Joon Pyo fell into the pool!Come quickly!

12
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:49,657
What is it? Why is it such a big deal ?

13
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,757
He can't

14
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,725
Eh?

15
00:04:51,725 --> 00:05:06,165
The only thing the GREAT Goo Joon Pyo cannot do is swim!

16
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:49,061
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo! Wake up! Open your eyes!Ya!

17
00:05:49,061 --> 00:06:00,069
What the..

18
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:48,541
You're such scum.

19
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,058
You swindling bastard!

20
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:59,186
Achoo!!

21
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:04,657
Master, I'm sorry! I'll prepare the tea again! Please forgive me!

22
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,627
For what?

23
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,932
Have you caught a cold? Shall I call Doctor Kim?

24
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:20,273
What cold? I feel great. Prepare the car, I should go to school soon.

25
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,061
You want to leave this early sir?

26
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:32,884
It's never too early for a student going to school. Don't you know that bugs that wake up early die early?

27
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:35,721
I'll fire the maid immediately.

28
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,039
But why?

29
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:47,132
Pardon?

30
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:56,209
Butler Lee, don't you think you are too uptight? Relax. Relax.

31
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:38,522
Ahhh, what wonderful weather!

32
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:49,896
What the.. Goo Joon Pyo!

33
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:55,635
Wait until I get my hands on you! If you get caught, you're done for.

34
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,673
Getting here so early just to work on that.

35
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:04,176
This is the first time I've seen him try this hard.

36
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,949
Problem is, why must he torture the poor transfer student

37
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,485
Furthermore, if you think about it,isn't she the one who saved his life?

38
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,855
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.This is a situation you use it in, isn't that right?

39
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:18,764
What are you guys talking about? This is my way of saying thanks for yesterday.

40
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:23,697
If not, why would I bother to do suchsilly things to a low class person.

41
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,735
Normal people may not be grateful for this.

42
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,539
Ji Hoo isn't here. So now you arepicking on me instead, huh?

43
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,941
Right, why isn't that guy here, anyway?

44
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:37,578
After he came back from Hainan Island,he slipped into depression

45
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:42,249
Lovers quarrel huh?

46
00:09:42,249 --> 00:11:20,727
idiot! If you like a girl, just grab her. What's so hard about that?

47
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:33,739
I'll just leave after I do this...

48
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:39,747
First, it was Senior Joon Pyo and now, Senior Ji Hoo? Does she have a death wish or something?

49
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,183
Oh, my god! Look at that fox!

50
00:11:42,183 --> 00:12:45,112
Naturally, that girl is the type thatdoesn't know when to back off. What the heck are we supposed to do now?

51
00:12:45,112 --> 00:13:11,371
(Geum Jan Di's â™¥)

52
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:16,483
Hey! Don't you think you're arriving kind of late? Could you even be on a swim team? You'd be forced off for sure.

53
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:21,247
Could you even be on a swim team?

54
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:56,382
You'd be kicked out for sure..

55
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:59,134
I think they've been meeting up for a while.

56
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:03,524
There's a reason senior JiHoo is so protective of JanDi .

57
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:07,494
As time passes, friendships are even being affected because of this girl.

58
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:14,768
So now you know that even though JanDi looks innocent,her actions are those of a lovely snake.

59
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,738
Shut up!!

60
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:33,042
If you say one more word, I will twist your neck.

61
00:14:33,042 --> 00:15:32,107
That was brand new...

62
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:36,016
Disappointed the one you were really hoping to see isn't here?

63
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:38,352
Goo JoonPyo! Why are you . . .

64
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:42,693
What? Am I not allowed to come here?

65
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:50,329
Did you two rent this place out or something?

66
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,232
Where are you going?

67
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,734
Since I have nothing to say to you I'm going home. Do you have a problem with that?

68
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:54,769
I do

69
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:55,669
What the heck are you doing?!

70
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,157
I have something to say!

71
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,657
Let go.. and talk.

72
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:03,011
Who do you think you are to fool with me? To mess with us, the great F4 ?

73
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:06,279
Who fooled whom?

74
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,549
Let go!!

75
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:15,989
Was I a joke? Just 'cause i went easy on someone like you?

76
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:22,829
I don't know if you know this about me,but I'm not a charitable person.

77
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:31,737
It's dissatisfying having to give more than I can take.

78
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:38,779
What the heck are you doing?

79
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:59,533
No! Stop!No!

80
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:38,438
Do you hate me that much?

81
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:41,508
Geum Jan Di, are you going to school or not?

82
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:42,246
I'm not going!

83
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,744
Would you like to get hit and go? Or just go?

84
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:45,479
Just hit me and I won't go. Hit me!

85
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,915
Huh! You, really!

86
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,225
Would you like to get hit and go? Or just go? I want to get hit and not go. Hit me! I'm not going! I can't go!

87
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:52,319
I'd rather break the ice of the Han river and swim there.

88
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,154
I'm not going back that school! Never!

89
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:57,791
Do you want me to die? I'll never go back!

90
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:02,073
Isn't today PlaySat.(nol toh= short for "playing saturday")?

91
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:06,027
And also, some man delivered this for you.

92
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:08,703
What is that?

93
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:10,037
What's that?

94
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:12,607
Invitation. Hello. I want to invite all of you to my home to celebrate my 23rd birthday. Please free up your schedule so you can attend.. Min SeoHyun

95
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,041
Pa... Party!!

96
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:21,252
Party? Then, is our Jan Di finallymaking her debut in society?

97
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:25,622
Oh, honey! <BR>Honey, honey, honey...

98
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:28,154
Give me the card. Give it to me!

99
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:33,361
It's not time for us to be doing this right now.Dress, honey dress, dress

100
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,161
Dress!

101
00:18:34,161 --> 00:19:04,858
Take this one here.

102
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:12,002
I'm sorry, Jan Di. I can't even give my daughter a nice evening dress.

103
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:16,603
I'm sorry, JanDi. Since our neighborhood is poor, they don't bring in decent clothes to be serviced here either!

104
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:21,047
Ah! There's a hanbok. How this? Will it do?

105
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:24,011
Is she going to a traditional wedding?

106
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:27,079
They said garden party, PARTY!

107
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:34,002
Isn't this the part where the charming princecomes and takes the girl shopping for a dress?

108
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:39,046
Hello. This is a gift from Ms. Min Seo Hyun.

109
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:49,937
Min Seo Hyun?!

110
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:52,373
Let's see, let's see.

111
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,377
Does it fit?

112
00:19:53,377 --> 00:20:12,859
A little bit lower.

113
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:16,001
Why didn't you call last time?

114
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,098
You said you were going to call me, but you never did.

115
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:21,234
Wait a minute, you said the same thing to me too!

116
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,337
Who did you come with tonight?

117
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:25,046
I don't think you're with someone.What do you think about me??

118
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,675
What are you talking about? It's me that he wants!

119
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,711
Ya! Don't touch him. You're funny!

120
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:32,068
Hold on, hold on, sorry!

121
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:45,593
Hey, darling, why are you so late?

122
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:48,728
What brings you here?

123
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:51,000
Seo Hyun unnie invited me here, why?

124
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,435
Did you empty the departmental store ?

125
00:20:54,435 --> 00:21:00,007
I thought this last time too, but doesn't Geum Jan Dilook pretty good when she's all dressed up?

126
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:04,311
Right. You're the cutest one here.

127
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:11,317
Cute??! Can you transform a pumpkin into awatermelon just by drawing some lines on it?

128
00:21:11,317 --> 00:22:05,086
- Huh! Goo Joon Pyo- has a point.

129
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:39,654
Happy Birthday to you. Dear Min Seo Hyun~Happy Birthday to you~

130
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:44,993
Thank you all for coming here to celebrate my 23rd birthday

131
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:51,211
I would like to thank my family andfriends for their love and care.

132
00:22:51,211 --> 00:23:03,044
I also have something else to announce to all of you. That was why I held this huge party, which is not like me.

133
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:08,983
Where'd that punk Ji Hoo go? They're not gonna announce their engagement, are they?

134
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:13,387
I'm going back to Paris next week

135
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:18,029
And I won't be returning to Korea.

136
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,063
I've already packed and arrangedeverything and folded model activities.

137
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,831
What's she talking about?

138
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:37,945
I do not wish to rely on the fruits of my parents' labor. Instead, I would like to start fresh relying only on my own abilities.

139
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:42,816
I will not be taking over my parent's law firm.

140
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:54,029
Because I want a life where I cantravel the world and give back as much as I can.

141
00:23:54,029 --> 00:24:03,572
My decision is bound to cause an uproar since it will be hard for those of you with differing views to understand.

142
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:25,023
Everyone...please be happy for me.

143
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:29,363
Min SeoHyun, she's always full of surprises!

144
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:34,001
JiHoo... did he know about this the whole time?

145
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:37,072
Now we know the reason why he's been so depressed.

146
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:59,494
It's impressive, but, what's JiHoo gonna do?

147
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:05,002
Hi.

148
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:09,047
I can't believe you still have this.

149
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:15,976
It's from the first time we were separated.

150
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:20,047
You remember, huh?

151
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:26,321
It's since then that you stopped calling me noona.

152
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:34,629
What was I to you?

153
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:43,971
Our Ji Hoomust be very mad.

154
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:45,506
I also feel like I'm being thrown away.

155
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:53,347
If there is something here that can't be so easily thrown away...it's... you.

156
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:54,816
Don't lie!

157
00:25:54,816 --> 00:26:02,924
If it was a lie, then it wouldn't have botheredme that you're interested in someone else.

158
00:26:02,924 --> 00:26:03,925
What are you talking about?

159
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:10,765
When you dashed towards that girl,I don't know why but my heart sank.

160
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:13,835
Funny, right?

161
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:17,705
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

162
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:26,247
But isn't it great? Our JiHoo has really become a man.

163
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:32,072
Don't joke around!

164
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:35,356
You'll do what you want anyway.

165
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:41,529
But you'll tighten me today and loosen me up tomorrow so I can neither go to you nor distance myself from you. I was just a toy.

166
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:49,803
If I lost you I would not be able to sleep

167
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:51,839
Who's interested in whom?

168
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,242
Only looking at Min Seo Hyun for15 years, it's not enough!

169
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:56,987
I'm a man, too!

170
00:26:56,987 --> 00:27:10,824
A man who's eager to embrace awoman called Min Seo Hyun!

171
00:27:10,824 --> 00:28:14,955
I know, me too.Sorry, Ji Hoo.I'm really sorry.

172
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:18,297
It would be really embarrassing if you passed out there.

173
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:24,832
Such behavior really doesn't suit you.You know that, right?

174
00:28:24,832 --> 00:28:34,808
Who says I was going to faint?

175
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:40,147
Oh, JanDi, you came... but why didn't you come in?

176
00:28:40,147 --> 00:28:45,072
Ah... that... uh... that's because...

177
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:52,066
I was about to come to greet you andsay thank you. I came by... just NOW.

178
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,495
The party was chaotic, yes?

179
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:58,967
We were thinking of going on a quiet drive together.Would you like to come with us then?

180
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:05,473
Eh?Oh, no.. it's ok.

181
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:08,409
We have somewhere else to go.

182
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:09,109
We?

183
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:14,315
Yes both of us were also going to go for a drive.

184
00:29:14,315 --> 00:29:20,655
Drive! We're going to...Then, goodbye.

185
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:38,539
See you later.Let's go.- Unni-

186
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:40,007
I've paid my debt.

187
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:41,041
What debt?

188
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,071
Saving me at the pool.

189
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:47,815
You want to repay me for saving your life just like that?

190
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,082
Then shall we go back?

191
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,851
10%

192
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:53,254
let's say it's even..

193
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:54,655
50

194
00:29:54,655 --> 00:30:08,836
25

195
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:12,206
This is nice.

196
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:17,411
But why aren't there any customers?

197
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:19,038
I sent them out.

198
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,683
Why?

199
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:27,002
I rented it out til the morning,so do whatever you want.

200
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:29,519
Do whatever I want, what?

201
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:35,529
Yell or cry. If you want to hit someone, do youwant me to call a Mr. portly on standby outside?

202
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:41,034
Why do I have to do that?

203
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:46,072
DIdn't you have a heart attack afterseeing JiHoo and SeoHyun?

204
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:49,043
What? no way!

205
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:54,781
Someone like me can't compete with Min SeoHyun, right.?

206
00:30:54,781 --> 00:31:01,756
I'm not pretty, not smart either.And I come from a poor family.

207
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:06,826
And your figure is mediocre and your character sucks too.

208
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:14,738
THAT'S RIGHT! How could a girl like medare to be jealous of Min SeoHyun?

209
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:17,471
I didn't have a chance against her from the beginning.

210
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:27,848
Even though there's lots of bad things about you, there are still some good things.

211
00:31:27,848 --> 00:31:32,419
You have potential.

212
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,622
Huh?

213
00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:46,968
I'm certain if Ji Hoo had met you first, he would have fallen for you.

214
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:50,007
Seriously?

215
00:31:50,007 --> 00:32:00,781
Looks, brains, and background may not be much,but you're the first girl I've approved of.

216
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:12,081
Full of potential.

217
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:29,929
Hang on, I need to go use the restroom.

218
00:32:29,929 --> 00:33:05,663
It's warm. Isn't it warm? It's warm, I'm thirsty. Water.

219
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:18,478
Man, what the heck?

220
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:22,282
Hey, Dry Cleaner!

221
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:27,087
Hey, wake up!

222
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:28,721
What's wrong with her?

223
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:38,129
Well, it's because of that.

224
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,499
She drank all of it?

225
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:42,968
Yes.

226
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:49,541
Hey. Hey! Wake up, woman!

227
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:58,095
Woman? Yeah, I'm a woman. What? Can't commoners be women too?

228
00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:18,704
I know that my family background, my physical appearance and my brains are all crap. Even without you pointing that out, I feel it in my bones every day, you bastard!

229
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:20,739
What? Bastard?

230
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:39,023
No, no. I don't have time to waste on things like this. If you only knew how busy I am.

231
00:34:39,023 --> 00:35:08,082
I have to be a loser at an exclusive school where it's not fate, do part-time jobs because of a Dad who causes so much trouble. And for tuition, I have to swim so I can get a scholarship. I don't have time to butt into you princes' love lives!

232
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:25,238
You alcoholic Hey, gangster! Wake up! Ya!

233
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:35,045
I'm so sad lately. I'm a bit sad.

234
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:45,759
You bastard! Goo JoonPyo! You're the enemy!

235
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:51,164
Fine, I'll let this go because I feel like it. 50%!

236
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:58,405
I'm saying that I'll cut in half what you owe to your savior!!

237
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:04,031
Thank you Goo JoonPyo, for saving me today.

238
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:38,677
I don't really have anything I can do for you, instead, I will . . . .

239
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:54,056
Aisshh!

240
00:36:54,056 --> 00:37:11,243
"Charity Auction in aid of Namibian Refugees""

241
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:17,055
I just know this is a really expensive room just by smelling it.

242
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:28,158
You have a really good sense of smell. (geh koh: euphemism short for "you have a nose like a dog")

243
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:31,898
What happened? Why am I here?

244
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:37,027
You're here because I brought you here. That's what I'm saying! Why am I here and not my house!

245
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:49,649
You don't remember?

246
00:37:49,649 --> 00:38:04,364
This suit just came from Milan two days ago, and was designed by the famous designer, Yoshikuchi Kenzi, of Ermenegildo Zegna as one of his new works for this spring/summer collection.

247
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:05,198
The price is . . .

248
00:38:05,198 --> 00:38:14,106
Hey, stop. There's no reason to shock her.

249
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:19,478
I'm not exactly in the mood to listen to you brag about your clothes right now in this kind of situation!

250
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:21,018
That's what I wore yesterday.

251
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:25,151
What's that got to do with me?!

252
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:51,276
It was the first time I wore that suit, and my last, thanks to someone.

253
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:55,078
Do you remember now?

254
00:38:55,078 --> 00:39:00,453
Then, in that state, we needed to come to my house. Or should we have gone to yours?

255
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:01,082
Sorry.

256
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:14,065
I already notified your parents. According to the driver, they didn't seem that concerned.

257
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:20,094
I'll leave now. I'm sorry for all the trouble I may have caused you.

258
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:27,279
Just do what you normally do.

259
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,815
Young master.

260
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:29,916
What's the matter?

261
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,816
The lady of the house . . .

262
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,551
What about the witch?

263
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:35,622
She has arrived.

264
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:37,889
Already?

265
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:45,764
Why is she here already?

266
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:46,933
What about JoonPyo?

267
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:48,667
He is on the second floor.

268
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:52,805
I'm going to have him take part in the event, so put someone on him to make sure he doesn't run off somewhere.

269
00:39:52,805 --> 00:40:01,079
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:08,954
What?

271
00:40:08,954 --> 00:40:10,489
It's an emergency!

272
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:12,425
YJH: What? GJP: The witch showed up here.

273
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:16,395
JanDi is in my room right now, but I can't get her out!

274
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:19,198
Joonpyo, if you get caught, then . .

275
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:33,098
You're dead meat!

276
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:41,987
She finds an unfamiliar girl in her son's room, especially someone with Geum JanDi's profile.

277
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:43,288
I'm really curious.

278
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:49,595
I'll bet $1,000 that she'll send JoonPyo to Alaska tomorrow morning.

279
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:54,007
I'll bet $3,000 that she'll send him to Sejong Antarctic Research Center.<BR>

280
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:57,067
Rather than that, she'll probably hire an asassin first.

281
00:40:57,067 --> 00:41:04,609
What? Really? Is she really that scary?

282
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:09,015
Do you remember the day we ran away from 6th grade camp?

283
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:46,183
We almost died. How can I forget?

284
00:41:46,183 --> 00:42:31,496
Don't move!

285
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:33,065
Bonjour!

286
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:36,369
Noona!

287
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,072
Is this really So YiJong?

288
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:40,187
Can you really look this cool?

289
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:43,009
Noona is the very one whom people call a Korean Vivienne Westwood.

290
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:44,543
What is it? Hurry up and tell me,

291
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:45,378
Hm?

292
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:47,246
What is it you want?

293
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:52,025
After all, this is why I like noona so much.

294
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:52,087


295
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:57,107
A request to sponsor needy schoolchildren has come in from Seoul City..

296
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,508
Reject.

297
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:02,612
The Ministry of Education would like to conduct a special selection process for agriculture students at Shinhwa University from next year onwards....

298
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:06,316
Reject.

299
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:08,886
You've held up JoonPyo well, right?

300
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:52,762
Yes.

301
00:43:52,762 --> 00:44:05,407
Hello.

302
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:07,444
Who is she?

303
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,182
Ah! Hello.

304
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,982
She's my guest, so don't worry about it.

305
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:18,522
She's in my house, so she's my guest as well. Isn't that right, young lady?

306
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:21,826
She's a friend.

307
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,226
Friend?

308
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:31,767
Yes, she's our junior at our school. She's a cute sophomore, so we're specifically training her as the F4 mascot. Something like that..

309
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:35,171
Whose daughter are you?

00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:36,873
I'm the . .

311
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:40,408
What does your father do?

312
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:41,544
My father -

313
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:43,246
has a business.

314
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:48,317
Really? What kind?

315
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:57,026
He's in the clothing business. No, I mean, fashion business. It's actually pretty famous within the industry.

316
00:44:57,026 --> 00:45:02,398
That's interesting. So, do you have any interest in today's auction?

317
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:13,043
Yes, she has more than an interest. With the new dress from Bella, she's the darkhorse who will definitely raise a lot of donations tonight..

318
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,845
I guess your mother has a very discerning eye.

319
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:21,151
What does your mother do?

320
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:25,722
President, it's time for you to greet your guests.

321
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:29,157
Joon Pyo, come downstairs and take your place.

322
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:34,196
The rest of you, since it's for a good cause, do your part before you leave.

323
00:45:34,196 --> 00:45:49,511
Yes ma'm!

324
00:45:49,511 --> 00:45:55,551
Why did you lie? How are you going to fix this?

325
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:57,853
We should have told the truth.

326
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:02,958
Then, should we tell the truth that your dad owns a dry cleaner and your mom, a sauna?

327
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:07,763
If we did that, then no one knows what would've happened to not only you, but to your family as well.

328
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:15,706
It's not a joke when we say that you won't survive once you've been singled out.

329
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:25,058
So it's genetic, huh?

330
00:46:25,058 --> 00:46:42,898
Yes, this next auction item, once you see it, I bet your eyes will jump! It's coming out now, please look closely. It's Swimmer Pak Taehwan's goggles!

331
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:58,715

00:47:16,965 --> 00:47:25,506
$8,000. Ah, I see $8,000. Do I hear $8,500?

337
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:29,813
Yes, $8,500.

338
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:38,721
10,000$ just came in. Yes, $10,000! Just now, a 10,000$ bid has come through the phone.

339
00:47:38,721 --> 00:47:49,231
Are there no further bids? If there are none, we will go onto the count. One, Two, Three!

This next auction item. Please look carefully, it's coming out right now. It's the newest item from the young sculptor, So YiJung. It's a vase. We will start bidding at 5,000,000 won.

342
00:48:38,847 --> 00:48:44,853
The next auctioned item is the suit of Shinhwa Group's Mr. Goo JunPyo.

343
00:48:44,853 --> 00:48:48,892
The greatest aspect of the suit is that the person wearing it cannot tell whether he is wearing it or not,

344
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,086
We are starting at $10,000.

Yes we have $10,000! Do we have $15,000?

I can't! I can't!

Yes, the light yellow tint, and the lemon-like color will uplift the wearer's glamour..

The gold spangles and beads stress the luxury of the item.

We are starting the bid for this Bella Song dress at $10,000.

Yes, we have $10,000! Do we have higher bids? $15,000?

How is JoonPyo doing these days?

He has been very quiet.

He is even attending school well.

Now what?

Pak Tae Hwan's goggles! If you sell them, you can get at least $2,000!

$2,000?! $2,000 for goggles? Sell them! We have to sell them. Where can you find $2,000?

00:52:15,363 --> 00:52:21,437
No way!! It's worth so much more.

383
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:31,113
What I'm saying is, this is one of those things that you can't put a price on.

384
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:40,454
Sell it. $2,000 is $2,000. I would understand if it were just $20. What's wrong with you?

385

What? I said, THANK YOU!!

394
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:53,304
Just a plain "thank you" would've sufficed. For being a commoner, all you have is your big pride.

That's it. I take it back! What? I'm taking back the thank you!

What was I thinking? People don't change that easily. I'm leaving.

Hey, Jandi Baht (field of grass) What!

401
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:43,131
Dropping out of school? You're really not going to come back?

402
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:47,204
Most likely. When are you leaving?

403

Tomorrow. Ah. So soon?

404
00:57:55,041 --> 00:58:04,588
I still haven't been able to say thank you . . . I haven't even returned the favor.

405
00:58:04,588 --> 00:58:13,365
If you keep saying things like that then I'm going to be sad.

406
00:58:13,365 --> 00:59:09,025
I knew from the moment I saw you, that it was you whom JiHoo talked about with a smile on his face.

00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:22,703
Um.. Unni.

408

JanDi, What are you doing?

409
00:59:26,077 --> 00:59:40,184
I was a fan of yours way before I even met you. So, that's why I know better than anyone why you made this kind of decision.

410
00:59:40,184 --> 00:59:44,021
But...

411
00:59:44,021 --> 00:59:50,528
I'm begging you, please don't leave.

412
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:53,963
Please stand up.

413
00:59:53,963 --> 01:00:03,054
I know that I have no right to make this kind of request and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if I don't even try . . .

414
01:00:03,054 --> 01:00:12,539
Is it because of JiHoo?

415
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:18,154
I don't know anything about Senior JiHoo

416
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:34,972
But, I do know how much he cares about you.

417
01:00:34,972 --> 01:00:46,217
And for some reason, I can see the sad look in his eyes. But, there are times when he does smile.

418
01:00:46,217 --> 01:00:56,036
He smiles so warmly that whoever is watching him feels that warmth.

419
01:00:56,036 --> 01:01:16,001
The only person who can make him smile is you. If you leave like this, he may never smile again.

420
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:29,025
Please stand up.

421
01:01:29,025 --> 01:01:42,105
To me, when a person tries to decide what to do, it's similar to buying something in a foreign country.

422
01:01:42,105 --> 01:01:57,418
If you don't buy it at that very moment, then there's no second chance. I know very well how agonizing that regret is.

423
01:01:57,418 --> 01:02:06,996
JiHoo is an important person to me. And I also believe that I am to him as well.

424
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:14,772
That's why I don't believe that he would want me to regret my decision.

425
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:19,911
What do you think?

426
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:24,948
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

427
01:02:24,948 --> 01:02:33,424
No, I'm really happy you said those things.

428
01:02:33,424 --> 01:02:36,493

Oh, hang on.

431
01:02:47,904 --> 01:02:56,213
Are these . . . for me?As I told you, shoes are of the utmost importance.

432
01:02:56,213 --> 01:03:05,522
I'll pray that these shoes take you to great places without fail.

433
01:03:05,522 --> 01:03:09,525
I also have a request for you.

434
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:37,587
Please, make JiHoo . . . smile again.

435
01:03:37,587 --> 01:03:40,122
Who do you think you are?

436
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:43,593
Who are you to say those things thing!?

437
01:03:43,593 --> 01:03:47,121
Who asked you to make that kind of request?

438
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:51,467
No, not a request, to beg?

439
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:54,304
Don't you have any pride?

440
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:59,808
It's not because I don't have any pride.

441
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:07,551
It's because you're in such agony. Because you looked like you would die of sadness.

442
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:16,727
What's it to you?! It has nothing to do with you!

443
01:04:16,727 --> 99:59:59,999

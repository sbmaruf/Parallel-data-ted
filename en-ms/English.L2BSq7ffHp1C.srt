1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,580
In the last video we touched on
the three states of matter

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,990
that are really most familiar
to our everyday experience.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,410
The solid, the liquid,
and the gas.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,910
And I kind of hinted that there
is a fourth state, which

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,310
I don't cover, because it's
usually not the domain of an

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,560
introductory chemistry course.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,750
But a little bit of a discussion
ensued on the

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,340
message board for that video.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,910
So I thought I would at least
touch on that fourth stage.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,580
And that's plasma.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,970
I'll do it in a suitably
bright color.

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,040
Plasma.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,110
And people consider it a fourth
state because it has

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,480
some properties of gases.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,430
In some ways it's almost
a subset of gases.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,880
But it also has properties of
conductivity that you normally

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,350
wouldn't associate with a gas.

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,100
And just so you know, when you
first hear it you think, oh

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,990
that's a fairly exotic
thing, plasma.

21
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,450
And in the first video, I said
it's only something that

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,690
occurs at high temperatures,
which isn't

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,370
exactly 100% right.

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,120
It doesn't have to be at
high temperatures.

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,730
I really should have said
that under extenuating

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,670
circumstances where you
have a very strong

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,040
electromagnetic field.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,550
Or something has to happen to
essentially bump the the

29
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,580
electrons, or move the electrons
off of gases that

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,410
would've otherwise have
kept their electrons.

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,540
So it's kind of analogous to
what happens in metal.

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,170
When we talk about metal bonds,
we talk about this

33
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,470
notion of a sea of electrons.

34
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,150
Let's say if we talked
about iron.

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,130
What happens with most metals
is that they have so many

36
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,220
electrons, and they are so
willing to give them, that the

37
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,990
electrons just kind of float
outside of the atoms

38
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,250
themselves and create this kind
of big sea of electrons.

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,760
And then the atoms
themselves become

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,110
positively charged ions.

41
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,020
Because they essentially
donated some

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,870
electrons to the sea.

43
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,220
So they're attracted to the sea
and that's what makes them

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,480
malleable and even more
importantly what allows them

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,510
to conduct electricity.

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,300
But they're all really packed
closely together and it's a

47
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,710
very dense structure.

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,320
Plasma is a situation where if
you take gases, and remember,

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,640
in gases things are
pretty far apart.

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,700
So you take a bunch of
gases and they have

51
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,699
high kinetic energy.

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,340
Although, they don't have to be,
that could be under very

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,970
low pressure.

54
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,950
But they're moving around and
bumping into each other.

55
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,740
But they're not close
to each other.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,450
They don't have a fixed
structure with each other.

57
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,140
Or they're not rubbing against
each other like in

58
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,430
the case of a liquid.

59
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,160
But what happens in a plasma, or
one situation is, that you

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,770
apply such a strong
electromagnetic field that the

61
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,460
electrons want to
disassociate.

62
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,130
So let's say these
electrons start

63
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,220
bumping off of the plasma.

64
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,530
And so a solid has
its own shape.

65
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,300
A plasma will take the shape of
its container like a gas.

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,350
And sometimes it is described
as an ionized gas.

67
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,810
And it's described as
ionized because

68
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,850
electrons are bumped off.

69
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,320
And when the electrons are
bumped off, the otherwise

70
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,310
neutral atoms now have
positive charges.

71
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,830
And what this allows is,
essentially a conduction of

72
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,450
electricity.

73
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,960
Because now these electrons
are free to move.

74
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,460
You might say that sounds like
a bizarre state of matter,

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,550
where does it exist?

76
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,930
Well, probably closest to home,
it exists in lightning.

77
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,940

78
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,580
And that's worthy of
an entire video.

79
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,300
But the idea is that you start
having a huge potential

80
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,765
difference between the clouds
and the ground.

81
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:26,150

82
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,480
And then because you have this
huge voltage difference

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,710
between the two, you have
electrons that are essentially

84
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,090
wanting to go into the ground.

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:42,400
You have a build-up of electrons
up here that want to

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,270
go into the ground.

87
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,870
They can't because
air is normally

88
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,390
a fairly bad conductor.

89
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,250
It's an insulator.

90
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,490
But what happens is because
there's so much

91
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,540
electropotential here, the
electrons that are close in

92
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,100
the molecules up here, at least
how I visualize it,

93
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,890
their electrons want to escape
from these clouds.

94
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,980
So their electrons start
to want to move

95
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,300
away in the air molecules.

96
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,130
Whether you're talking about
the air is a mixture of

97
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,750
oxygen, and nitrogen,
and carbon dioxide.

98
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,780
They start wanting to get
away from the clouds.

99
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,079
So they start disassociating
and start forming

100
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,950
this ionized air.

101
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,520
And eventually, at some point,
this happens to such a degree

102
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,210
that you can actually get
conduction from the cloud to

103
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,610
the ground.

104
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,850
And that conduction is when the
air is in a plasma state.

105
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,550
The conduction allows extremely
high temperatures

106
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,620
and the electrons to flow all
the way to the ground.

107
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,750
The other common example, you
might see something like this,

108
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,410
well actually not like this, but
at least a plasma state,

109
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,360
is in stars.

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,390
And that's because you
have extremely strong

111
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,400
electromagnetic fields,
extremely high pressure, and

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,480
in that type of environment,
once again, I'm old super over

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,870
simplifying it, you can get to
a state where the electrons

114
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,580
can get disassociated from
things that otherwise wouldn't

115
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,620
want to give up their
electrons.

116
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,410
I thought I would touch on
that because it's an

117
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,470
interesting subject.

118
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,820
And it exists in the universe.

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,760
On the universal level, because
stars are pretty much

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,295
all plasma, it is actually the
most common state of matter in

121
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,000
the universe.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,410
Although in our everyday life,
we probably encounter solids,

123
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,420
liquids and gases a lot more.

124
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,590
And one other thing I want to
maybe clarify from the last

125
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,300
video is, I talk about
the bonding

126
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,350
between water molecules.

127
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,180
And let's say we're talking
in the solid state.

128
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,660
So I have an oxygen, a
hydrogen, a hydrogen.

129
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,720
And I have some electrons here,
some electrons here.

130
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,866
Let's say there's another
hydrogen here, an oxygen, and

131
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,070
a hydrogen.

132
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,840
Maybe there's an oxygen here.

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,125
That has hydrogen.

134
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:58,710

135
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,130
And then this has a hydrogen.

136
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,370
And it has two electrons,
two electron pairs.

137
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,140
So I talked about the notion,
and we talked about it many

138
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,620
times before.

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,140
That oxygen is so much more
electronegative that it hogs

140
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,350
the electrons.

141
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,100
And so the oxygen side
starts to have a

142
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,060
partial negative charge.

143
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,900
While the hydrogen side
starts to have a

144
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,950
partial positive side.

145
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,420
Because with the hydrogen,
essentially all of its

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,730
electrons are hanging out close
to the oxygen, hydrogen

147
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,590
ends up just becoming like
this proton that's

148
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,130
floating out there.

149
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,310
Because we said it
doesn't even have

150
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,180
neutrons in most cases.

151
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,620
So this has a slightly
positive charge.

152
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,400
This one has a positive
charge.

153
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,560
And the positive polar end
of the water molecule is

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,290
attracted to the negative
polar end.

155
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,730
And I called it polar bonds,
and it shows you my memory

156
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,745
from high school chemistry is
not ideal, I really should

157
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:52,280
have called it hydrogen bonds.

158
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,010
So this is a hydrogen bond, and
this is a hydrogen bond.

159
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,810
It's just a matter of
the name I used.

160
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,780
I just want to clarify that
because that is what's

161
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,480
typically used in your
chemistry class.

162
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,620
I don't want to confuse you.

163
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,680
And that is just the bond that
exists from a partially

164
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,530
positive hydrogen atom.

165
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,400
Because its electrons are
hanging out near the oxygen.

166
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,980
And a partially negative
oxygen atom

167
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,200
in the water molecule.

168
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,920
Because it has stolen
all of these

169
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,580
electrons from the hydrogen.

170
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,680
You draw it like that, it's
called a hydrogen bond.

171
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,960
And hydrogen bonds tend to
form between hydrogen or

172
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,740
really only a handful of super
electronegative atoms. And

173
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,500
that's nitrogen, fluorine,
and oxygen.

174
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,230
And these are actually the three
most electronegative

175
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:54,680
atoms. So the nitrogen, NH3,
when it bonds with hydrogen,

176
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,940
is essentially so
electronegative that you have

177
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,210
the same situation.

178
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,410
All the electrons hang out here,
so you have a partial

179
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,770
negative charge, partial
positive on the hydrogen ends.

180
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,840
Same thing with hydrogen
fluorine.

181
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,410
You get the same HF.

182
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,740
You get the same type
of hydrogen bonds.

183
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,280
And so in this case, these guys
would be attracted to the

184
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,190
nitrogen part of other molecules
and would form

185
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,820
hydrogen bonds.

186
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,340
I just want to get that
out of the way.

187
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,720
And with that done, I think we
can return to some of the

188
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:31,200
ideas of the last video and
actually do some problems.

189
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,450
Let's take the case
with water.

190
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,950

191
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,780
Actually, let me just state the
problem first. So let's

192
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,600
say that we have a

193
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,803

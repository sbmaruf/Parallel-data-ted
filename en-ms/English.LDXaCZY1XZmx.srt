1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When you're searching for the light

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And you see no hope in sight

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Be sure and have no doubt

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He's always close to you

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He's the one who knows you best

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He knows what's in your heart

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You'll find your peace at last

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you just have faith in Him

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
(Allah) You're always in my heart and mind

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Your name is mentioned every day

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll follow you no matter what

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My biggest wish is to see you one day

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Coz I believe... I believe... I believe

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you believe, oh do you believe?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Coz I believe

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In a man who used to be

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So full of love and harmony

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He fought for peace and liberty

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And never would he hurt anything

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He was a mercy for mankind

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
A teacher till the end of time

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No creature could be compared with him

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So full of light and blessings (Muhammad)

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're always in my heart and mind

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Your name is mentioned every day

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll follow you no matter what

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If God wills we'll meet one day

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Coz I believe... I believe... I believe

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Do you believe, oh do you believe?

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you lose your way

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Believe in a better day

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Trials will come

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But surely they will fade away

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you just believe

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What is plain to see

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just open your heart

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And let His love flow through

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I believe I believe, I believe I believe

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And now I feel my heart is at peace

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I believe... I believe... I believe

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Do you believe, oh do you believe?

42
00:03:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I believe I believe, I believe I believe

How a Smartphone Knows Up From Down EngineerGuy Series #4 ﻿

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I think this is one of the coolest features of today’s smartphones.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It knows up from down.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Build into the circuitry is a tiny device that can

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
detect changes in orientation and tell the screen to rotate.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let me show you what it looks like in an old iPhone.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There it is

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It’s an accelerometer.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I’ll tell you how this kind of chip works and how its made

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but first, some basics of accelerometers.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They have two fundamental parts

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A housing attached to the object whose acceleration we want to measure

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and a mass that, while tethered to the housing, can still move.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here its a spring with a heavy metal ball.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you move the housing up the ball lags behind

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
stretching the spring.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If we measure how much that spring stretches

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we can calculate the force of gravity.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can easily see that three of these could determine

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the orientation of a 3-dimensional object.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
While lying with the z-axis perpendicular to gravity only

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the ball on the x-axis spring shows extension.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Turn this on it side so that z-axis point up and only

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the accelerometer along the spring on that axis stretches.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, how does this phone and this chip measure changes in gravity.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
While more complex than the simple ball and spring model

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
it has the same fundamental elements.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Inside the chip engineers have created a tiny accelerometer out of silicon.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It has, of course, a housing that’s fixed to the phone

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and a “comb-like” section can move back and forth.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That’s the seismic mass equivalent to the ball.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The spring in this case is the flexibility of the

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
thin silicon tethering it to the housing.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Clearly if we can measure the motion of this central section

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we can detect changes in orientation.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
To see how that’s done examine three of the fingers on the accelerometer.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The three fingers make up a differential capacitor.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That means that if the center section moves than current will flow.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Engineers correlate the amount of flowing current to acceleration.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This accelerometer fascinates me

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
but even more amazing is how they make such a thing.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It would seem nearly impossible to make such an intricate device

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
as the tiny smartphone accelerometer.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
At only 500 microns across no tiny tools could craft such a thing.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Instead, engineers use some unique chemical properties of

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
silicon to etch the accelerometer's fingers and H-shaped section.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
To get an idea of how they do this

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
let me show you how to make a single cantilevered beam

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
like a diving board

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in a solid chunk of silicon.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Empirically, engineers noticed that if they pour potassium hydroxide

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
on a particular surface of crystalline silicon

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
it would eat away at the silicon until it forms a pyramidal-shaped hole.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This occurs because of the unique crystal structure of silicon.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
To make a pyramidal hole in silicon engineers cover all but

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
a small square with a mask impervious to the KOH.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, it only etches within the square shape cordoned off by the mask.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The KOH dissolves silicon faster in the vertical

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
than in the horizontal direction.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This why it makes a pyramidal hole.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now, to make a cantilevered beam engineers follow these steps.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First, mask the surface except for a u-shaped section.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
At first the KOH will cut two inverse pyramids side-by-side.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As the etching continues the KOH begins to dissolve

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the silicon between these holes.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If we wash it away at just the right point

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
before it dissolves the silicon just underneath the mask

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
it will leave a small cantilever beam hanging over a hole with a square bottom.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Engineers make smartphone accelerometer using these same methods

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but as you can picture it takes a series of detailed masks

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to create the intricate structure of a smartphone accelerometer.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
While complex, a key point is that the whole process can be automated.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is absolutely essential in the miniaturization of technology

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
engineers now make all sorts of amazing things at this tiny scale

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
microengines with gears that rotate 300,000 times a minute

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
nozzles in ink-jet printers, and my favorite

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
micromirrors that focus light in semiconductor lasers.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000

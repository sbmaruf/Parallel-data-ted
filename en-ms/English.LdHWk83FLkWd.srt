1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a work in process,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
based on some comments that were made

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
at TED two years ago

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
about the need for the storage of vaccine.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(Music)

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
(Video) Narrator: On this planet,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
1.6 billion people

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
don't have access to electricity,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
refrigeration

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or stored fuels.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a problem.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It impacts:

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the spread of disease,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the storage of food and medicine

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the quality of life.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So here's the plan: inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
propane, gas, kerosene or consumables.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Time for some thermodynamics.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
who talked about absorption and refrigeration.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's one of those things that stuck in my head.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It was a lot like the Stirling engine:

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And it was invented in 1858, by this guy Ferdinand Carre,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but he couldn't actually build anything with it

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
because of the tools of the time.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928,

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and it was a really neat idea,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and I'll get to why it didn't work,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but here's how it works.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There's two spheres and they're separated in distance.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One has a working fluid, water and ammonia,

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and the other is a condenser.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You heat up one side, the hot side.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The ammonia evaporates

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and it re-condenses in the other side.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You let it cool to room temperature,

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then, as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
back on the erstwhile hot side,

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
it creates a powerful cooling effect.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if you heated them wrong.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It topped 400 psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it was kind of an interesting thought.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, the great thing about 2006 is

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
there's a lot of really great computational work you can do.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So, we got the whole thermodynamics department

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
at Stanford involved --

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
a lot of computational fluid dynamics.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We found some non-toxic refrigerants

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that worked at very low vapor pressures.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brought in a team from the U.K. --

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
there's a lot of great refrigeration people,

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
it turned out, in the U.K. --

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact,

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we could make a low pressure, non-toxic refrigerator.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, this is the way it works.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You put it on a cooking fire.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Most people have cooking fires in the world,

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
whether it's camel dung or wood.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Put it into a container

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It looks like this. This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons,

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and it'll cool it down to just above freezing --

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
three degrees above freezing --

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment. It's really cheap.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars,

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in low volumes for about 40 dollars.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And we think we can make refrigeration

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
something that everybody can have.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000

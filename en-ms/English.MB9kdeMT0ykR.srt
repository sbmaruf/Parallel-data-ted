1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,420
Simplify negative 1
times this expression

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,290
in brackets, negative 7 plus
2 times 3 plus 2 minus 5,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,140
in parentheses, squared.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,920
So this is an order
of operations problem.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,750
And remember, order
of operations,

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,280
you always want to
do parentheses first.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,230
Parentheses first.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,870
Then you do exponents.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,540
Exponents.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,940
And there is an exponent in
this problem right over here.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,290
Then you want to
do multiplication.

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,560
Multiplication and division.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,790
And then finally, you do
addition and subtraction.

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,380
So let's just try to
tackle this as best we can.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,900
So first, let's do
the parentheses.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,780
We have a 3 plus 2
here in parentheses,

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,156
so we can evaluate
that to be equal to 5.

19
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:53,780
And let's see, we
could do other things

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,363
in other parts of
this expression that

21
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:58,190
won't affect what's going on
right here in the parentheses.

22
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,280
We have this negative 5 squared.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,310
Or I should just, we're
subtracting a 5 squared.

24
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,050
We want to do the
exponent before we

25
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,390
worry about it being subtracted.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,380
So this 5 squared over
here we can rewrite as 25.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,600
And so let's not do
too many steps at once.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,970
So this whole thing will
simplify to negative 1.

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,070
And then in brackets, we have
negative 7 plus 2 times 5.

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,000

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,530
And then, 2 times 5.

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,280
And then close brackets.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,285
Minus 25.

34
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:35,490

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,869
Now, this thing-- we want
to do multiplication.

36
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:39,910
You could say, hey, wait.

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,940
I still have a parentheses here.

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,990
Why don't I do that first?

39
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,220
But when you just
evaluate what's

40
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,360
inside of this parentheses,
you just get a negative 7.

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,776
It doesn't really
change anything.

42
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:49,847
So we can just leave this
here as a negative 7.

43
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:50,680
And this expression.

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,220
We do want to evaluate this
whole expression before we

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,930
do anything else.

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,429
I mean, we could distribute
this negative 1 and all of that,

47
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,480
but let's just do straight
up order of operations here.

48
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,230
So let's evaluate
this expression.

49
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,950
We want to do multiplication
before we add anything.

50
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,520
So we get 2 times
5 right over there.

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,239
2 times 5 is 10.

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,090
That is 10.

53
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,465
So our whole
expression becomes--

54
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,840
and normally, you wouldn't
have to rewrite the expression

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,590
this many times.

56
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,006
But we're going
to do it this time

57
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:17,750
just to make sure no
one gets confused.

58
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,670
So it becomes negative 1
times negative 7 plus 10.

59
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,650
Plus 10.

60
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,660
And we close our brackets.

61
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,020
Minus 25.

62
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,110
Now, we can evaluate
this pretty easily.

63
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,980
Negative 7 plus 10.

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,190
We're starting at negative 7.

65
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,430
So I was going to draw
a number line there.

66
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,710
So we're starting-- let
me draw a number line.

67
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,640
So we're starting at negative 7.

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,610
So the length of this
line is negative 7.

69
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,650
And then, we're adding 10 to it.

70
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,136
We're adding 10 to it.

71
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,760
So we're going to
move 10 to the right.

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,180
If we move 7 to the
right, we get back to 0.

73
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,800
And then we're going to
go another 3 after that.

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,820
So we're going to
go 7, 8, 9, 10.

75
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,590
So that gets us to positive 3.

76
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,250
Another way to
think about it is we

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,590
are adding integers
of different signs.

78
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,500
We can view the
sum as going to be

79
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,490
the difference of the integers.

80
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,710
And since the larger
integer is positive,

81
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,470
our answer will be positive.

82
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,940
So you could literally just
view this as 10 minus 7.

83
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,100
10 minus 7 is 3.

84
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,590
So this becomes a 3.

85
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,990
And so our entire expression
becomes negative 1.

86
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,960
Negative 1 times.

87
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,880
And just to be clear,
brackets and parentheses

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,130
are really the same thing.

89
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,804
Sometimes people
will write brackets

90
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,470
around a lot of
parentheses just to make

91
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,900
it a little bit easier to read.

92
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,150
But they're really just the
same thing as parentheses.

93
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,620
So these brackets out here,
I could just literally

94
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,230
write them like that.

95
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,244
And then I have a
minus 25 out over here.

96
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,660
Now, once again, you want to
do multiplication or division

97
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,350
before we do addition
and subtraction.

98
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,260
So let's multiply the negative
1 times 3 is negative 3.

99
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,100
And now we need to
subtract our 25.

100
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,880
So negative 3 minus 25.

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,079
We are adding two
integers of the same sign.

102
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,620
We're already at
negative 3 and we're

103
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,980
going to become 25 more
negative than that.

104
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,390
So you can view
this as we're moving

105
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,270
25 more in the
negative direction.

106
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,515
Or you could view it
as 3 plus 25 is 28.

107
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,390
But we're doing it in
the negative direction,

108
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,480
so it's negative 28.

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,460
So this is equal to negative 28.

110
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,650
And we are done.

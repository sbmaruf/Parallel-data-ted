1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560


2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,150
We're asked to compute 4,800,
or four thousand eight

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,720
hundred, divided by 80, and then
they want us to check our

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,780
answer, or they say
check your answer.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,480
So I'll first do it just the
traditional long division way,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,500
and then we'll think about if
there's maybe a faster way to

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,920
do this or if we can even
do it in our heads.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,380
So let's just do it the
traditional way first. So we

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:28,460
have 80 and we want to
divide it into 4,800.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,980
Four thousand eight hundred.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,100
Or if we want to know the
terminology, 80 is the

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,480
divisor, 4,800 is the dividend,
and in the number

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,230
that we get, the number of times
80 goes into 4,800, we

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,990
could call that the quotient.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,230
I always get confused when I
start using words like that,

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,430
so we just think of it as 80 is
being divided into 4,800.

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,840
Now, the first thing we say:
Well, does 80 go into 4?

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,500
No.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,320
Does 80 go into 48?

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,710
No, it's bigger than 48.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,040
Does 80 going into 480?

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,260
Well, that looks interesting.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,310
Let's see, 6 times 8 is 48,
so 6 times 80 is 480.

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,315
We could do that right here.

25
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:16,180
80 times 6.

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,000
6 times 0 is 0.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,150
6 times 8 is 48.

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,800
Or another way you could have
thought about it is 6 times 8

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,470
is 48, and we have this
extra 0 here, so you

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,910
add the 0 right there.

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:33,020
So 80 goes into 480 six times,
because we're only

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,820
considering the 480.

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,980
We put the 6 right in 480's one
spot, which is really the

34
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,750
tens place, but if you just
think about the 480, it's

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,360
right above the zero.

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,520
Now 6 times 80 is-- we already
saw-- 480, and then we can

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,830
subtract, and we get the
zero, and we bring

38
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,090
down another zero.

39
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,710
80 goes into 0 how many times?

40
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,530
Well, it goes into
it zero times.

41
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,140
0 times 80 is 0.

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,960
You subtract.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,710
You get zeroes, and there's
nothing left to bring down, so

44
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,630
we're done.

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,100
4,800 divided by 80 is 60.

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,930
When the dividend is 4,800,
the divisor-- let me write

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,660
these words down.

48
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,090
This is divisor.

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,020


50
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,270
This is dividend.

51
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,320


52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,200
Then our quotient is 60.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,690
Now they want us to check our
answer, so we just have to

54
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,520
confirm that 60 times 80 is
4,800 so let's do that.

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,960
60 times 80-- now there's
two ways you can do it.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,190
You could just literally say 6
times 8 is 48, and then it'll

57
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,320
have two zeroes here,
one, two.

58
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,900
That's 4,800.

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,120
Or we could do it by hand.

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,090
0 times 0 is 0.

61
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,320
0 times 6 is 0.

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,220
Then we'll put a zero
here because we're

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,340
now in the tens spot.

64
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,320
Put the zero here.

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,820
8 times 0 is 0.

66
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,130
8 times 6 is 48.

67
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,200
Add all of this up.

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,570
You get 4,800, so it works.

69
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,170
A faster way would just have
been to say 8 times 6 is 48,

70
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,640
and you have one, two zeroes
here, so one, two

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,430
zeroes right there.

72
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,720
Now, a quick way to think about
4,800 divided by 80 is

73
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,050
to divide both of these numbers
by 10 first. And just

74
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,090
to think about it this way, what
we're doing, this could

75
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,230
be written as 4,800/80.

76
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,220
Or this could be written as--
let me write it down here.

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:52,130
4,800/80 could be written as 480
times 10 over 8 times 10.

78
00:03:52,130 --> 00:04:00,500
4,800 is just 480 times 10,
and 80 is just 8 times 10.

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,890
Now what happens here?

80
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:13,940
We could view this as being
equal to 480/8 times this 10

81
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,769
up here divided by this 10.

82
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,200
Now, what's 10 divided by 10?

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,829
What's any non-zero number
divided by itself?

84
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,420
Well, this is just
going to be 1.

85
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,900
10 goes into 10 one time,
so we're just left

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,670
with 480 over 8.

87
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,940
So essentially, you can
just knock off.

88
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,570
You can knock off the same
number of zeroes off of the

89
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,620
divisor as the dividend.

90
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,310
So we knock off one zero here,
one zero there, it becomes 480

91
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,960
divided by 8, and that's
an easier problem.

92
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,000
8 goes into 480, and you say 8
goes into-- it doesn't go into

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,440
4, so it goes into
48 six times.

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,590
6 times 8 is 48.

95
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,920
You have no remainder.

96
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,260
Bring down this zero.

97
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,770
8 goes into 0 zero times.

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,190
0 times 8 is 0.

99
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,710
No remainder.

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,230
And we get 60 again, so either
way would have worked.

101
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,950
This way is a little
bit faster.

102
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,960
You might be able to do it in
your head, but no matter which

103
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,690
way you do it, you get 60 as our
answer, and we confirmed

104
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,390
that it really works.

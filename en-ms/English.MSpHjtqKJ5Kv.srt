00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Every day throw away millions of electronic devices, because they get old and are worn out.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But usually it is only one of the components that causes the problem.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The rest of the device works fine, but is needesly thrown away.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Simply because electronic devices are not designed to last.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This makes electronic waste one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And our phone is one of the bigest causes.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So this is a new kind of phone.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's made of blocks.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Detachable blocks.

10
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,005
They are all connected to the base.

11
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,998
And the base connects everything together.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Electrical signals are transferred through the pins.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,870
And two small screws lock everything in place.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if for instance your phone is getting a litte slow, you can just upgrade the block that affects the speed.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or if something breaks you can easily replace it with a new one.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Or update it with the latest version.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
An other great thing about this is, you can customise your phone

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud. Why not replace your storage blok for a bigger battery blok?

19
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:23,005
If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Or if you don't care about about anything of this stuff, you can keep it simple. Get a bigger speaker.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can choose the Bloks that you want.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Support the brands you like.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Or even development your own Bloks!

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Phonebloks is build on an open platform.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Where companies work together to create the best phone in the world.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
To setup this platform we need to get the right people and companies involved.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It will only get started if there is enough interest in a phone that is worth keeping.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So this is the plan.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
To show them that there is interest in this phone, we need your voice.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You can donate your social reach on our website.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,570
We will gather as much people as possible.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
On the 29th of October we will send out a blast.

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
All at the same time.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Spreading all your voices to show the world there is a need for a phone worth keeping.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The more people involved, the bigger the impact.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000

1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,920
Determine whether 380 is
divisible by 2, 3,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,210
4, 5, 6, 9 or 10.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,010
They skipped 7 and 8
so we don't have

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,460
to worry about those.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,000
So let's think about 2.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,524
So are we divisible by 2?

7
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:20,220
Let me write the 2 here.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,880
Well, in order for something to
be divisible by 2, it has

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,160
to be an even number, and to be
an even number, your ones

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,560
digit-- so let me rewrite 380.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,450
To be even, your ones digit
has to be even, so

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,780
this has to be even.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,270
And for this to be even, it has
to be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, and

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,970
this is 0, so 380 is even, which
means it is divisible by

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,360
2, so it works with 2.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,710
So 2 works out.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,530
Let's think about the
situation for 3.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,130
Now, a quick way to think about
3-- so let me write just

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,010
3 question mark-- is to add
the digits of your number.

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,890
And if the sum that you get is
divisible by 3, then you are

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,980
divisible by 3.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,110
So let's try to do that.

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,900
So 380, let's add the digits.

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,290
3 plus 8 plus 0 is equal to--
3 plus 8 is 11 plus 0,

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,770
so it's just 11.

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,150
And if you have trouble figuring
out whether this is

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,420
divisible by 3, you could then
just add these two numbers

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,240
again, so you can actually add
the 1 plus 1 again, and you

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,480
would get a 2.

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,100
Regardless of whether you look
at the 1 or the 2, neither of

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,730
these are divisible by 3.

32
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:45,700
So not divisible by 3, and maybe
in a future video, I'll

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,860
explain why this works, and
maybe you want to think about

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,590
why this works.

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,710
So these aren't divisible by
3, so 380 is not divisible.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:05,560
380, not divisible by 3,
so 3 does not work.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,100
We are not divisible by 3.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,880
Now, I'll think about the
situation for 4, so we're

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
thinking about 4 divisibility.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,200
So let me write it in orange.

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,430
So we are wondering about 4.

42
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,930
Now, something you may or may
not already realize is that

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,310
100 is divisible by 4.

44
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,580
It goes evenly.

45
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,130
So this is 380.

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,940
So the 300 is divisible by 4, so
we just have to figure out

47
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,030
whether the leftover, whether
the 80, is divisible by 4.

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:46,050
Another way to think about it
is are the last two digits

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,220
divisible by 4?

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,410
And this comes from the fact
that 100 is divisible by 4, so

51
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,870
everything, the hundreds place
or above, it's going to be

52
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,450
divisible by 4.

53
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,760
You just have to worry
about the last part.

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,230
So in this situation, is
80 divisible by 4?

55
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,530
Now, you could eyeball that.

56
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,760
You could say, well, 8 is
definitely divisible by 4.

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,700
8 divided by 4 is 2.

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,340
80 divided by 4 is 20,
so this works.

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,740
Yes!

60
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,540
Yes!

61
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,910
So since 80 is divisible
by 4, 380 is also

62
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,290
divisible by 4, so 4 works.

63
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,855
So let's do 5.

64
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,910
I'll actually scroll
down a little bit.

65
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,370
Let's try 5.

66
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,280
So what's the pattern when
something is divisible by 5?

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,580
Let's do the multiple of 5?

68
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,930
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

69
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,270
So if something's divisible by
5-- I could keep going-- that

70
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,690
means it ends with either
a 5 or a 0, right?

71
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,215
Every multiple of 5 either has
a 5 or a 0 in the ones place.

72
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,860
Now 380 has a 0 in the
ones place, so it is

73
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,040
divisible by 5.

74
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,800
Now, let's think about
the situation for 6.

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,450
Let's think about what
happens with 6.

76
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,780
So we want to know are
we divisible by 6?

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,769
So to be divisible by 6, you
have to be divisible by the

78
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,010
things that make up 6.

79
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,960
Remember, 6 is equal
to 2 times 3.

80
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,950
So if you're divisible by 6,
that means you are divisible

81
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,120
by 2 and you are
divisible by 3.

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,830
If you're divisible by both
2 and 3, you'll be

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,500
divisible by 6.

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,680
Now, 380 is divisible by 2, but
we've already established

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,990
that it is not divisible by 3.

86
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,780
If it's not divisible by 3, it
cannot be divisible by 6, so

87
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
this gets knocked out.

88
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,710
We are not divisible by 6.

89
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,960
Now, let's go to 9.

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,790
So divisibility by 9.

91
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,100
So you can make a similar
argument here that if

92
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,950
something is not divisible by
3, there's no way it's going

93
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,270
to be divisible by 9 because
9 is equal to 3 times 3.

94
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,940
So to be divisible by 9, you
have to be divisible by 3 at

95
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,090
least twice.

96
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,060
At least two 3's have to go
into your number, and this

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,120
isn't the case, so you could
already knock 9 out.

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,870
But if we didn't already know
that we're not divisible by 3,

99
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,870
the other way to do it is a very
similar way to figure out

100
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,050
divisibility by 3.

101
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,670
We can add the digits.

102
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,300
So you add 3 plus 8 plus
0, and you get 11.

103
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,710
And you say is this
divisible by 9?

104
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,170
And you say this is not
divisible by 9, so 380 must

105
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,550
not be divisible by 9.

106
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,720
And for 3, you do the same
thing, but you test whether

107
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,540
the sum is divisible by 3.

108
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,320
For 9, you test whether
it's divisible by 9.

109
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,090
So lastly, we have
the number 10.

110
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,230
We have the number 10, and
this is on some level the

111
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,110
easiest one.

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,050
What do all the multiples
of 10 look like?

113
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,190
10, 20, 30, 40, we could just
keep going on and on.

114
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,790
They all end with zero.

115
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,030
Or if something ends with zero,
it is divisible by 10.

116
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,470
380 does end with zero, or its
ones place does have a zero on

117
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,080
it, so it is divisible by 10.

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,210
So we're divisible by all
of these numbers except

119
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,050
for 3, 6 and 9.

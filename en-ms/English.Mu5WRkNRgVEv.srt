1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,450
Convert log base
4 of 2 equals 1/2

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,050
into an exponential equation.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,990
So a logarithm
literally tells you--

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,480
so if we were to just look
at this part right over here,

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,010
a logarithm is just saying,
tell me the exponent

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,620
that I would have
to raise my base to,

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,040
that I would have to
raise 4 to, to get to 2.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,990
So tell me the
exponent that I would

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,190
have to raise it to to get to 2.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,460
And so this equation written
as a logarithmic equation says,

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,171
I need to raise 4 to the
1/2 power in order to get 2.

13
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,420
So if I wanted to write it
as an exponential equation,

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,530
I could literally just
say, well, if I raise 4--

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,150
and that's this 4
right over here.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,740
That's my base-- to this
exponent, to the 1/2 power,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,830
then that is going
to be equal to 2.

18
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,520
And we're done.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,110
We've written the same equation
as an exponential equation.

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,850
The value of a logarithm--
this is saying,

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,320
what do I get if I raise
4 to the 1/2 power?

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,390
I get 2 if I raise
4 to the 1/2 power.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,210
This is saying, what power do I
have to raise 4 to to get to 2?

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,800
And then that is equal to 1/2.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,960
So a logarithm is
saying, what power

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,530
do I have to raise
the base to to get

27
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,210
what's inside the logarithm?

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,738
This says, what do I get to
when I raise 4 to the 1/2 power?

29
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:26,238

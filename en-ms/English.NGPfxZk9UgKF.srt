1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530


2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,270
Let's do a few more problems
that bring together the

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,950
concepts that we learned
in the last two videos.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,140
So let's say we have the
inequality 4x plus 3 is less

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,850
than negative 1.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,440
So let's find all of the
x's that satisfy this.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,880
So the first thing I'd like to
do is get rid of this 3.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,430
So let's subtract 3 from both
sides of this equation.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,980
So the left-hand side is just
going to end up being 4x.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,320
These 3's cancel out.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,060
That just ends up with a zero.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,200
No reason to change the
inequality just yet.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,630
We're just adding and
subtracting from both sides,

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,375
in this case, subtracting.

15
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,780
That doesn't change the
inequality as long as we're

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,460
subtracting the same value.

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,300
We have negative 1 minus 3.

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,680
That is negative 4.

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,610
Negative 1 minus 3
is negative 4.

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,380
And then we'll want to-- let's
see, we can divide both sides

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,375
of this equation by 4.

22
00:00:55,375 --> 00:01:00,390


23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,760
Once again, when you multiply
or divide both sides of an

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,190
inequality by a positive number,
it doesn't change the

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:06,990
inequality.

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,255
So the left-hand
side is just x.

27
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:15,070
x is less than negative 4
divided by 4 is negative 1.

28
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,960
x is less than negative 1.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,210
Or we could write this
in interval notation.

30
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,080
All of the x's from negative
infinity to negative 1, but

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,900
not including negative
1, so we put a

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
parenthesis right there.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,980
Let's do a slightly
harder one.

34
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,500
Let's say we have 5x is greater
than 8x plus 27.

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,620
So let's get all our x's on the
left-hand side, and the

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,360
best way to do that is subtract
8x from both sides.

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,360
So you subtract 8x
from both sides.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,640
The left-hand side becomes
5x minus 8x.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,040
That's negative 3x.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,520
We still have a greater
than sign.

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,560
We're just adding or subtracting
the same

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
quantities on both sides.

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
These 8x's cancel out and you're
just left with a 27.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,180
So you have negative 3x
is greater than 27.

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,320
Now, to just turn this into an
x, we want to divide both

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,900
sides by negative 3.

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,450
But remember, when you multiply
or divide both sides

48
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,140
of an inequality by a negative
number, you swap the

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,550
inequality.

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:29,140
So if we divide both sides of
this by negative 3, we have to

51
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,760
swap this inequality.

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,800
It will go from being
a greater than sign

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,410
to a less than sign.

54
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,090
And just as a bit of a way that
I remember greater than

55
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,410
is that the left-hand side
just looks bigger.

56
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,550
This is greater than.

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,800
If you just imagine this height,
that height is greater

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,170
than that height right there,
which is just a point.

59
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,970
I don't know if that confuses
you or not.

60
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,830
This is less than.

61
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,090
This little point
is less than the

62
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,160
distance of that big opening.

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,490
That's how I remember it.

64
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,550
But anyway, 3x over
negative 3.

65
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,280
So now that we divided both
sides by a negative number, by

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,410
negative 3, we swapped the
inequality from greater than

67
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,870
to less than.

68
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,490
And the left-hand side, the
negative 3's cancel out.

69
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,430
You get x is less than
27 over negative 3,

70
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,820
which is negative 9.

71
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,600
Or in interval notation, it
would be everything from

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,720
negative infinity to negative
9, not including negative 9.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,350
If you wanted to do it
as a number line, it

74
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,530
would look like this.

75
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,080
This would be negative 9, maybe
this would be negative

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,350
8, maybe this would
be negative 10.

77
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,770
You would start at negative 9,
not included, because we don't

78
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,190
have an equal sign here, and
you go everything less than

79
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,860
that, all the way down, as we
see, to negative infinity.

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,540
Let's do a nice,
hairy problem.

81
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:05,930
So let's say we have 8x minus
5 times 4x plus 1 is greater

82
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,290
than or equal to negative 1
plus 2 times 4x minus 3.

83
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,330
Now, this might seem very
daunting, but if we just

84
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,240
simplify it step by step, you'll
see it's no harder than

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,269
any of the other problems
we've tackled.

86
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,519
So let's just simplify this.

87
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,990
You get 8x minus-- let's
distribute this negative 5.

88
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,590
So let me say 8x, and then
distribute the negative 5.

89
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,560
Negative 5 times 4x
is negative 20x.

90
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,760
Negative 5-- when I say negative
5, I'm talking about

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,650
this whole thing.

92
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,510
Negative 5 times 1 is negative
5, and then that's going to be

93
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,660
greater than or equal
to negative 1 plus

94
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,210
2 times 4x is 8x.

95
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,940
2 times negative 3
is negative 6.

96
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,490
And now we can merge these two
terms. 8x minus 20x is

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:04,120
negative 12x minus 5 is greater
than or equal to-- we

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,040
can merge these constant terms.
Negative 1 minus 6,

99
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,070
that's negative 7, and then we
have this plus 8x left over.

100
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,620
Now, I like to get all my x
terms on the left-hand side,

101
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,255
so let's subtract 8x from both
sides of this equation.

102
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:30,670


103
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm subtracting 8x.

104
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,900
This left-hand side, negative
12 minus 8,

105
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
that's negative 20.

106
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,270
Negative 20x minus 5.

107
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,710
Once again, no reason
to change the

108
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,380
inequality just yet.

109
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,910
All we're doing is simplifying
the sides, or adding and

110
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,740
subtracting from them.

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,220
The right-hand side becomes--
this thing cancels out, 8x

112
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,600
minus 8x, that's 0.

113
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,690
So you're just left
with a negative 7.

114
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,690
And now I want to get rid
of this negative 5.

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,910
So let's add 5 to both sides
of this equation.

116
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,860


117
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,540
The left-hand side, you're just
left with a negative 20x.

118
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,600
These 5's cancel out.

119
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,300
No reason to change the
inequality just yet.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,330
Negative 7 plus 5, that's
negative 2.

121
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,710
Now, we're at an interesting
point.

122
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,810
We have negative 20x is greater
than or equal to

123
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,460
negative 2.

124
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,000
If this was an equation, or
really any type of an

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,740
inequality, we want to divide
both sides by negative 20.

126
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,520
But we have to remember, when
you multiply or divide both

127
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,370
sides of an inequality by a
negative number, you have to

128
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,810
swap the inequality.

129
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,250
So let's remember that.

130
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,761
So if we divide this side by
negative 20 and we divide this

131
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:50,900
side by negative 20, all I did
is took both of these sides

132
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,350
divided by negative 20, we have
to swap the inequality.

133
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,560
The greater than or equal to has
to become a less than or

134
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,990
equal sign.

135
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,380
And, of course, these cancel
out, and you get x is less

136
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,550
than or equal to-- the
negatives cancel

137
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,590
out-- 2/20 is 1/10.

138
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,490
If we were writing it in
interval notation, the upper

139
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,440
bound would be 1/10.

140
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,670
Notice, we're including it,
because we have an equal sign,

141
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,220
less than or equal, so we're
including 1/10, and we're

142
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,210
going to go all the way down
to negative infinity,

143
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,260
everything less than
or equal to 1/10.

144
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,600
This is just another way
of writing that.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,670
And just for fun, let's
draw the number line.

146
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,380
Let's draw the number
line right here.

147
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,520
This is maybe 0, that is 1.

148
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,610
1/10 might be over here.

149
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,090
Everything less than
or equal to 1/10.

150
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,620
So we're going to include the
1/10 and everything less than

151
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,010
that is included in
the solution set.

152
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,900
And you could try out any
value less than 1/10 and

153
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,400
verify that it will satisfy
this inequality.

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,333

00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:05,167
Welcome to the presentation on subtracting decimal numbers.

2
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07,703
Let's get started with some problems.

3
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:21,314
The first problem I have here says five point seven three

4
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:30,814
minus point zero eight two one equals who knows?

5
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,527
So the first thing you always want to do with a decimal like this,

6
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,578
and I actually kind of inadvertently did this,

7
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,910
is that you want to line up the decimals.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,302
So you actually want this decimal to be right above this decimal.

9
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,398
I almost did that when I did it,

10
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:44,860
it must have been my subconscious doing it.

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,280
But let me just do it a little bit neater.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:54,005
So it's five point seven three, and I'll put the decimal here.

13
00:00:54,005 --> 00:01:00,040
Decimal zero eight two one.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,355
And some people say it's good to always put a zero in front of the decimal.

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,205
My wife's a doctor and she says it's critical

16
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:08,515
otherwise you might give someone the wrong amount of medicine.

17
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:10,110
So, we've lined up the decimals

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,908
and now we're ready to subtract.

19
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,685
So one thing that you have to think about when you do decimals

20
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:21,728
is we're going to have to subtract this twenty-one ten thousandths

21
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:23,880
or this two and this one from something.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,460
We can't just subtract it from this blank space.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,044
So we have to add two zeros here.

24
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:33,542
And as you know, with the decimal when you add zeros to the end of it,

25
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,968
it really doesn't change the value of the decimal.

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,188
So at this point,

27
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:40,650
we just view this like a level four subtraction problem.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,385
So the first thing we do in any subtraction problem

29
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:45,914
is see if any of the numbers on top

30
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:47,750
are smaller than any of the numbers on the bottom.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,330
Well in this case there are a lot of them.

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,030
So this zero is less than this one, this zero is less than this two,

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,400
this three is less than this eight.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,770
So we're going to have to borrow.

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,565
Some people will like to do their borrowing and subtracting,

36
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:02,240
they kind of alternate between the two.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,510
I like to do all of my borrowing ahead of time.

38
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,540
So what I do is I start in the top right and I say

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,990
okay, zero is less than one.

40
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,660
So that zero becomes a ten.

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,125
But in order to become a ten,

42
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,610
I would have had to borrow one from some place.

43
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,857
I look to the left of that zero

44
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:21,490
and I say well, can I borrow the one from zero?

45
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,560
Well, no.

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,430
This is just the way I do it.

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,215
There are people who would actually let you borrow the one from the zero,

48
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,512
but I say no, instead of borrowing the one from the zero,

49
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:30,893
I borrow the one from this entire thirty.

50
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:33,845
So this thirty -- see right there, this is three zero

51
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:39,563
so I'm going to borrow one from it and it becomes twenty-nine.

52
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:44,864
So we borrowed one from this thirty to get a ten here,

53
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,690
and now let's check again to see if all of our numbers on top

54
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,890
are larger than all the numbers on the bottom.

55
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,842
Well ten is larger than one, nine is larger than two,

56
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,280
two is not larger than eight.

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,220
So we have to borrow again.

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,122
So if we're going to borrow,

59
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:05,517
the two becomes a twelve, and the seven--

60
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:08,171
we borrowed one from that -- becomes a six.

61
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,025
So let's check again.

62
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:14,367
Ten is larger than one, nine is larger than two, twelve is larger than eight,

63
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:17,280
six is larger than zero, and five is larger than zero.

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,745
So now we've done all of our borrowing and we're ready to do some subtraction,

65
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,000
and this is the easy part.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,620
Ten minus one is nine.

67
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,450
Nine minus two is seven.

68
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,360
Twelve minus eight is four.

69
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,410
Six minus zero is six.

70
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,910
Five minus zero is five.

71
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,620
And we just bring down the decimal point.

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,840
So there's our answer.

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:55,120
Five point seven three minus zero point zero eight two one is equal to five point six four seven nine.

74
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,520
There you go.

75
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,850
I probably confused you, so let's do some more problems.

76
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,242
Here's another one.

77
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:11,872
Eight -- let me leave some space on top to do the borrowing.

78
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:25,870
Eight point two five minus zero point zero one zero five.

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,090
So what was that first step that I always have to do?

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,020
Right.

81
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,180
To line up the decimals.

82
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,710
So let me do that.

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:46,070
So it's eight point two five and zero point zero one zero five.

84
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,290
Notice I lined up this decimal right below this decimal.

85
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,689
Now I add the zeros,

86
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,030
just because this zero and this five need to be subtracted from something.

87
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,620
Now let me do my borrowing.

88
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,888
So once again, all I do is check to see

89
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:03,170
whether the top number is larger than the number below it.

90
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,550
Well, this zero is smaller than five, so I'm going to have to borrow.

91
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,350
So I'm going to borrow.

92
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,744
I can't borrow from this zero,

93
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,980
I have to borrow from this entire fifty.

94
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,875
So this fifty, if I borrow one from fifty I get forty-nine.

95
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,887
And this zero will then become a ten, right?

96
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:26,050
I borrowed one from fifty to get a ten.

97
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,560
Now, am I done?

98
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,430
Ten is larger than five.

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,540
Nine is larger than zero.

100
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,970
Four is larger than one.

101
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,900
Two is larger than zero.

102
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,520
Eight is larger than zero.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,600
So I think I'm ready to subtract.

104
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,120
Ten minus five, well that's five.

105
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,230
Nine minus zero is nine.

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,130
Four minus one is three.

107
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,690
Two minus zero is two.

108
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,950
Eight minus zero is eight.

109
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,720
And I bring down the decimal point.

110
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,895
So if you mastered level four subtraction,

111
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:08,430
the decimal problems really are just about lining up the decimal point,

112
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,419
adding the zeros and then just doing a normal subtraction problem.

113
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,867
In general with subtraction,

114
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:17,250
I think most people have the most trouble with the borrowing.

115
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,082
The way I do it I think is a little bit different than is taught in a lot of schools.

116
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,130
A lot of schools they'll do the subtraction,

117
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,660
and they'll borrow alternatively.

118
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,038
But I find this easier when I just borrow ahead of time,

119
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,387
and I also, like for example in this problem, when I had to make this zero into a ten,

120
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:33,766
instead of borrowing from the zero, which is not intuitive

121
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,810
because I can't really borrow from the zero,

122
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,710
I borrowed from this entire fifty, and I made that into a forty-nine.

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,107
Let's do one more problem.

124
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:58,937
If I have two point six four minus zero point zero four eight six.

125
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:01,670
So once again, let's line up the decimal points.

126
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:11,720
Two point six four and it's point zero four eight six.

127
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,610
Lined up the decimal points, include the zeros on top.

128
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,370
You're going to have a zero here, so I have to borrow.

129
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,480
Becomes a ten.

130
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,542
Can't borrow from the zero,

131
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,910
so I have to borrow from this entire forty.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,391
So this forty becomes a thirty-nine.

133
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:29,430
I think I'm running out of space.

134
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,430
So ten is larger than six.

135
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
Nine is larger than eight.

136
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,410
Three is not larger than four.

137
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,863
So this three I'm going to have to borrow.

138
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:41,208
So three becomes a thirteen.

139
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,575
And this six becomes a five.

140
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:46,030
This is really bad, I shouldn't do it so messy.

141
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,178
But now we say the ten is larger than six, the nine is larger than the eight,

142
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,550
this thirteen should be on top of that three.

143
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,719
The thirteen is larger than four, and five is larger than zero.

144
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:57,110
So we're ready to subtract.

145
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,260
Ten minus six is four.

146
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,570
Nine minus eight is one.

147
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,310
Thirteen minus four is nine.

148
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,790
Five minus zero is five.

149
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,870
Two minus nothing is two.

150
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,170
Bring down the decimal point.

151
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:21,520
So two point six four minus point zero four eight six is equal to two point five nine one four.

152
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,163
Hope I didn't confuse you too much.

153
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:28,684
But I think you're ready now to try the subtraction of decimals.

154
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,240
Have fun!

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,510
Write 5 and 1/4 as
an improper fraction.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,710
So just as a reminder,
an improper fraction

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,550
is one where the
numerator is greater

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,550
than or equal to
the denominator.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,160
So improper fraction means that
the numerator-- and actually,

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,900
I should say the absolute
value of the numerator--

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,360
is greater than or equal
to the absolute value

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,690
of the denominator.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,960
I could have just shortened
it, but you get the idea.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,077
The numerator is greater
than or equal to--

12
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:30,660
or the absolute value
of the numerator

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,600
is greater than or equal
to the absolute value

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,820
of the denominator.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,570
In this situation right
here, it's a mixed number.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,750
We have it as a combination
of 5, which is just

17
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,180
a whole number, and 1/4,
which is a proper fraction,

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,550
because the numerator is
less than the denominator.

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,030
The absolute value
of the numerator

20
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,430
is less than the absolute
value of the denominator.

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,507
So to write it as an
improper fraction--

22
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:53,840
and I'll show you kind of the
methodology for doing it--

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,190
and then we'll talk a
little bit about why

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,830
that methodology works.

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,590
So 5 and 1/4, the methodology
is pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,050
You say, OK, 5,
the whole number 5,

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,570
that is the same
thing as 20 over 4.

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,250
And so 20 over 4 plus
1 over 4 is 21 over 4.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,900
Or another way to think about
it is, 5 times 4 is 20, plus 1

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,400
is 21.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,857
21 over 4.

32
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:21,940
So that's the methodology.

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,970
Pretty straightforward.

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,400
And I'm going to
draw it out so it

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,660
makes a little bit more sense.

36
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,930
So once again, you
take the mixed number,

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,310
or you take the whole
part of the mixed number,

38
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,030
you multiply it times the
denominator, you get 20.

39
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,304
And then you add that 20
to 1, you get 21 over 4.

40
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,720
And now it's an
improper fraction.

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,178
The absolute value
of our numerator

42
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,650
is greater than the absolute
value of our denominator.

43
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,530
Now I do want to show
you why this works.

44
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,240
So to see why this
works, let's think

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,290
about what 5 and 1/4 means.

46
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,320
It means we have 5 wholes.

47
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,730
So let's say that
this is a whole.

48
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,100
So that's 1 whole.

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,955
And let me copy and
paste it five times.

50
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:05,600

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:14,050
So that's 2, that's 3,
that's 4, and then that is 5.

52
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,950
So we have five wholes.

53
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,290
So that's this stuff
that I've drawn in green.

54
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,540
That's 5 holes right there.

55
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,610
And then we have 1/4.

56
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,450

57
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,320
So I'll do 1/4 of a whole.

58
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,192

59
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:35,150
And just to be clear that
it's part of a whole,

60
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,890
I could have drawn the
whole in a dotted line,

61
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,730
to say that we don't have that
whole, we have only 1/4 of it.

62
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,570
And that's that 1/4.

63
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,570
So this is 5 and 1/4.

64
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,370
So to write it as an
improper fraction,

65
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,360
you can really view this
5 as some fraction over 4.

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,990
And to think of it that
way, divide each of these

67
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,910
into fourths.

68
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,680
Or this is one way
to think about it.

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,040
So this right over here is
4/4, this is another 4/4,

70
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,710
this is another 4/4-- I should
have copied and pasted this--

71
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,490
this is another 4/4,
and this is another 4/4.

72
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,452
So now how many
fourths do we have?

73
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:13,160
How many fourths?

74
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,530
We have 4/4 here, 4/4 here, 4/4
here, 4/4 here, and 4/4 here.

75
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,910
So just what we have in green.

76
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,760

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,125
We have 20 fourths.

78
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,294

79
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,210
That's what we have in
green, right over here.

80
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,870
That is the same thing as 5.

81
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,540
Each of these are 4/4, so you
could view this as 5 times

82
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,950
4/4, right?

83
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,800
4/4 is 1.

84
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,720
5 times 4/4 is 20 over 4.

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
That's what we have
right over here.

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,550
And now we can add
it to that 1/4.

87
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,010

88
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,200
And you will get 21.

89
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,460
We have the same denominator.

90
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,030
So we can just add
the numerators.

91
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,319
21 over 4.

92
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,610
So that's the conceptual
understanding of why it works.

93
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,026
But when you see
any mixed number,

94
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:03,650
it's a pretty
straightforward process.

95
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,646
Multiply the 5
times 4, you get 20.

96
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,892
20 plus 1 is equal to 21 over 4.

97
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,600
And actually, let me
just write that out.

98
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,410
Just so you get clear
on what I'm doing.

99
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,980
So 5 and 1/4, that
is the same thing--

100
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:24,220
that's equal to 5
times 4 plus 1, over 4.

101
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,320
And this is why.

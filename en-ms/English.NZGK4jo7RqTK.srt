1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,510
Jayda takes 3 hours to deliver
189 newspapers

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,840
on her paper route.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,080
What is the rate per
hour at which she

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,040
delivers the newspaper?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,610
So this first sentence tells us
that she delivers, or she

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:26,180
takes, 3 hours to deliver
189 newspapers.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,840
So you have 3 hours for
every 189 newspapers.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,970
That's what the first
sentence told us.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,660
But we want to figure out the
rate per hour, or the

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,380
newspapers per hour, so we can
really just flip this rate

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,960
right here.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:51,460
So if we were to just flip it,
we would have 189 newspapers

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:59,950
for every 3 hours, which is
really the same information.

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,610
We're just flipping what's in
the numerator and what's in

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,860
the denominator.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,340
Now we want to write it in as
simple as possible form, and

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,940
let's see if this top number
is divisible by 3.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,240
1 plus 8 is 9, plus 9 is 18.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,810
So that is divisible by 3.

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,120
So let's divide this numerator
and this denominator by 3 to

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,500
simplify things.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,930
So if you divide 189 by 3.

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,300
Let's do it over on the
side right here.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,450
3 goes into 189.

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,500
3 goes into 18 six times.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,600
6 times 3 is 18.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,720
Subtract.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,190
Bring down the 9.

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,220
18 minus 18 was nothing.

30
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,380
3 goes into 9 exactly
three times.

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,150
3 times 3 is 9, no remainder.

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,880
So if you divide 189 by 3, you
get 63, and if you divide 3 by

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,390
3, you're going to get 1.

34
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,710
You have to divide both the
numerator and the denominator

35
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,440
by the same number.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,490
So now we have 63 newspapers
for every 1 hour.

37
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:06,070
Or we could write this as 63
over 1 newspapers per hour.

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,280
Or we could write this as 63,
because 63 over 1 is the same

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:30,230
thing as 63 newspapers
per hour.

Episode 10

3
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,267
I will call you, Mother .

4
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:36,233
Seung Jo, take care of yourself. Eat your meals, and eat lots of vegetables and fruits.

5
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:40,412
And don't wander during the night. And...

6
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:42,033
I know, I know.

7
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,825
If you need anything, call me.

8
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,233
I don't need anything.

9
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:56,968
You have to come home once in a while, okay ?

10
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:58,633
I'm going Eun Jo.

11
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:25,007
Hyung.

12
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,267
<i>He left.

13
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:33,476
He really left like that.

14
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:42,367
I was so happy about living in this house with Seung Jo...

15
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:47,933
Even if he's cold towards me...even if he's says things I don't like...

16
00:01:47,933 --> 00:02:00,867
It was nice just being with him .

17
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,567
Ha Ni...don't cry.

18
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,567
Let's wait...

19
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:25,467
He didn't go far away. So he'll come back really soon...

20
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,467
<i>Now I can't see him anywhere but at school.

21
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:30,333
<i>He'll probably...

22
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:39,333
<i>Seung Jo will probably forget me.

23
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,000
Ha Ni!

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,001
Oh Ha Ni!

25
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,467
Hey! Oh Ha Ni!

26
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,493
Huh?

27
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:49,467
Did you say something?

28
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:53,933
Please pull yourself together. You've lost your mind.

29
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:58,667
Everyday for a week, you've been like an octopus without bones. An octopus.

30
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:05,003
I understand that you're sad because Seung Jo left the house, but this is not my friend, Ha Ni.

31
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:10,008
Pull yourself together, okay ?

32
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:14,433
Oh!

33
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:19,993
It's Seung Jo.

34
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:21,933
What are you doing? You missed him so much.

35
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,633
-Hurry up and go act like you know him. -No.

36
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:29,001
For some reason I'm scared to talk to him .

37
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:34,005
Joo Ri is on her lunch break. Let's go and eat.

38
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:39,001
Huh?

39
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:44,004
We need two more King Chops.

40
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:47,733
Ha Ni went back to where she was a long time ago, huh ?

41
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,733
It's the same as it was in high school .

42
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,933
Here.

43
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,633
Ha Ni, you came?

44
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,333
You're humming. You must be in a good mood, Bong Joon Gu .

45
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,533
Of course.

46
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:07,133
Since I'm working with a stable mind now, Ha Ni will come to me.

47
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:10,001
This is nothing different than me beating Baek Seung Jo.

48
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:16,009
Then, Ha Ni will come to me on her knees.

49
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:17,966
please give me a King Cutlet .

50
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:29,233
Yes. Eat!

51
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:32,933
Baek Seung Jo... where is he?

52
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,007
Don't know.

53
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,933
What about where he works?

54
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,367
Don't know.

55
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:44,067
Hey Oh Ha Ni. You're saying a girl like you doesn't know that?

56
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:49,533
I don't know anymore.

57
00:04:49,533 --> 00:05:11,433
Having a crush is really sad.

58
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,933
You're alright Ha Ni?

59
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,733
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:22,567
For what?

61
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:23,867
What happened to Ha Ni?

62
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,233
Isn't she a bit strange?

63
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,767
They say Baek Seung Jo left his house.

64
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,767
She's in shock.

65
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:41,033
Let's practice.

66
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,008
<i>Seung Jo isn't coming for practice.

67
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>I already knew he wouldn't, but I was thinking maybe...

68
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,004
Hey, Oh Ha Ni!

69
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:56,003
You can't even pick up the balls properly?

70
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,133
Yes...

71
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:03,167
Ah really!

72
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,067
Ha Ni!

73
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:09,233
Do you feel like buying me dinner?

74
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,167
I don't.

75
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,667
Really?

76
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:18,733
That's a shame. I was going to let you in on some information about Baek Seung Jo.

77
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:20,667
If you don't want to, it's fine. Let's practice.

78
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:25,533
I'll buy it, sunbae! I'll buy it, sunbae!

79
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll buy it, I'll buy it!

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know a good place.

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,005
Yes?

82
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:34,001
It's not an expensive place, so you don't need to be pressured.

83
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:37,004
Besides that... the information you were talking about...

84
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:40,433
Ah information.

85
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:48,006
As you may already know, Seung Jo doesn't hide anything from me. So if I tell you, it's pretty good information.

86
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:51,667
After practice, I'll take you where Seung Jo is working part time.

87
00:06:51,667 --> 00:07:08,767
What !?!?

88
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,333
Seung Jo works here?

89
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,003
Yeah. He's a waiter here. I introduced him to this place.

90
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:22,233
I actually work here on the weekends too. Let's go in.

91
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,267
<i>Baek Seung Jo working at a family restaurant...

92
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:30,667
<i>I can't believe it.

93
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:35,967
Welcome. How many...? Oh Kyung Su shi. Do you work today?

94
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,233
No, I'm here as a customer. The two of us.

95
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,933
Ah, yeah. Two persons?

96
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,867
Please come this way.

97
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:46,003
Yes.Let's go

98
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:51,933
Ah they added this. It wasn't here last week.

99
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,667
Ha Ni.Ha Ni!

100
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,005
Yes?

101
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,633
Quit looking around and order.

102
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,767
Yes.

103
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:05,009
The Fresh Date Salad sounds okay.

104
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:10,001
The picture of the Garlic Steak Pie looks okay too.

105
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:13,667
Have you decided?

106
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,007
Why don't you just roughly decide?

107
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,433
Yes, I...

108
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,003
If you have thought about it for 15 minutes, that should be enough.

109
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,003
Baek Seung Jo.

110
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:24,367
Will it be the Grilled Soy sauce Salmon set?

111
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:29,767
Or is it the Fresh Date Salad? Or the Garlic Baked Chicken?

112
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,967
I'll have the Grilled Soy sauce Salmon.

113
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,132
Fresh Date Salad.

114
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:36,432
Ah, and tea...

115
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,004
What kind of salad dressing would you like?

116
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:43,933
-Pinenut dressing..-Would you like peach or lemon for your tea?

117
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:44,867
Lemon.

118
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,067
Shall I serve the tea after your meal?

119
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:47,633
Yes.

120
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:55,003
Please wait a while.

121
00:08:55,003 --> 00:09:00,233
Ha Ni, what do you think? I was right wasn't....

122
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:03,033
What?Are you crying now?

123
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,367
Punk, being a baby.

124
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:10,001
It's been so long since I've talked with Seung Jo.

125
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:14,001
Did you talk with him just now? I heard it as ordering.

126
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,005
Excuse me.

127
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:16,008
Can I get a refill on my cola?

128
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:19,008
Yes.

129
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,006
Shall I give you more?

130
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:23,005
Yes.

131
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:31,003
How can he look so cool in a uniform too?

132
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,367
Sunbae...

133
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,767
Do you by any chance know where Seung Jo is living?

134
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,467
House?

135
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:48,823
I don't know that much yet.

136
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,671
You have been waiting for long!

137
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:56,099
Grilled Soy sauce Salmon.

138
00:09:56,099 --> 00:10:00,059
Lemon chicken and fresh date salad for you

139
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,757
Really Looks delicious

140
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:06,454
Enjoy your meal

141
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,519
Seung Jo

142
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,773
Hello!

143
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:11,823
Where do you live now?

144
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,681
I'm working now...

145
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,257
Are you angry? Because I'm here?

146
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,079
I knew you'd come sooner or later,

147
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:30,657
however don't be a tattle-tale about this.

148
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:43,049
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

149
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,049
That's it!

150
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:46,199
What?

151
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,023
That!

152
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,789
If I do part-time here,

153
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,557
I can very very casually...

154
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:53,089
I can be with Seung Jo

155
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,857
But this is quite the opposite of casual.

156
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:03,025
Just a second.

157
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:05,557
Oh? Part time?

158
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,069
Yes. I'll do my best!

159
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,857
I'm sorry. What to do?

160
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:10,723
Yes?

161
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:14,089
I just hired someone a minute ago, so the positions are all filled.

162
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,958
Yes?!

163
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,857
Sorry, but maybe next time.

164
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,757
You!

165
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:24,891
Why are you here?

166
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,089
A part time job. I see you're a second late.

167
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:31,223
Excuse me, don't you have any other positions?!

168
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,757
Sorry but we don't need any more right now.

169
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:37,657
Well then, please work hard starting today!

170
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:40,223
Looks like the tables have turned.

171
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:41,957
What is?

172
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:47,557
Ever since Seung Jo left his house, the only place you could meet Seung Jo is at the tennis club, right?

173
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:51,223
But then again Seung Jo barely ever goes.

174
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:54,079
I was in the same class and work in a part-time job in the same place as Seung Jo.

175
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,069
Goodness why do I keep feeling like I'm taking candy from you?

176
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:10,923
Well, I have to go to work so see you!

177
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:13,069
Oh gosh that was good.

178
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:19,099
Hey Ha Ni thanks to you, I really enjoyed my meal.

179
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:24,089
Oh right ! Did you get the part time job?

180
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,009
Great, it's all figured out then.

181
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,023
You have to be thankful to me.

182
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,023
It's all thanks to me.

183
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:33,557
Let's go now.

184
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:36,757
You're leaving ma'am?

185
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:40,123
There's still the tea left in your set meal.

186
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,457
Oh!

187
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:44,069
Can you just save it for me for tomorrow?

188
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:45,423
Excuse me?!

189
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,523
The tea...

190
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:50,723
Can't I come back tomorrow and drink it?

191
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,009
We cannot do that.

192
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:57,764
And I am not thankful at all if you show up tomorrow as well.

193
00:12:57,764 --> 00:13:00,069
I won't bother you.

194
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:04,423
In the end, I'm still a customer.

195
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,223
Hey!

196
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:08,557
Don't you dare tell my family.

197
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:20,009
Then does that mean I can come?

198
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:20,079
Busy, huh?

199
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,623
Yeah, probably because there are a lot of customers.

200
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,257
How is living alone?

201
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:30,099
I just can't leave feeling at ease when Hae Ra is always around.

202
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,857
I need to come tomorrow and the day after as well.

203
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:35,757
Ha Ni, what are you doing? Lets go!

204
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:44,623
Anyway, I'm happy I could see Seung Jo.

205
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:49,964
I'm back home!

206
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,631
Oh! Ha Ni

207
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,698
You haven't eaten dinner yet have you? Come here, let's eat together

208
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,664
I already ate out.

209
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:58,664
Oh my!

210
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:01,974
Ha Ni it's been a long time since I've seen you smile

211
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,631
Did something happen?

212
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:05,766
Huh?

213
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:08,431
No. Just......

214
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:15,164
You've been so sad since Seung Jo moved out. I was worried about you.

215
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:20,098
Mother, Seung Jo is...

216
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,973
Don't you dare tell my family.

217
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:22,831
What!

218
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:27,064
Seung Jo is working part time at a family restaurant!

219
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:32,998
It was supposed to be a secret.

220
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,498
I had dinner there.

221
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,964
Oh my, oh my, it must have been so much fun!

222
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,231
I want to see it myself.

223
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:41,331
Right Eun Jo?! Seung Jo is a waiter!

224
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,931
I want to see him too

225
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:47,998
Then shall the three of us have dinner there tomorrow?

226
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,049
Huh?

227
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,098
But he said it was a secret...

228
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,264
Oh Ha Ni no need to be shy!

229
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:58,931
Alright then. How about all of us disguising ourselves?

230
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,298
We'll sit off to the side.

231
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:18,664
Yeah!

232
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:24,131
<i> Seung Jo, what are you doing all by yourself?

233
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:29,898
<i>Are you making dinner or are you reading a book?

234
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:33,164
<i> Where in the world are you living right now?

235
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:36,672
I would like mushrooms and lotus leaves over rice, cabbage salad, and omija tea.

236
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:39,131
I would like abalone porridge, with grilled green tea mountain roots.

237
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:41,131
Blueberry sorbet after the meal.

238
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:43,531
I would like diced hot rice cakes with vegetables.

239
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:46,531
And please don't add any pepper on my grilled salmon.

240
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:50,231
I would like the grilled rib steak with 6 pieces of lemon chicken, actually 8 pieces.

241
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,098
Instead of the abalone porridge, I would like the chicken breast.

242
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:55,231
He won't know if we all order like this, so let's clear it up.

243
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:55,937
What did you get?

244
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,964
Allow me to confirm your orders.

245
00:15:57,964 --> 00:16:01,131
Mushroom and lotus leaves over rice, cabbage salad, and omija tea.

246
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:04,864
Grilled green tea mountain roots, and the rice cakes with vegetables.

247
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,598
Grilled salmon with no pepper.

248
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:11,831
Grilled chicken with orange sorbet.

249
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:12,798
You forgot mine?

250
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:21,038
Yes, the blueberry sorbet after the meal. That's all.

251
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:24,431
I don't think he even jotted it down.

252
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:30,498
He's so smart, he must have memorized it all!

253
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:31,898
Hyung, you're so cool!

254
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,832
He's definitely a prodigy.

255
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:36,764
But he's not very cute.

256
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:40,098
My Seung Jo is cutest when he smiles.

257
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:45,264
Do you think Hyung has recognized us?

258
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:50,664
Hey Ha Ni, there's no way he could recognize us when we're disguised this well!

259
00:16:50,664 --> 00:17:03,531
Excuse me!

260
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:05,598
Are you ready to order?

261
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:08,099
Should we eat the lotus leaf steak?

262
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,557
I want half lemon chicken half seasoned chicken.

263
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:16,323
I want to eat something I haven't tried.

264
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:17,957
Hurry up!

265
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:20,069
What is today's special?

266
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,123
Fried yam salad.

267
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:23,059
Oh I had that yesterday ...

268
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,857
Hey Ha Ni!

269
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:31,823
Idiot, Hyung probably already recognized us.

270
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:36,057
Is this you in disguise?

271
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:41,523
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:44,523
Oh it's Seung Jo's mother and Eun Jo.

273
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,157
Welcome.

274
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,957
Oh my gosh, why are you here?!

275
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:51,623
I work here part time with Seung Jo.

276
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:53,123
What?!

277
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:54,079
What were you doing, Ha Ni?!

278
00:17:54,079 --> 00:18:04,019
I'm sorry. Yoon Hae Ra made a move first!

279
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,523
Son, come home once in awhile.

280
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:11,059
And be careful not to fall for Hae Ra, not at all!

281
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,018
I get it.

282
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:19,009
Seung Jo, come on and tell me where you live.

283
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:29,389
Hurry and leave!

284
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,523
Alright Ha Ni? You cannot lose to Hae Ra.

285
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:36,059
Don't you care what he says about you being persistent or tired of you.

286
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,723
You have to meet him everyday. Stick to him like glue!

287
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,957
Come here every day, alright?

288
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:43,059
Yes!

289
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,323
There's nothing like a stalker.

290
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:49,357
My sad Hyung. Poor Seung Jo.

291
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,019
What?!

292
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:55,557
Really?!

293
00:18:55,557 --> 00:19:02,023
Yeah, it looks like Hae Ra has attached herself to Seung Jo.

294
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:04,923
Hae Ra's pretty darn persistent too.

295
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:09,523
Now that this has happened, you have no choice but to go every day as well.

296
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,757
Don't you think Seung Jo will dislike it?

297
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:15,123
Oh my gosh! What in the world are you talking about?!

298
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:21,123
It's Oh Ha Ni to happily go after him whether he runs away or doesn't like it.

299
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:28,009
Like a cicada that sticks to a tree like glue and cries all summer long!

300
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:30,657
Okay. That's it!

301
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:32,457
A cicada stuck to a tree!

302
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:42,423
But the problem is...Do you have the time and money to go visit Seung Jo every single day?

303
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:47,633
Oh...

304
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,723
Are you renting this place?

305
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,099
Are you studying today again?

306
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,856
I have a paper that I have to turn in by next week.

307
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,556
I'll get the order here.

308
00:19:57,556 --> 00:20:01,656
Ah...Okay.

309
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:02,956
Why did you purposely come?

310
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:06,656
It seemed like you were going to eat my friend.

311
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:08,423
What would you like?

312
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,223
Give me anything.

313
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:11,823
Yes, I understand.

314
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:21,913
Then, just a little bit...

315
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:27,069
The food you ordered has come out.

316
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:33,156
Could you please move your books?

317
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:36,123
What is this?

318
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:40,029
This is our restaurant's most popular Super Special Set.

319
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,927
This big...

320
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:43,756
Is this a duck?

321
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:48,669
Not a duck... a chicken.

322
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:50,856
Didn't you tell me to get you anything?

323
00:20:50,856 --> 00:21:29,823
Then enjoy your meal. Thank you, thank you!

324
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,019
Customer!

325
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:39,846
Should I give you a fifth cup of coffee?

326
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:44,104
If you drink six cups of black coffee everyday, your stomach will feel terrible.

327
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:47,099
Aigoo, thank you. You even worry about me?

328
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,923
It's okay.

329
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:52,259
I'm nothing if not healthy.

330
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:59,323
What guy in this world would like a girl that sits here all day wasting her life away watching him.

331
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:04,223
If I were a guy, I'd probably get really tired of it.

332
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:10,436
Well anyways, work hard.

333
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:15,029
Even if you do that, see if I leave.

334
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:24,956
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

335
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:27,039
Excuse me, customer!

336
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,099
Customer!

337
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,099
There isn't much time until we close.

338
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:36,356
Ah... yes.

339
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,946
It's 123,000 won all together.

340
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:42,079
What's that expensive?

341
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,823
You had a Super Special Set and 7 cups of coffee.

342
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,823
Super... whatever it is... how much is it?

343
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:52,456
It is 58000 won.

344
00:22:52,456 --> 00:23:06,156
A moment please.

345
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:19,056
Wait a moment please.

346
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,039
Here.

347
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,623
Yes.

348
00:23:21,623 --> 00:23:26,656
Thank you.

349
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:35,956
Excuse me. Until what time does Baek Seung Jo work?

350
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,327
Aye, tell me.

351
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:42,056
I'm not sure. It's probably until 9 pm.

352
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:43,923
Ah, really?

353
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,656
Thank you.

354
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:48,156
At 9 pm?

355
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:52,256
Since it's 8:30 now...

356
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:54,323
He should be getting off soon.

357
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:55,029
Good.

358
00:23:55,029 --> 00:24:00,256
Today, I will go see where Seung Jo lives.

359
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:29,079
Of course, just slightly.

360
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,823
Were you waiting?

361
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,493
I just came out.

362
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:34,556
Really? It is a relief.

363
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,756
Oh, I am tired.

364
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:49,638
-Let's hurry-Okay.

365
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:53,431
They're just going together because they live in the same area.

366
00:24:53,431 --> 00:25:52,572
It has to be like that.

367
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:54,138
What is this?

368
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,205
Seung Jo...

369
00:25:56,205 --> 00:27:30,172
With Hae Ra...

370
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,672
Ha Ni! What happened?

371
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:33,373
Why are you so late?

372
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:38,838
I was worried. It's past midnight already.

373
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:40,338
I am sorry.

374
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:44,138
Was there a club meeting?

375
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:46,105
Did something happen?

376
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:50,065
No, everything is alright.

377
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:53,538
What about a bath? Should I get the water ready for you?

378
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,156
I am just going to sleep today.

379
00:27:57,156 --> 00:28:01,338
Good night.

380
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:03,305
Okay.

381
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:10,544
Good night.

382
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:41,562
Strange.

383
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:44,096
<i>Seung Jo, who used to be right next door...

384
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:47,217
<i>now lives with Hae Ra now.

385
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:50,796
<i>What was all that talk about not hating me?

386
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,101
<i>He doesn't hate me...

387
00:28:53,101 --> 00:29:04,929
<i>but he likes He Ra. Is that it?

388
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:27,062
Right now, those two...

389
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:28,636
I'll be back.

390
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,512
Oh my, Ha Ni!

391
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:33,505
There are dark circles under your eyes!

392
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,762
And your eyes are swollen.

393
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:38,478
You look a bit sickly.

394
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:39,896
Really?

395
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,962
I couldn't sleep that well.

396
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:44,087
Aren't you studying too much?

397
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:46,962
That could never happen.

398
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:48,396
Are you okay?

399
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:50,628
What do you think about taking a day off of school today?

400
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:51,054
I'm okay.

401
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:56,196
If you feel worse, ask Seung Jo to bring you home.

402
00:29:56,196 --> 00:30:01,896
If you show that face to our hyung, he'll probably faint.

403
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,762
He probably will.

404
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,362
I better be careful.

405
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:08,929
Then, I'll be back.

406
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:10,329
Hey Ha Ni, what about breakfast?

407
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:13,006
I don't have an appetite.

408
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:21,496
Then.

409
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:25,702
What do you think happened to Ha Ni?

410
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:31,135
It seems like it's not something normal.

411
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:34,079
What could it be?

412
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,996
Ah, really!

413
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:38,514
Are you on a diet?

414
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:41,826
Why aren't you eating these days?!

415
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:43,955
It's because I don't have an appetite...

416
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:47,022
What's the matter? It's because of Baek Seung Jo, isn't it?

417
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:50,371
Tell us, we will listen.

418
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:53,877
I...

419
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:55,958
think I'll just give up now.

420
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,104
Aigoo!

421
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:59,287
I've heard that more than a hundred times before.

422
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:00,169
Right?

423
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:02,793
My ears refuse to hear it.

424
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:09,092
But I really mean it this time...

425
00:31:09,092 --> 00:31:10,974
What?!

426
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:13,382
Living together?!

427
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:15,541
Yoon Hae Ra and Beak Seung Jo?!

428
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,211
Didn't you see it wrong or something?

429
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,742
But still,

430
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:24,481
staying at home together for more than one hour and not going out,

431
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:32,306
Wouldn't they be in that kind of relationship. . .

432
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:36,057
Seeing that it became like this,

433
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:39,906
I must have liked Seung Jo very much.

434
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:44,664
I could feel it all the way in my bones.

435
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:50,766
Crushes are really painful...

436
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,082
Ha Ni...

437
00:31:52,082 --> 00:32:18,351
What to do?

438
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:35,996
Hello everyone.

439
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:43,034
1, 2, 3.

440
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,045
Back to the starting position!

441
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:51,037
1, 2, 3.

442
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:52,809
Back to the starting position!

443
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:55,898
1, 2, 3.

444
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:58,008
Hey Oh Ha Ni! Won't you go back to your senses?!

445
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:58,087
Yes.

446
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:47,973
1, 2, 3.

447
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:54,024
Hey! Baek Seung Jo!

448
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:55,952
Who are you?

449
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,915
"Who... Who are you?"

450
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:02,091
We've been around each other for so long, and you're saying you don't know who we are?

451
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:05,079
We are Oh Ha Ni's friends.

452
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:07,322
You have an IQ of 200

453
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:08,855
but you can't even remember that?

454
00:34:08,855 --> 00:34:11,898
We weren't in the same class, but we went to the same high school!

455
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:15,024
I immediately erase useless data out of my head, you know.

456
00:34:15,024 --> 00:34:17,559
Ah, I remember!

457
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,442
The two who have the same level of brains as Oh Ha Ni,

458
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:21,951
Jung Joo Ri and...

459
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:25,225
Go Min Ah, right?

460
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:26,804
What's the matter?

461
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:29,757
Ah really, what did Ha Ni like about a guy like you...

462
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:32,028
You're right.

463
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,864
What did you want to say?

464
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,177
Hey!

465
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:35,326
Don't you think, you were too much?

466
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,601
It's about Ha Ni, do you know?

467
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:41,363
In the last 10 days she looks like she's been through hell and back!

468
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:42,849
As her friend,

469
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,698
I can't just sit and watch her like this!

470
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:46,114
So what?

471
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:47,771
What is it you want to say?

472
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:50,231
Living together!

473
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:52,158
Living together?

474
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:56,033
What? You want to stand here and deny it now?

475
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:59,938
That you are living together with Yoon Hae Ra!

476
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:04,457
Ha Ni said, she followed you two and saw everything with her own eyes!

477
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:06,261
Ha Ni, the poor thing,

478
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:09,423
Waited for more than one hour on the street!

479
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:10,852
Although you know about Ha Ni's feelings,

480
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:12,384
Did you have to leave home like this,

481
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:14,613
and even live with another woman?

482
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,425
At least clear everything up first!

483
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:18,266
You're such a coward.

484
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,117
Don't fool around behind her back!

485
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,114
Be a man and tell her the truth!

486
00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:26,595
Fine. All I have to do is tell her the truth?

487
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:30,798
If you're too honest then it'll be bad for Ha Ni so...

488
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:37,114
She's a lot more sensitive than what she looks to be...

489
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:40,643
So what we're saying is to stop tormenting Ha Ni!

490
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:44,335
We're not telling you to stop liking Yoon Hae Ra.

491
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:45,984
You understand, right?

492
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:49,885
Tell her there's no hope and to give up.

493
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,601
Oh Ha Ni...

494
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:53,816
has been in a one-sided love with you for 4 years.

495
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:58,755
That's what we wanted to say.

496
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:01,464
We'll get going now.

497
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:12,717
Let's go.

498
00:36:12,717 --> 00:36:14,591
Here. You were hungry right?

499
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,354
Wow!

500
00:36:17,354 --> 00:36:18,747
This is abalone.

501
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:20,365
This is mountain root.

502
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:22,076
This is duck.

503
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:26,224
Here Ha Ni eat up, it's a treat from Joon Gu and us.

504
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,323
You have to take care of your body.

505
00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:31,003
And find a new love.

506
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:32,384
That's right, Ha Ni.

507
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,444
Hey, that's not important.

508
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,348
Is he the only man in this world?

509
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:40,992
Look around you, there are so many gorgeous man out there...

510
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:44,939
You're right...

511
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:47,633
But I have no appetite...

512
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,722
You guys eat up.

513
00:36:49,722 --> 00:36:50,837
Hey, Ha Ni...

514
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:52,602
You taking it this hard...

515
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:55,358
Is absolutely killing me.

516
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:04,335
You should eat a little.

517
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:08,398
<i> I haven't seen Seung Jo in two weeks already.

518
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:09,854
<i> Yeah...

519
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,897
<i>Without me trying...

520
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:18,028
<i>There was no way for us to meet like this.

521
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,178
What are you doing here?

522
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:25,435
Are you waiting for someone?

523
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:29,008
Long time no see...

524
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:32,463
I haven't seen you around lately.

525
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,559
Yeah that's right...

526
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,563
Then I'm going to go first.

527
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:40,621
Show some compassion.

528
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:42,989
Can't you sit with me while I wait for someone?

529
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:49,212
Well...I guess.

530
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:53,252
Well... how is it? The new house?

531
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:54,669
Oh...

532
00:37:54,669 --> 00:37:58,063
It's good. The rooms are spacious.

533
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:01,342
Yeah...

534
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:04,212
What about meals?

535
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:05,954
Well,

536
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:09,251
Sometimes I eat at my part-time job.

537
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,619
Sometimes someone cooks for me.

538
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,304
<i> C-cooks for him?

539
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:17,494
When you're suddenly living on your own,

540
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:18,841
it must be quite lonely.

541
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,605
Well, it isn't even like that.

542
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,231
For the most part,

543
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:28,175
I'm with Yoon Hae Ra quite often.

544
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:32,068
Ah... yeah...

545
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:36,479
Teacher!

546
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:39,024
I'm here!

547
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:40,382
You're good about being on time.

548
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:43,082
Coming to Parang University, which is my target...

549
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:46,519
I'm really starting to think that I need to study really hard.

550
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,071
Omo!

551
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:49,328
This unnie...

552
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,256
are you maybe Oh Ha Ni unnie?

553
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:52,719
Ah...

554
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,087
- How do you know me?- I knew it!

555
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:57,659
She's exactly the way teacher Hae Ra described.

556
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,403
I can recognize her instantly. I heard a lot about you.

557
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:02,737
Ah yes...

558
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:04,937
Huh?! What did you hear about me?

559
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:12,103
I heard that you were the bottom of the school, but with the help of teacher Baek Seung Jo that you got into the top 50!

560
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:14,614
I heard that's still a legend!

561
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:17,437
Ah. Well, yes...

562
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:22,603
Teacher!

563
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:23,672
Did you wait long?

564
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:26,737
No, I just came.

565
00:39:26,737 --> 00:39:31,057
I'm getting English tutoring from Hae Ra teacher and math tutoring from Seung Jo teacher,

566
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:34,607
because I'm going to take the entrance exam for this school.

567
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,087
Then your teachers...

568
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:41,603
They come over at least 3 times a week. My mom loves them.

569
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:45,337
She even cooks them meals all the time.

570
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:50,637
But, it seems like Hae Ra teacher and Ha Ni unnie are not that close.

571
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:52,995
Then....

572
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:59,103
the place you went in with Hae Ra... You weren't living together, right?

573
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:00,903
Live together?!

574
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:03,503
Making conclusions on your own basis...

575
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:08,637
It's a good part-time job because it takes care of dinner.

576
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:09,637
Let's go now.

577
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:51,803
Then, good-bye.

578
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:55,137
You were making chocolate??

579
00:40:55,137 --> 00:41:00,203
You give chocolate to special people...

580
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:03,003
You... perhaps...

581
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,645
Oh my goodness!

582
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:08,047
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?

583
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:09,737
It took too long, right?

584
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:12,903
It's seems like you came back to your own self now.

585
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:18,087
I was so worried because you kept looking so lifeless these last few days.

586
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:21,027
This time you really need to make things work.

587
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:21,906
Yes.

588
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:22,503
Fighting!

589
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:36,087
Fighting!

590
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:41,603
I just can't get it to taste right.

591
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:49,637
Although the taste is not that important ...

592
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,015
What's wrong...

593
00:41:52,015 --> 00:42:25,039
Is it because I haven't been eating well for the past few days?

594
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,742
Did you make it?

595
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,297
It looks beautiful.

596
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:42,023
It must be delicious.

597
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:49,157
Should I put it on your finger?

598
00:42:49,157 --> 00:43:06,066
Seung Jo...

599
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:09,423
It's even raining on a day like this

600
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:36,023
and I didn't bring my umbrella.

601
00:43:36,023 --> 00:43:37,957
Ahjusshi what's wrong?

602
00:43:37,957 --> 00:43:41,188
What to do? The car seems to be broken.

603
00:43:41,188 --> 00:44:05,453
What?

604
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:07,423
Oh, Ha Ni came.

605
00:44:07,423 --> 00:44:11,723
Seung Jo... I came.

606
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:14,098
On a day when it's raining this hard!

607
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:24,823
You're really an amazing person.

608
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:28,223
There's no use in waiting until Seung Jo has finished.

609
00:44:28,223 --> 00:44:32,557
It seems things just get worse for you. Today we tutor Ji Yeon.

610
00:44:32,557 --> 00:44:52,223
Ah, it's coffee, right? A lot of it?

611
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,757
<i> When will I be able to give this to him?

612
00:44:54,757 --> 00:45:30,057
<i> Here is a little... And anyhow, Hae Ra is here too.

613
00:45:30,057 --> 00:45:32,066
What's with that face?

614
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,921
What's wrong with my face?

615
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:36,591
You don't look good.

616
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,191
You should get back home immediately.

617
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:57,366
I'm fine.

618
00:45:57,366 --> 00:45:58,823
Customer?

619
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,423
Ha Ni?Ha Ni?

620
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:01,523
Oh Ha Ni?

621
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:03,059
Ha Ni?

622
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,723
Oh Ha Ni?!

623
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:15,357
Hey!

624
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:20,123
Are you alright?

625
00:46:20,123 --> 00:46:22,123
I'm sorry.

626
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:23,123
Causing trouble.

627
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:25,523
Will you be okay without calling an ambulance?

628
00:46:25,523 --> 00:46:29,059
Seung Jo Shi already gave you first aid.

629
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:33,057
That's okay. I'm better now.

630
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:36,069
Baek Seung Jo shi, is this a person you know?

631
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:37,009
Yes.

632
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:40,009
Is it? Then both of you should get back home.

633
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:42,039
You should give this young lady a ride home.

634
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:45,019
Ah, no. I'm really fine.

635
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:48,301
How can you leave by yourself with this situation?

636
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:50,157
Do as I say Seung Jo shi.

637
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:52,757
Yes. I got it.

638
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:55,557
It seems that you'll leave alone.

639
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:58,039
I understand. There is nothing I can do about it.

640
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:05,049
Getting bumped around by little Miss Trouble everyday, it must be painful.

641
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:08,009
Oh Ha Ni!

642
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:10,323
You are amazing.

643
00:47:10,323 --> 00:47:12,157
Anyway take care of yourself.

644
00:47:12,157 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm going.I'm going.

645
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,757
There aren't many cars around here.

646
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:42,857
I think it would be hard to find a cab here.

647
00:47:42,857 --> 00:47:46,523
Seung Jo, you're getting wet. Come closer.

648
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:53,623
Don't go whining about being sick after getting wet so you can just get closer.

649
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:55,923
Seung Jo...

650
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:59,069
I'll just walk over to the station so you just go in.

651
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:02,223
It's a 30 minute walk to the station.

652
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:06,223
And with rain this harsh...

653
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:09,657
The trains might come to a halt like last time.

654
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:16,023
My apartment is 10 min away from here... You wanna come?

655
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:20,423
In my room, you can call mother and

656
00:48:20,423 --> 00:49:13,723
tell her to come here by car.

657
00:49:13,723 --> 00:49:17,823
Wow! It looks better than I expected.

658
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:24,557
What you even have a full kitchen?!

659
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:28,357
Here is...

660
00:49:28,357 --> 00:49:53,223
The bathroom.

661
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:57,019
Hae Ra... came here too?

662
00:49:57,019 --> 00:50:02,019
Here?

663
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:09,657
You're the first to come over.

664
00:50:09,657 --> 00:50:11,723
How are you doing?

665
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:14,757
Now I'm okay.

666
00:50:14,757 --> 00:50:18,029
That's what you get for drinking that much coffee on an empty stomach!

667
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:20,099
It would be amazing if you didn't get a stomachache.

668
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:25,089
I said I'm alright now.

669
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:34,023
Here, a towel.

670
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:36,457
Baek Seung Jo's smell.

671
00:50:36,457 --> 00:50:39,192
What smell? it's brand new.

672
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:44,099
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

673
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,049
Hello?

674
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:49,156
It's me, Seung Jo.

675
00:50:49,156 --> 00:50:51,323
I'm at my home

676
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:55,023
Pardon?

677
00:50:55,023 --> 00:50:56,957
I met her.

678
00:50:56,957 --> 00:50:59,557
She came by my part time job.

679
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:03,523
She fainted after she drank a cup of coffee.

680
00:51:03,523 --> 00:51:09,257
No, she seems fine right now.

681
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:15,557
<i> The time for us being alone like this, will be over once Mother comes to pick me up.

682
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:18,423
<i> Before that, I have to get a look at Seung Jo's bedroom.

683
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:19,623
We are together now.

684
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:22,623
Omo! Really?!We couldn't find a cab,

685
00:51:22,623 --> 00:51:27,223
therefore please come here to pick her up.

686
00:51:27,223 --> 00:51:28,099
Pardon?

687
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:30,049
Pardon?!

688
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:33,457
Are you joking now?

689
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,523
Mom?

690
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:35,089
Mom?!

691
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,357
Hello...?

692
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,157
Ah what?! Hanging up like that.

693
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:41,657
Why?

694
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:42,757
What did she say?

695
00:51:42,757 --> 00:51:46,423
She doesn't want to come because it's raining too much.

696
00:51:46,423 --> 00:51:47,123
Huh?

697
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:51,423
She will pick us up tomorrow, so we have to stay here for the night.

698
00:51:51,423 --> 00:52:09,009
That's what she said.

699
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:15,123
<i>He's taking a shower, and from now on it will only be the 2 of us all night long.

700
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:16,069
<i>Ah...

701
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:21,823
<i>A situation that only arises in romance novels!

702
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:25,557
<i> What should I do?

703
00:52:25,557 --> 00:52:32,923
<i> This happened before at Seung Jo's parents' house, but the situation is different now.

704
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:52,453
<i>In this house, there is only the two of us!

705
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:55,012
<i> There's also only one bed!

706
00:52:55,012 --> 00:52:56,287
Hey!

707
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:56,078
Yes?

708
00:52:56,078 --> 00:52:58,082
Are you going to take a shower?

709
00:52:58,082 --> 00:53:01,887
Sh-shower?

710
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,854
Ah, yeah, then... I'll take a shower.

711
00:53:05,854 --> 00:53:07,887
Are you nervous?

712
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:10,029
Nervous? No way.

713
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:13,353
Not at all.

714
00:53:13,353 --> 00:53:15,125
Put that on.

715
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,387
There's only my clothes.

716
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:21,092
If you don't like it then forget it.

717
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:32,687
Thank you.

718
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:35,389
<i>I like this feeling of having my heart flutter like this.

719
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:41,177
<i>This spot where Seung Jo was just at...Now I'm here.

720
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:46,062
<i>Is Seung Jo waiting for me outside?

721
00:53:46,062 --> 00:54:07,587
<i>Tonight seems like a night that people only experience once in their lifetime.

722
00:54:07,587 --> 00:54:09,087
Joong Gu, answer the phone!

723
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:15,898
Ah, yes. I understand.

724
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:17,753
Hello, this is So Pal Bok Noodles.

725
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:20,002
I'm calling from Seung Jo's house.

726
00:54:20,002 --> 00:54:21,387
I'd like to speak to Ha Ni's father.

727
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:24,464
Ah, you are Baek Seung Jo's mother?

728
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:29,787
Oh my, then who would you be?

729
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:30,519
Joong Goo-goon?

730
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:32,153
Oh yes it's Bong Joon Gu.

731
00:54:32,153 --> 00:54:36,354
But our chef is extremely busy right now.

732
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:42,992
Then listen carefully Joon Gu, and please make sure to tell Ha Ni's father.

733
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:44,753
Yes I got it. Please tell me.

734
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:48,353
Ha Ni will be spending the night away from home tonight.

735
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:50,287
That he need not to worry.

736
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,387
She's going to sleep over at Seung Jo's house.

737
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:54,287
What?

738
00:54:54,287 --> 00:55:00,353
I just thought it was better for her to stay there than to come home during these windy rains.

739
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:01,453
What...

740
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:04,022
What...What did you say?

741
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:06,002
Are you serious lady?!

742
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:11,831
H-ha Ni is going to sleep over at Seung Jo's home?!

743
00:55:11,831 --> 00:55:13,587
Where is Baek Seung Jo now?

744
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:17,553
Omo, what to do... I don't know that.

745
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:20,905
But although I know it, I'm not gonna tell you~

746
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:21,887
What?!

747
00:55:21,887 --> 00:55:24,008
Well then, I'm gonna hang up~

748
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:25,042
Excuse me, hello--

749
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:27,022
Ahjumma, don't hang up! Don't hang up!

750
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:28,932
What's the matter?

751
00:55:28,932 --> 00:55:32,487
Ch-chef! Do you know where that Baek Seung Jo lives?

752
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:35,087
How in the world would I know where Seung Jo lives!?

753
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:39,787
I only know that he's working at that family restaurant.

754
00:55:39,787 --> 00:55:42,387
What's the name of the family restaurant?

755
00:55:42,387 --> 00:55:46,082
I think they're selling Dak (Korean for "chicken") there, ah no, it was chicken, or something like that.

756
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:50,365
Is it Dak or Chicken?

757
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:52,053
I'm leaving first!

758
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,853
Hey!

759
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:55,229
Hey!

760
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:56,012
Baek Seung Jo!

761
00:55:56,012 --> 00:56:07,834
Hey you! Joon Gu!

762
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,077
I...

763
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,253
I enjoyed the shower.

764
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:13,757
Thank you.

765
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:16,092
Yeah.

766
00:56:16,092 --> 00:56:18,004
<i> So...

767
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:33,987
<i> What are we gonna do from now on?

768
00:56:33,987 --> 00:56:36,557
Who are you?

769
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:39,553
Hello?

770
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:42,687
Hello?

771
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:45,092
I wanted... to ask something...

772
00:56:45,092 --> 00:56:48,453
At this restaurant...

773
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:50,753
is there a guy called Seung Jo...

774
00:56:50,753 --> 00:56:54,386
Seung Jo? Baek Seung Jo?

775
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:56,252
I must find...

776
00:56:56,252 --> 00:56:58,309
I must find...

777
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:59,253
Hello?

778
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,887
Sir? Hello?

779
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:18,553
Excuse me!

780
00:57:18,553 --> 00:57:23,685
I'm going to go to sleep.

781
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:26,032
Huh?

782
00:57:26,032 --> 00:57:30,187
Yeah, it's already 12 o'clock...

783
00:57:30,187 --> 00:57:34,153
Well then I will sleep on the floor,

784
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:37,387
so you just sleep in the bed.

785
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,353
Of course.

786
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:42,487
What?

787
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:44,062
There's only one blanket.

788
00:57:44,062 --> 00:57:46,092
if you're cold, go to the closet

789
00:57:46,092 --> 00:57:50,553
Pull out a coat of mine and go to sleep if you must.

790
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:55,353
Hey, usually in situations like this, you should say to the girl

791
00:57:55,353 --> 00:58:00,072
"Hey, what are you saying, I'll sleep on the floor, so you can sleep in the bed."

792
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:02,287
Isn't that common sense?

793
00:58:02,287 --> 00:58:06,187
I don't want to say something like that to you.

794
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:08,187
What did you say to a sick person?!

795
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:09,953
You're not even a human!

796
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,653
You crazy cold human!

797
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:31,062
What?

798
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:37,016
Hey...

799
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:39,087
Hey...

800
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:41,587
What is it?

801
00:58:41,587 --> 00:58:44,687
I hate the dark...

802
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,301
Can't we turn the lights on?

803
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:50,188
I can't sleep if it's not dark.

804
00:58:50,188 --> 00:58:56,092
A ghost could come out...

805
00:58:56,092 --> 00:58:59,801
Hey...

806
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:02,262
What now?

807
00:59:02,262 --> 00:59:04,043
Aren't you cold?

808
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:06,095
Of course I'm cold.

809
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:08,653
Even my back is cold.

810
00:59:08,653 --> 00:59:11,087
I'll just sleep on the floor.

811
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:13,887
It's fine, so just go to sleep!

812
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:16,653
But still...

813
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:17,953
But it's cold...

814
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:20,553
Okay! I can sleep here too, right?

815
00:59:20,553 --> 00:59:23,418
Wait! Then... I'll sleep on the floor...

816
00:59:23,418 --> 00:59:24,887
It's fine!

817
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:30,287
If I do this, then you'll quiet down too!

818
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:50,453
Sleep!

819
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:53,287
Are you nervous?

820
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:57,109
Why do you keep asking that! Nervous? Whatever.

821
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:59,089
I'm not.

822
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:02,287
Then what's that sound of you swallowing your spit?

823
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:03,241
Huh?

824
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:06,674
You're spending a night with me.

825
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:09,872
You never know if something could happen.

826
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,753
Like a kiss?

827
01:00:12,753 --> 01:00:14,098
Or...

828
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:29,058
Something beyond that could happen.

829
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,587
You may look forward to it...

830
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:32,553
Sorry.

831
01:00:32,553 --> 01:00:35,487
But I'm not going to do anything.

832
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:39,787
Sleep well.

833
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:48,653
Good night.

834
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:52,253
<i> It's like it all died down,

835
01:00:52,253 --> 01:00:55,053
<i> but I think I feel relieved.

836
01:00:55,053 --> 01:00:59,052
<i>But still, to not do anything while on a bed with a girl,</i>

837
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:05,253
<i>I wonder if Seung Jo feels numb towards women or something.</i>

838
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:12,586
<i>Maybe it's just because he doesn't see me as an attractive girl.</i>

839
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:15,287
<i>That's it!</i>

840
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:17,252
<i>There's no way a girl like me...</i>

841
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:20,195
Are you blaming yourself?

842
01:01:20,195 --> 01:01:22,505
Blaming myself?

843
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:23,895
No...

844
01:01:23,895 --> 01:01:25,295
I...

845
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:31,928
Don't want to become what my mother thinks of me as.

846
01:01:31,928 --> 01:01:35,795
Say something did happen between us tonight.

847
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:38,166
We'll totally be caught up in it.

848
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:44,495
Then we'll forever be controlled by my mother.

849
01:01:44,495 --> 01:01:46,562
That's all.

850
01:01:46,562 --> 01:01:49,262
So...

851
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:57,562
So don't expect anything and just go to sleep.

852
01:01:57,562 --> 01:02:02,795
<i>That's right, he said he didn't dislike me.

853
01:02:02,795 --> 01:02:07,007
<i>For some reason I feel warm and happy.

854
01:02:07,007 --> 01:02:11,695
<i>Being able to sleep next to Seung Jo...

855
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:58,422
<i>It's so precious I can't fall asleep.

856

857
01:04:03,502 --> 01:04:04,462
Baek Seung Jo!

858
01:04:04,462 --> 01:04:05,995
Yoon Hae Ra!

859
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:10,528
One two!

860
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:12,795
It's fun.

861
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,547
Go on.

862
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:15,828
Alright.

863
01:04:15,828 --> 99:59:59,999
One more match.

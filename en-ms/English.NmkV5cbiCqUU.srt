00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,189
We started Universal Subtitles because we believe

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,700
every video on the web should be subtitle-able.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,171
Millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers require subtitles to access video.

4
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:15,406
Videomakers and websites should really care about this stuff too.

5
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:20,752
Subtitles give them access to a wider audience and they also get better search rankings.

6
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:26,936
Universal Subtitles makes it incredibly easy to add subtitles to almost any video.

7
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:32,440
Take an existing video on the web, submit the URL to our website

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,298
and then type along with the dialog to create the subtitles.

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,650
After that, tap on your keyboard to sync them with the video.

10
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:49,607
Then you're doneâ€” we give you an embed code for the video that you can put on any website

11
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:55,683
at that point, viewers are able to use the subtitles and can also contribute to translations.

12
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:01,546
We support videos on YouTube, Blip.TV, Ustream, and many more.

13
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:05,109
Plus we're adding more services all the time

14
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,050
Universal Subtitles works with many popular video formats,

15
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,305
such as MP4, theora, webM and over HTML 5.

16
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:18,045
Our goal is for every video on the web to be subtitle-able

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,311
so that anyone who cares about the video can help make it more accessible.

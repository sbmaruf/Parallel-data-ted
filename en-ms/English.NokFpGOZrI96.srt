1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,500
There are two whole Khan
Academy videos on what

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,320
scientific notation is, why
we even worry about it.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,800
And it also goes through
a few examples.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,770
And what I want to do in this
video is just use a ck12.org

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,960
Algebra I book to do some more
scientific notation examples.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,460
So let's take some things
that are written

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,690
in scientific notation.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,980
Just as a reminder, scientific
notation is useful because it

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,180
allows us to write really
large, or really small

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,220
numbers, in ways that are easy
for our brains to, one, write

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,120
down, and two, understand.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
So let's write down
some numbers.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,900
So let's say I have 3.102
times 10 to the second.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,510
And I want to write it as
just a numerical value.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,720
It's in scientific
notation already.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,840
It's written as a product
with a power of 10.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,310
So how do I write this?

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,750
It's just a numeral.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,520
Well, there's a slow way
and the fast way.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,410
The slow way is to say, well,
this is the same thing as

21
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:09,540
3.102 times 100, which means if
you multiplied 3.102 times

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,040
100, it'll be 3, 1, 0, 2,
with two 0's behind it.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,670
And then we have 1, 2, 3 numbers
behind the decimal

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:25,260
point, and that'd be
the right answer.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,230
This is equal to 310.2.

26
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,570
Now, a faster way to do this
is just to say, well, look,

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,510
right now I have only the 3 in
front of the decimal point.

28
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,180
When I take something times 10
to the second power, I'm

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,070
essentially shifting the decimal
point 2 to the right.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,400
So 3.102 times 10 to the second
power is the same thing

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,260
as-- if I shift the decimal
point 1, and then 2, because

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,920
this is 10 to the second
power-- it's

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,090
same thing as 310.2.

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,920
So this might be a faster
way of doing it.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,490
Every time you multiply it by
10, you shift the decimal to

36
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,840
the right by 1.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,920
Let's do another example.

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,909
Let's say I had 7.4 times
10 to the fourth.

39
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,030
Well, let's just do
this the fast way.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,560
Let's shift the decimal
4 to the right.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,560
So 7.4 times 10 to the fourth.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Times 10 to the 1, you're
going to get 74.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,050
Then times 10 to the second,
you're going to get 740.

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,080
We're going to have to add a
0 there, because we have to

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,500
shift the decimal again.

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,710
10 to the third, you're
going to have 7,400.

47
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,390
And then 10 to the fourth,
you're going to have 74,000.

48
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,830
Notice, I just took
this decimal and

49
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:49,235
went 1, 2, 3, 4 spaces.

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,130
So this is equal to 74,000.

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,410
And when I had 74, and I had to
shift the decimal 1 more to

52
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,920
the right, I had to
throw in a 0 here.

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,820
I'm multiplying it by 10.

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,760
Another way to think about it
is, I need 10 spaces between

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,420
the leading digit
and the decimal.

56
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,250
So right here, I only
have 1 space.

57
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,820
I'll need 4 spaces,
So, 1, 2, 3, 4.

58
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,670
Let's do a few more examples,
because I think the more

59
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,230
examples, the more you'll
get what's going on.

60
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,590
So I have 1.75 times 10
to the negative 3.

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,050
This is in scientific notation,
and I want to just

62
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,800
write the numerical
value of this.

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,360
So when you take something to
the negative times 10 to the

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,250
negative power, you shift
the decimal to the left.

65
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,130
So this is 1.75.

66
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,550
So if you do it times 10 to the
negative 1 power, you'll

67
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,330
go 1 to the left.

68
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,940
But if you do times 10 to the
negative 2 power, you'll go 2

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,570
to the left.

70
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,130
And you'd have to
put a 0 here.

71
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,670
And if you do times 10 to the
negative 3, you'd go 3 to the

72
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,160
left, and you would have
to add another 0.

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,860
So you take this decimal and
go 1, 2, 3 to the left.

74
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,440
So our answer would be 0.00175
is the same thing as 1.75

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,560
times 10 to the negative 3.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,520
And another way to check that
you got the right answer is if

77
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,869
you have a 1 right here, if you
count the 1, 1 including

78
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,310
the 0's to the right of the
decimal should be the same as

79
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,880
the negative exponent here.

80
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,150
So you have 1, 2, 3 numbers
behind the decimal.

81
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,520
That's the same thing as to
the negative 3 power.

82
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,030
You're doing 1,000th, so this
is 1,000th right there.

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,330
Let's do another example.

84
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,230
Actually let's mix it up.

85
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,710
Let's start with something
that's written as a numeral

86
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,250
and then write it in scientific
notation.

87
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,860
So let's say I have 120,000.

88
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,430
So that's just its numerical
value, and I want to write it

89
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,270
in scientific notation.

90
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,490
So this I can write as-- I take
the leading digit-- 1.2

91
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,910
times 10 to the-- and I just
count how many digits there

92
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,680
are behind the leading digit.

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,270
So 1.2 times 10 to the fifth.

95
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,650
And if you want to internalize
why that makes sense, 10 to

96
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,950
the fifth is 10,000.

97
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,390
So 1.2-- 10 to the
fifth is 100,000.

98
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,970
So it's 1.2 times--
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

99
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,900
You have five 0's.

100
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,580
That's 10 to the fifth.

101
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,230
So 1.2 times 100,000 is
going to be a 120,000.

102
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,890
It's going to be 1 and 1/5
times 100,000, so 120.

103
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,400
So hopefully that's
sinking in.

104
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,030
So let's do another one.

105
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:49,840
Let's say the numerical
value is 1,765,244.

106
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,150
I want to write this in
scientific notation, so I take

107
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,430
the leading digit, 1,
put a decimal sign.

108
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,050
Everything else goes
behind the decimal.

109
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,530
7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 4.

110
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,460
And then you count how many
digits there were between the

111
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,920
leading digit, and I guess, you
could imagine, the first

112
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,640
decimal sign.

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,720
Because you could have numbers
that keep going over here.

114
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,370
So between the leading digit
and the decimal sign.

115
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,080
And you have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 digits.

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,310
So this is times 10
to the sixth.

117
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,620
And 10 to the sixth
is just 1 million.

118
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,200
So it's 1.765244 times 1
million, which makes sense.

119
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,750
Roughly 1.7 times million
is roughly 1.7 million.

120
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,260
This is a little bit
more than 1.7

121
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,970
million, so it makes sense.

122
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,360
Let's do another one.

123
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,730
How do I write 12 in scientific
notation?

124
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,120
Same drill.

125
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,430
It's equal to 1.2 times-- well,
we only have 1 digit

126
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,880
between the 1 and the decimal
spot, or the decimal point.

127
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:54,905
So it's 1.2 times 10 to the
first power, or 1.2 times 10,

128
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,540
which is definitely
equal to 12.

129
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,230
Let's do a couple of examples
where we're taking 10 to a

130
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,530
negative power.

131
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,480
So let's say we had 0.00281, and
we want to write this in

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,450
scientific notation.

133
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,850
So what you do, is you just have
to think, well, how many

134
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,010
digits are there to include
the leading

135
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,370
numeral in the value?

136
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:26,755
So what I mean there
is count, 1, 2, 3.

137
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,980
So what we want to
do is we move the

138
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,040
decimal 1, 2, 3 spaces.

139
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,710
So one way you could think about
it is, you can multiply.

140
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,220
To move the decimal to the
right 3 spaces, you would

141
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,200
multiply it by 10
to the third.

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,170
But if you're multiplying
something by 10 to the third,

143
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,340
you're changing its values.

144
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,440
So we also have to multiply
by 10 to the negative 3.

145
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,090
Only this way will you not
change the value, right?

146
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,920
If I multiply by 10 to the 3,
times 10 to the negative 2-- 3

147
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,440
minus 3 is 0-- this is just
like multiplying it by 1.

148
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,820
So what is this going
to equal?

149
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,420
If I take the decimal and I move
it 3 spaces to the right,

150
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,510
this part right here is going
to be equal to 2.81.

151
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,880
And then we're left with
this one, times 10 to

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,720
the negative 3.

153
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,770
Now, a very quick way to do it
is just to say, look, let me

154
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,860
count-- including the leading
numeral-- how many spaces I

155
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,970
have behind the decimal.

156
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,440
1, 2, 3.

157
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,060
So it's going to be 2.81
times 10 to the

158
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,430
negative 1, 2, 3 power.

159
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,470
Let's do one more like that.

160
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,080
Let me actually scroll
up here.

161
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,520
Let's do one more like that.

162
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:43,240
Let's say I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6-- how many 0's do I have

163
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,750
in this problem?

164
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,030
Well, I'll just make
up something.

165
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,240
0, 2, 7.

166
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,830
And you wanted to write that
in scientific notation.

167
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,540
Well, you count all the
digits up to the

168
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,380
2, behind the decimal.

169
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,610
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

170
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,870
So this is going to
be 2.7 times 10 to

171
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,460
the negative 8 power.

172
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,270
Now let's do another one,
where we start with the

173
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,840
scientific notation value
and we want to go

174
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,760
to the numeric value.

175
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,690
Just to mix things up.

176
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,190
So let's say you have
2.9 times 10 to

177
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,830
the negative fifth.

178
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,360
So one way to think about is,
this leading numeral, plus all

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,110
0's to the left of the
decimal spot, is

180
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,980
going to be five digits.

181
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,600
So you have a 2 and a 9,
and then you're going

182
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,170
to have 4 more 0's.

183
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,450
1, 2, 3, 4.

184
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,140
And then you're going to
have your decimal.

185
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,610
And how did I know 4 0's?

186
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,370
Because I'm counting,, this is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces behind

187
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,510
the decimal, including
the leading numeral.

188
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,600
And so it's 0.000029.

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,670
And just to verify, do
the other technique.

190
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,110
How do I write this in
scientific notation?

191
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,310
I count all of the digits, all
of the leading 0's behind the

192
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,050
decimal, including the leading
non-zero numeral.

193
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,330
So I have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 digits.

194
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,730
So it's 10 to the negative 5.

195
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:20,595
And so it'll be 2.9 times
10 to the negative 5.

196
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,230
And once again, this isn't
just some type

197
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,450
of black magic here.

198
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,270
This actually makes
a lot of sense.

199
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,920
If I wanted to get this number
to 2.9, what I would have to

200
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,310
do is move the decimal over 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 spots, like that.

201
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,010
And to get the decimal to move
over the right by 5 spots--

202
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,700
let's just say with
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9.

203
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,670
If I multiply it by 10 to the
fifth, I'm also going to have

204
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,700
to multiply it by 10
to the negative 5.

205
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,230
So I don't want to change
the number.

206
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,060
This right here is just
multiplying something by 1.

207
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,790
10 to the fifth times 10
to the negative 5 is 1.

208
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,910
So this right here is
essentially going to move the

209
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,850
decimal 5 to the right.

210
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

211
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,660
So this will be 2.5, and then
we're going to be left with

212
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,310
times 10 to the negative 5.

213
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,640
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that scientific

214
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,980
notation drill useful.

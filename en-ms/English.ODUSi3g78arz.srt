1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My travels to Afghanistan

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
began many, many years ago

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
on the eastern border of my country,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
my homeland, Poland.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was walking through the forests

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of my grandmother's tales.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A land where every field hides a grave,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
where millions of people

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
have been deported or killed

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in the 20th century.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Behind the destruction,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I found a soul of places.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I met humble people.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I heard their prayer

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and ate their bread.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then I have been walking East for 20 years --

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
from Eastern Europe to Central Asia --

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
through the Caucasus Mountains,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Middle East,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
North Africa,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Russia.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I ever met more humble people.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I shared their bread and their prayer.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is why I went to Afghanistan.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One day, I crossed the bridge

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
over the Oxus River.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was alone on foot.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that he forgot to stamp my passport.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But he gave me a cup of tea.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And I understood

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that his surprise was my protection.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I have been walking and traveling,

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
from Iran's border

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And in this way

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My only weapon

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
was my notebook and my Leica.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I heard prayers of the Sufi --

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
humble Muslims,

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
hated by the Taliban.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hidden river,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
interconnected with the mysticism

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
from Gibraltar to India.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The mosque where the respectful foreigner

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
is showered with blessings

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and with tears,

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and welcomed as a gift.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What do we know

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
about the country and the people

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that we pretend to protect,

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
about the villages

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
where the only one medicine

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to kill the pain and to stop the hunger

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is opium?

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
These are opium-addicted people

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
on the roofs of Kabul

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
10 years after the beginning of our war.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
These are the nomad girls

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What do we know about the women

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
10 years after the war?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Clothed in this nylon bag,

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
made in China,

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
with the name of burqa.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I saw one day,

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the largest school in Afghanistan,

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
a girls' school.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
13,000 girls

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
studying here

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
in the rooms underground,

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
full of scorpions.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And their love [for studying]

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
was so big that I cried.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What do we know

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
about the death threats by the Taliban

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
nailed on the doors

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban,

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and they did it.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My aim is to give a voice

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to the silent people,

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to show the hidden lights

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
behind the curtain of the great game,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the small worlds ignored by the media

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and the prophets of a global conflict.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thanks.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(Applause)

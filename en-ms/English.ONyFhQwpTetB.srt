1
00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:05,038
Regina rode her bike 2 and 1/4
miles from her house to school

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,604
and then 1 and 5/8 miles
to her friend's house.

3
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:11,454
How many miles did Regina
ride in total?

4
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:17,388
So she first rode 2 and 1/4
miles, and then she

5
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:20,454
rode 1 and 5/8 miles.

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,071
then she rode 1 and 5/8 miles

7
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,772
So the sum is the total number
of miles she rode.

8
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:30,972
So to take this sum, we've seen
that we can add the whole

9
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,039
number parts, because this is
really the same thing as 2

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,554
plus 1/4 plus 1 plus 5/8, so we
can just switch the order,

11
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,154
if you want to view
it that way.

12
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:42,572
So we can add the 2 plus the 1
first, and then we get-- let

13
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:43,489
me do that here.

14
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,854
So 2 plus the 1, you get 3, and
then we need to add the

15
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:48,705
1/4 plus 5/8.

16
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:57,189
And to add these two fractions,
we have to find the

17
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,972
least common multiple
of 4 and 8.

18
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:01,655
That'll be our new
denominator.

19
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:10,888
8 is divisible by both 8 and 4,
so that is the least common

20
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:19,038
multiple of 4 and 8, so our
common denominator will be 8.

21
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,372
Obviously, 5/8 will
still be 5/8.

22
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,154
Now to go from a denominator
of 4 to 8, you have to

23
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,572
multiply the denominator by 2,
so we also need to multiply

24
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:30,488
the numerator by 2,
so 1 times 2 is 2.

25
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:32,871
And, of course, we still
have this 3 out there.

26
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:36,788
So 2 and 1/4 plus 1 and 5/8 is
the same thing as this right

27
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:41,738
here, and this is equal to-- we
have our 3 plus, and then

28
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:50,221
over 8 we add the 2 plus 5.

29
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,590
We have 7/8.

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,188
So this is going to be equal
to 3 and 7/8 miles.

31
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:58,355
She rode a total of
3 and 7/8 miles.

32
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,506
Now, I want to make one
thing very clear.

33
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,755
So far when we've been adding
these mixed numbers, the

34
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,604
fraction part always ended
up as a proper fraction.

35
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:07,739
The numerator was smaller
than the denominator.

36
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,655
But I want to do a quick example
to show you what you

37
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,221
do when the numerator is not
smaller than the denominator.

38
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:24,604
So let's say we had 1 and
5/8 plus 2 and 4/8.

39
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,289
So if you add just the
whole number parts, 1

40
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,772
plus 2, you get 3.

41
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:35,871
Plus 5/8 plus 4/8, 5/8
plus 4/8 is 9/8, so

42
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,422
you get 3 plus 9/8.

43
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,555
Now it would be really strange
to just say, OK, that's the

44
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:43,271
same thing as 3 and 9/8, because
you have a mixed

45
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,855
number with a whole number
and an improper fraction.

46
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,522
If you're going through the
trouble of making it a mixed

47
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:50,604
number, the fraction better
be a proper fraction.

48
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,239
So what you need to do is
rewrite 9/8, and you know that

49
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,521
9/8 is the same thing
as 1 and 1/8, right?

50
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:04,621
8 goes into 9 one time with 1
left over, so it's 1 and 1/8.

51
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:08,639
So this is the same thing
as 3 plus 1 and 1/8.

52
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,439
So now we can add the
whole number parts.

53
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,422
3 plus 1 is equal to 4, and then
you have your 1/8 over

54
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,554
there: 4 and 1/8.

55
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:18,805
I just wanted to give you that
special circumstance when your

56
00:03:18,805 --> 99:59:59,000
fraction part ends
up improper.

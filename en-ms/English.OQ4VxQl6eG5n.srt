00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,830
A recipe for banana oat muffins
calls for 3/4 of a cup

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,820
of old-fashioned oats.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,740
You are making 1/2
of the recipe.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,230
How much oats should you use?

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,550
So if the whole recipe requires
3/4 of a cup and

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,630
you're making half of
the recipe, you want

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,520
half of 3/4, right?

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,100
You want half of the number of
old-fashioned oats as the

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,330
whole recipe.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,440
So you want 1/2 of 3/4.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,860
So you just multiply 1/2 times
3/4, and this is equal to--

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,550
you multiply the numerators.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,590
1 times 3 is 3.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,960
2 times 4 is 8.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,820
And we're done!

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:51,885
You need 3/8 of a cup of
old-fashioned oats.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,220
And let's visualize that a
little bit, just so it makes a

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,040
little bit more sense.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,560
Let me draw what 3/4 looks like,
or essentially how much

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,400
oats you would need in a normal
situation, or if you're

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,060
doing the whole recipe.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,950
So let me draw.

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,270
Let's say this represents a
whole cup, and if we put it

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,040
into fourths-- let me divide
it a little bit better.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,690
So if we put it into fourths,
3/4 would represent three of

26
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,290
these, so it would represent
one, two, three.

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,740
It would represent
that many oats.

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,240
Now, you want half
of this, right?

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,110
Because you're going to make
half of the recipe.

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,320
So we can just split
this in half.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,700
Let me do this with
a new color.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,600
So you would normally use this
orange amount of oats, but

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,270
we're going to do half the
recipe, so you'd want

34
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,645
half as many oats.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,930
So you would want
this many oats.

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,790
Now, let's think about
what that is

37
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,190
relative to a whole cup.

38
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,520
Well, one way we can do it is
to turn each of these four

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,360
buckets, or these four pieces,
or these four sections of a

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,630
cup into eight sections
of a cup.

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's see what happens
when we do that.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,260
So we're essentially turning
each piece, each fourth, into

43
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,530
two pieces.

44
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,510
So let's divide each
of them into two.

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,340
So this is the first piece.

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,810
We're going to divide it into
two right there, so now it is

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,250
two pieces.

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,300
And then this is the second
piece right here.

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,390
We divide it into one piece
and then two pieces.

50
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,980
This is the third piece, so
we divide it into one, two

51
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,805
pieces, and this is the fourth
piece, or the fourth section,

52
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,950
and we divide it into
two sections.

53
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,490
Now, what is this as a fraction
of the whole?

54
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,840
Well, we have eight
pieces now, right?

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,810
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, because we

56
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,380
turned each of the four, we
split them again into eight,

57
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,650
so we have 8 as the denominator,
and we took half

58
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,980
of the 3/4, right?

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,430
Remember, 3/4 was in orange.

60
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,170
Let me make this very
clear because this

61
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,110
drawing can get confusing.

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,280
This was 3/4 right there.

63
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,090
So that is 3/4.

64
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:19,620
This area in this purple color
is 1/2 of the 3/4.

65
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,020
But let's think about it
in terms of the eights.

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,180
How many of these sections
of eight is it?

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,910
Well, you have one section of
eight here, two sections of

68
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,820
eight there, three sections
of eight, so it is 3/8.

69
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,460
So hopefully that makes some
sense or gives you a more

70
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,260
tangible feel for what
it means when

71
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,800
you take 1/2 of 3/4.

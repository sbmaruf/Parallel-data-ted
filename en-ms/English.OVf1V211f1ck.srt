Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,037
Alice was beginning to get very tired ofsitting by her sister on the bank, and of

3
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:19,094
having nothing to do: once or twice she hadpeeped into the book her sister was

4
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:22,062
reading, but it had no pictures or

5
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:27,057
conversations in it, 'and what is the useof a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures

6
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:30,046
or conversation?'

7
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:34,099
So she was considering in her own mind (aswell as she could, for the hot day made her

8
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:39,078
feel very sleepy and stupid), whether thepleasure of making a daisy-chain would be

9
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:41,076
worth the trouble of getting up and picking

10
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:48,679
the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbitwith pink eyes ran close by her.

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,199
There was nothing so VERY remarkable inthat; nor did Alice think it so VERY much

12
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,569
out of the way to hear the Rabbit say toitself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be

13
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,003
late!'

14
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,097
(when she thought it over afterwards, itoccurred to her that she ought to have

15
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:09,006
wondered at this, but at the time it allseemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit

16
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:12,016
actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-

17
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:17,065
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurriedon, Alice started to her feet, for it

18
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:21,056
flashed across her mind that she had neverbefore seen a rabbit with either a

19
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:24,012
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of

20
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:30,008
it, and burning with curiosity, she ranacross the field after it, and fortunately

21
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:36,041
was just in time to see it pop down a largerabbit-hole under the hedge.

22
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:41,037
In another moment down went Alice after it,never once considering how in the world she

23
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:44,026
was to get out again.

24
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:47,091
The rabbit-hole went straight on like atunnel for some way, and then dipped

25
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:52,038
suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice hadnot a moment to think about stopping

26
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:58,033
herself before she found herself fallingdown a very deep well.

27
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:03,003
Either the well was very deep, or she fellvery slowly, for she had plenty of time as

28
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:08,021
she went down to look about her and towonder what was going to happen next.

29
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:13,058
First, she tried to look down and make outwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark

30
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:18,022
to see anything; then she looked at thesides of the well, and noticed that they

31
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,053
were filled with cupboards and book-

32
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:24,075
shelves; here and there she saw maps andpictures hung upon pegs.

33
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:29,028
She took down a jar from one of the shelvesas she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE

34
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:34,047
MARMALADE', but to her great disappointmentit was empty: she did not like to drop the

35
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:36,093
jar for fear of killing somebody, so

36
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:42,021
managed to put it into one of the cupboardsas she fell past it.

37
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:47,043
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'aftersuch a fall as this, I shall think nothing

38
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,026
of tumbling down stairs!

39
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:54,027
How brave they'll all think me at home!Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even

40
00:02:54,027 --> 00:03:00,058
if I fell off the top of the house!'(Which was very likely true.)

41
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:01,046
Down, down, down.

42
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:07,009
Would the fall NEVER come to an end!'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by

43
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:11,006
this time?' she said aloud.'I must be getting somewhere near the

44
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,031
centre of the earth.

45
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:19,028
Let me see: that would be four thousandmiles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice

46
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,029
had learnt several things of this sort inher lessons in the schoolroom, and though

47
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,048
this was not a VERY good opportunity for

48
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:30,039
showing off her knowledge, as there was noone to listen to her, still it was good

49
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:37,043
practice to say it over) '--yes, that'sabout the right distance--but then I wonder

50
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:41,007
what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?'

51
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:45,059
(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, orLongitude either, but thought they were

52
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:51,004
nice grand words to say.)Presently she began again.

53
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:54,053
'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH theearth!

54
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:59,057
How funny it'll seem to come out among thepeople that walk with their heads downward!

55
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:05,869
The Antipathies, I think--' (she was ratherglad there WAS no one listening, this time,

56
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:11,034
as it didn't sound at all the right word)'--but I shall have to ask them what the

57
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,369
name of the country is, you know.

58
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:17,055
Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand orAustralia?'

59
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:22,091
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through

60
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,779
the air!

61
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:28,999
Do you think you could manage it?)'And what an ignorant little girl she'll

62
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:33,589
think me for asking!No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall

63
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,619
see it written up somewhere.'

64
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:41,959
Down, down, down.There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon

65
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,006
began talking again.'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I

66
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,063
should think!'

67
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:51,051
(Dinah was the cat.)'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk

68
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,709
at tea-time.Dinah my dear!

69
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,969
I wish you were down here with me!

70
00:04:55,969 --> 00:05:00,092
There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid,but you might catch a bat, and that's very

71
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:06,007
like a mouse, you know.But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'

72
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:11,063
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy,and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy

73
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:19,026
sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats?Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes,

74
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:24,091
'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as shecouldn't answer either question, it didn't

75
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,529
much matter which way she put it.

76
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:32,051
She felt that she was dozing off, and hadjust begun to dream that she was walking

77
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:38,489
hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to hervery earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the

78
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:41,082
truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when

79
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:46,091
suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upona heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the

80
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:50,089
fall was over.

81
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:55,529
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped upon to her feet in a moment: she looked up,

82
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:01,013
but it was all dark overhead; before herwas another long passage, and the White

83
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:04,179
Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying downit.

84
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:09,169
There was not a moment to be lost: awaywent Alice like the wind, and was just in

85
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:15,489
time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's

86
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,719
getting!'

87
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:21,469
She was close behind it when she turned thecorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be

88
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:27,179
seen: she found herself in a long, lowhall, which was lit up by a row of lamps

89
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,249
hanging from the roof.

90
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:34,004
There were doors all round the hall, butthey were all locked; and when Alice had

91
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:39,439
been all the way down one side and up theother, trying every door, she walked sadly

92
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,999
down the middle, wondering how she was everto get out again.

93
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:50,839
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;

94
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,066
there was nothing on it except a tinygolden key, and Alice's first thought was

95
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,006
that it might belong to one of the doors of

96
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:04,439
the hall; but, alas! either the locks weretoo large, or the key was too small, but at

97
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,859
any rate it would not open any of them.

98
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:11,999
However, on the second time round, she cameupon a low curtain she had not noticed

99
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:17,469
before, and behind it was a little doorabout fifteen inches high: she tried the

100
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:23,679
little golden key in the lock, and to hergreat delight it fitted!

101
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:28,389
Alice opened the door and found that it ledinto a small passage, not much larger than

102
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,709
a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked alongthe passage into the loveliest garden you

103
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,048
ever saw.

104
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:40,499
How she longed to get out of that darkhall, and wander about among those beds of

105
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:45,001
bright flowers and those cool fountains,but she could not even get her head through

106
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:48,249
the doorway; 'and even if my head would go

107
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:53,389
through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would beof very little use without my shoulders.

108
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,329
Oh, how I wish I could shut up like atelescope!

109
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:00,082
I think I could, if I only know how tobegin.'

110
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:05,619
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way thingshad happened lately, that Alice had begun

111
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,969
to think that very few things indeed werereally impossible.

112
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,389
There seemed to be no use in waiting by thelittle door, so she went back to the table,

113
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,249
half hoping she might find another key onit, or at any rate a book of rules for

114
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,001
shutting people up like telescopes: this

115
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:27,057
time she found a little bottle on it,('which certainly was not here before,'

116
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:33,006
said Alice,) and round the neck of thebottle was a paper label, with the words

117
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:38,699
'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it inlarge letters.

118
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:43,048
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' butthe wise little Alice was not going to do

119
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,084
THAT in a hurry.

120
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:52,199
'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and seewhether it's marked "poison" or not'; for

121
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,098
she had read several nice little historiesabout children who had got burnt, and eaten

122
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:59,034
up by wild beasts and other unpleasant

123
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:04,017
things, all because they WOULD not rememberthe simple rules their friends had taught

124
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:10,048
them: such as, that a red-hot poker willburn you if you hold it too long; and that

125
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,006
if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a

126
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:18,003
knife, it usually bleeds; and she had neverforgotten that, if you drink much from a

127
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:22,067
bottle marked 'poison,' it is almostcertain to disagree with you, sooner or

128
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:25,005
later.

129
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:30,119
However, this bottle was NOT marked'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it,

130
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:36,199
and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact,a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart,

131
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,059
custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee,

132
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,036
and hot buttered toast,) she very soonfinished it off.

133
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:52,249
'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'Imust be shutting up like a telescope.'

134
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:57,629
And so it was indeed: she was now only teninches high, and her face brightened up at

135
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,439
the thought that she was now the right sizefor going through the little door into that

136
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,077
lovely garden.

137
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:06,259
First, however, she waited for a fewminutes to see if she was going to shrink

138
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:12,017
any further: she felt a little nervousabout this; 'for it might end, you know,'

139
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:17,003
said Alice to herself, 'in my going outaltogether, like a candle.

140
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:20,048
I wonder what I should be like then?'

141
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:24,017
And she tried to fancy what the flame of acandle is like after the candle is blown

142
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:29,078
out, for she could not remember ever havingseen such a thing.

143
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:34,035
After a while, finding that nothing morehappened, she decided on going into the

144
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:40,002
garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!when she got to the door, she found she had

145
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:42,369
forgotten the little golden key, and when

146
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:47,259
she went back to the table for it, shefound she could not possibly reach it: she

147
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,034
could see it quite plainly through theglass, and she tried her best to climb up

148
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:53,059
one of the legs of the table, but it was

149
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:58,022
too slippery; and when she had tiredherself out with trying, the poor little

150
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:02,309
thing sat down and cried.

151
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:07,099
'Come, there's no use in crying like that!'said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I

152
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,067
advise you to leave off this minute!'

153
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:16,028
She generally gave herself very goodadvice, (though she very seldom followed

154
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:22,017
it), and sometimes she scolded herself soseverely as to bring tears into her eyes;

155
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,889
and once she remembered trying to box her

156
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:29,139
own ears for having cheated herself in agame of croquet she was playing against

157
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:35,036
herself, for this curious child was veryfond of pretending to be two people.

158
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:40,001
'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice,'to pretend to be two people!

159
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:46,084
Why, there's hardly enough of me left tomake ONE respectable person!'

160
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:51,092
Soon her eye fell on a little glass boxthat was lying under the table: she opened

161
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:58,034
it, and found in it a very small cake, onwhich the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully

162
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,429
marked in currants.

163
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:06,579
'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if itmakes me grow larger, I can reach the key;

164
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,329
and if it makes me grow smaller, I cancreep under the door; so either way I'll

165
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,001
get into the garden, and I don't care whichhappens!'

166
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,759
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously toherself, 'Which way?

167
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,002
Which way?', holding her hand on the top ofher head to feel which way it was growing,

168
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:30,079
and she was quite surprised to find thatshe remained the same size: to be sure,

169
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,679
this generally happens when one eats cake,

170
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,939
but Alice had got so much into the way ofexpecting nothing but out-of-the-way things

171
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:43,689
to happen, that it seemed quite dull andstupid for life to go on in the common way.

172
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:51,338
So she set to work, and very soon finishedoff the cake.

173
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,338
>

174
00:12:53,338 --> 00:13:01,627
Chapter II. The Pool of Tears

175
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:07,947
'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (shewas so much surprised, that for the moment

176
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:13,978
she quite forgot how to speak goodEnglish); 'now I'm opening out like the

177
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:16,178
largest telescope that ever was!

178
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:20,588
Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked downat her feet, they seemed to be almost out

179
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,468
of sight, they were getting so far off).

180
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:28,278
'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who willput on your shoes and stockings for you

181
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,788
now, dears?I'm sure I shan't be able!

182
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:35,308
I shall be a great deal too far off totrouble myself about you: you must manage

183
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:40,818
the best way you can;--but I must be kindto them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they

184
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,848
won't walk the way I want to go!

185
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:48,378
Let me see: I'll give them a new pair ofboots every Christmas.'

186
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:50,858
And she went on planning to herself how shewould manage it.

187
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:56,598
'They must go by the carrier,' she thought;'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents

188
00:13:56,598 --> 00:14:01,947
to one's own feet!And how odd the directions will look!

189
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:04,478
ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.HEARTHRUG,

190
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,198
NEAR THE FENDER,(WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

191
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,228
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

192
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:16,858
Just then her head struck against the roofof the hall: in fact she was now more than

193
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:22,277
nine feet high, and she at once took up thelittle golden key and hurried off to the

194
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,308
garden door.

195
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:29,648
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do,lying down on one side, to look through

196
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:35,118
into the garden with one eye; but to getthrough was more hopeless than ever: she

197
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:39,738
sat down and began to cry again.

198
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:45,018
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' saidAlice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might

199
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,338
well say this), 'to go on crying in thisway!

200
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,078
Stop this moment, I tell you!'

201
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,118
But she went on all the same, sheddinggallons of tears, until there was a large

202
00:14:56,118 --> 00:15:03,228
pool all round her, about four inches deepand reaching half down the hall.

203
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:07,297
After a time she heard a little patteringof feet in the distance, and she hastily

204
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,947
dried her eyes to see what was coming.

205
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:13,777
It was the White Rabbit returning,splendidly dressed, with a pair of white

206
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:18,907
kid gloves in one hand and a large fan inthe other: he came trotting along in a

207
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:24,137
great hurry, muttering to himself as hecame, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!

208
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:29,208
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept herwaiting!'

209
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:33,827
Alice felt so desperate that she was readyto ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit

210
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:41,357
came near her, she began, in a low, timidvoice, 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit

211
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,977
started violently, dropped the white kid

212
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:50,738
gloves and the fan, and skurried away intothe darkness as hard as he could go.

213
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:55,787
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, asthe hall was very hot, she kept fanning

214
00:15:55,787 --> 00:16:00,467
herself all the time she went on talking:'Dear, dear!

215
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,167
How queer everything is to-day!

216
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:07,598
And yesterday things went on just as usual.I wonder if I've been changed in the night?

217
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:11,477
Let me think: was I the same when I got upthis morning?

218
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:15,007
I almost think I can remember feeling alittle different.

219
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:19,988
But if I'm not the same, the next questionis, Who in the world am I?

220
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:23,738
Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'

221
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:27,098
And she began thinking over all thechildren she knew that were of the same age

222
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:30,577
as herself, to see if she could have beenchanged for any of them.

223
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:38,077
'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for herhair goes in such long ringlets, and mine

224
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:43,238
doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sureI can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of

225
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:46,958
things, and she, oh! she knows such a verylittle!

226
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:53,507
Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--ohdear, how puzzling it all is!

227
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:57,647
I'll try if I know all the things I used toknow.

228
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:04,378
Let me see: four times five is twelve, andfour times six is thirteen, and four times

229
00:17:04,378 --> 00:17:06,397
seven is--oh dear!

230
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:10,868
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!However, the Multiplication Table doesn't

231
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:13,697
signify: let's try Geography.

232
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:20,467
London is the capital of Paris, and Parisis the capital of Rome, and Rome--no,

233
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:24,627
THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!I must have been changed for Mabel!

234
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:30,067
I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'and she crossed her hands on her lap as if

235
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:34,588
she were saying lessons, and began torepeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and

236
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:38,358
strange, and the words did not come thesame as they used to do:--

237
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:43,898
'How doth the little crocodileImprove his shining tail,

238
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:47,858
And pour the waters of the NileOn every golden scale!

239
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:52,007
'How cheerfully he seems to grin,How neatly spread his claws,

240
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:56,067
And welcome little fishes inWith gently smiling jaws!'

241
00:17:56,067 --> 00:18:02,268
'I'm sure those are not the right words,'said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with

242
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:08,638
tears again as she went on, 'I must beMabel after all, and I shall have to go and

243
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,108
live in that poky little house, and have

244
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:16,078
next to no toys to play with, and oh! everso many lessons to learn!

245
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:20,877
No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'mMabel, I'll stay down here!

246
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:25,898
It'll be no use their putting their headsdown and saying "Come up again, dear!"

247
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,388
I shall only look up and say "Who am Ithen?

248
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:34,608
Tell me that first, and then, if I likebeing that person, I'll come up: if not,

249
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:39,948
I'll stay down here till I'm somebodyelse"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a

250
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:44,437
sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish theyWOULD put their heads down!

251
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:46,807
I am so VERY tired of being all alonehere!'

252
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:53,347
As she said this she looked down at herhands, and was surprised to see that she

253
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:57,747
had put on one of the Rabbit's little whitekid gloves while she was talking.

254
00:18:57,747 --> 00:19:01,708
'How CAN I have done that?' she thought.

255
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,648
'I must be growing small again.'

256
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:09,337
She got up and went to the table to measureherself by it, and found that, as nearly as

257
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:15,377
she could guess, she was now about two feethigh, and was going on shrinking rapidly:

258
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,298
she soon found out that the cause of this

259
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:21,708
was the fan she was holding, and shedropped it hastily, just in time to avoid

260
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,168
shrinking away altogether.

261
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:29,977
'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, agood deal frightened at the sudden change,

262
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:36,187
but very glad to find herself still inexistence; 'and now for the garden!' and

263
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,448
she ran with all speed back to the little

264
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:43,888
door: but, alas! the little door was shutagain, and the little golden key was lying

265
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:48,988
on the glass table as before, 'and thingsare worse than ever,' thought the poor

266
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,888
child, 'for I never was so small as thisbefore, never!

267
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:58,007
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'

268
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:03,078
As she said these words her foot slipped,and in another moment, splash! she was up

269
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,437
to her chin in salt water.

270
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:11,398
Her first idea was that she had somehowfallen into the sea, 'and in that case I

271
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:14,727
can go back by railway,' she said toherself.

272
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:18,687
(Alice had been to the seaside once in herlife, and had come to the general

273
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:23,807
conclusion, that wherever you go to on theEnglish coast you find a number of bathing

274
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,398
machines in the sea, some children digging

275
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:31,648
in the sand with wooden spades, then a rowof lodging houses, and behind them a

276
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,317
railway station.)

277
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:38,217
However, she soon made out that she was inthe pool of tears which she had wept when

278
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:39,227
she was nine feet high.

279
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:46,268
'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' saidAlice, as she swam about, trying to find

280
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:50,157
her way out.'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose,

281
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:52,467
by being drowned in my own tears!

282
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:58,787
That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!However, everything is queer to-day.'

283
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:02,717
Just then she heard something splashingabout in the pool a little way off, and she

284
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:07,798
swam nearer to make out what it was: atfirst she thought it must be a walrus or

285
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,108
hippopotamus, but then she remembered how

286
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:14,787
small she was now, and she soon made outthat it was only a mouse that had slipped

287
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:20,317
in like herself.'Would it be of any use, now,' thought

288
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:22,587
Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?

289
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:26,518
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here,that I should think very likely it can

290
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,937
talk: at any rate, there's no harm intrying.'

291
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:35,247
So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the wayout of this pool?

292
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:39,458
I am very tired of swimming about here, OMouse!'

293
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,107
(Alice thought this must be the right wayof speaking to a mouse: she had never done

294
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:48,078
such a thing before, but she rememberedhaving seen in her brother's Latin Grammar,

295
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:54,658
'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')

296
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:59,208
The Mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink

297
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:04,208
with one of its little eyes, but it saidnothing.

298
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:08,047
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,'thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French

299
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:11,278
mouse, come over with William theConqueror.'

300
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:16,047
(For, with all her knowledge of history,Alice had no very clear notion how long ago

301
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:17,658
anything had happened.)

302
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:23,677
So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?'which was the first sentence in her French

303
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,308
lesson-book.

304
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:29,518
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of thewater, and seemed to quiver all over with

305
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:29,698
fright.

306
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:35,588
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alicehastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor

307
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:40,927
animal's feelings.'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'

308
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:44,227
'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in ashrill, passionate voice.

309
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:50,278
'Would YOU like cats if you were me?''Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a

310
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:53,028
soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.

311
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:58,617
And yet I wish I could show you our catDinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats

312
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:00,268
if you could only see her.

313
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:05,638
She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice wenton, half to herself, as she swam lazily

314
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:11,888
about in the pool, 'and she sits purring sonicely by the fire, licking her paws and

315
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:14,688
washing her face--and she is such a nice

316
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,398
soft thing to nurse--and she's such acapital one for catching mice--oh, I beg

317
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:25,468
your pardon!' cried Alice again, for thistime the Mouse was bristling all over, and

318
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:28,708
she felt certain it must be reallyoffended.

319
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,938
'We won't talk about her any more if you'drather not.'

320
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:36,218
'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who wastrembling down to the end of his tail.

321
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:43,367
'As if I would talk on such a subject!Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low,

322
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:44,318
vulgar things!

323
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:50,278
Don't let me hear the name again!''I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great

324
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:53,208
hurry to change the subject ofconversation.

325
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:57,908
'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'

326
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:03,708
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went oneagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog

327
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,607
near our house I should like to show you!A little bright-eyed terrier, you know,

328
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,438
with oh, such long curly brown hair!

329
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:14,227
And it'll fetch things when you throw them,and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner,

330
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:18,617
and all sorts of things--I can't rememberhalf of them--and it belongs to a farmer,

331
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:22,388
you know, and he says it's so useful, it'sworth a hundred pounds!

332
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:28,468
He says it kills all the rats and--ohdear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,

333
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:32,058
'I'm afraid I've offended it again!'

334
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:36,367
For the Mouse was swimming away from her ashard as it could go, and making quite a

335
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:43,818
commotion in the pool as it went.So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!

336
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:48,487
Do come back again, and we won't talk aboutcats or dogs either, if you don't like

337
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:48,597
them!'

338
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:55,528
When the Mouse heard this, it turned roundand swam slowly back to her: its face was

339
00:24:55,528 --> 00:25:02,888
quite pale (with passion, Alice thought),and it said in a low trembling voice, 'Let

340
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:05,248
us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you

341
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:11,758
my history, and you'll understand why it isI hate cats and dogs.'

342
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:15,617
It was high time to go, for the pool wasgetting quite crowded with the birds and

343
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:21,308
animals that had fallen into it: there werea Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet,

344
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:24,068
and several other curious creatures.

345
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:32,338
Alice led the way, and the whole party swamto the shore.

346
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:33,338
>

347
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:41,948
Chapter III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

348
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:46,368
They were indeed a queer-looking party thatassembled on the bank--the birds with

349
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:50,828
draggled feathers, the animals with theirfur clinging close to them, and all

350
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:54,527
dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

351
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:59,048
The first question of course was, how toget dry again: they had a consultation

352
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:03,377
about this, and after a few minutes itseemed quite natural to Alice to find

353
00:26:03,377 --> 00:26:09,698
herself talking familiarly with them, as ifshe had known them all her life.

354
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:14,278
Indeed, she had quite a long argument withthe Lory, who at last turned sulky, and

355
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:20,298
would only say, 'I am older than you, andmust know better'; and this Alice would not

356
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,247
allow without knowing how old it was, and,

357
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:29,658
as the Lory positively refused to tell itsage, there was no more to be said.

358
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:33,278
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be aperson of authority among them, called out,

359
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,688
'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!

360
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:40,878
I'LL soon make you dry enough!'They all sat down at once, in a large ring,

361
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:42,488
with the Mouse in the middle.

362
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:47,388
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it,for she felt sure she would catch a bad

363
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:53,838
cold if she did not get dry very soon.'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important

364
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:55,948
air, 'are you all ready?

365
00:26:55,948 --> 00:27:01,358
This is the driest thing I know.Silence all round, if you please!

366
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:06,288
"William the Conqueror, whose cause wasfavoured by the pope, was soon submitted to

367
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:11,398
by the English, who wanted leaders, and hadbeen of late much accustomed to usurpation

368
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:12,938
and conquest.

369
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:16,648
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia andNorthumbria--"'

370
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:20,018
'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.

371
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:25,888
'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse,frowning, but very politely: 'Did you

372
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:29,728
speak?''Not I!' said the Lory hastily.

373
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:33,408
'I thought you did,' said the Mouse.

374
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:38,728
'--I proceed."Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and

375
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:43,258
Northumbria, declared for him: and evenStigand, the patriotic archbishop of

376
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:46,968
Canterbury, found it advisable--"'

377
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:51,358
'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather

378
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:54,508
crossly: 'of course you know what "it"means.'

379
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:59,638
'I know what "it" means well enough, when Ifind a thing,' said the Duck: 'it's

380
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:03,458
generally a frog or a worm.The question is, what did the archbishop

381
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,348
find?'

382
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:10,708
The Mouse did not notice this question, buthurriedly went on, '"--found it advisable

383
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:14,868
to go with Edgar Atheling to meet Williamand offer him the crown.

384
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:17,228
William's conduct at first was moderate.

385
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:22,868
But the insolence of his Normans--" How areyou getting on now, my dear?' it continued,

386
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,988
turning to Alice as it spoke.

387
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:30,578
'As wet as ever,' said Alice in amelancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to dry me

388
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,288
at all.'

389
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:37,198
'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly,rising to its feet, 'I move that the

390
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:42,518
meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoptionof more energetic remedies--'

391
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:44,518
'Speak English!' said the Eaglet.

392
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:47,678
'I don't know the meaning of half thoselong words, and, what's more, I don't

393
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:49,577
believe you do either!'

394
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:54,348
And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide asmile: some of the other birds tittered

395
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:54,797
audibly.

396
00:28:54,797 --> 00:29:01,858
'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo inan offended tone, 'was, that the best thing

397
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:04,208
to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'

398
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:11,018
'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; notthat she wanted much to know, but the Dodo

399
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:16,098
had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODYought to speak, and no one else seemed

400
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:17,988
inclined to say anything.

401
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:23,008
'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way toexplain it is to do it.'

402
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:27,157
(And, as you might like to try the thingyourself, some winter day, I will tell you

403
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:30,228
how the Dodo managed it.)

404
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:34,958
First it marked out a race-course, in asort of circle, ('the exact shape doesn't

405
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:39,288
matter,' it said,) and then all the partywere placed along the course, here and

406
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:40,187
there.

407
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:45,077
There was no 'One, two, three, and away,'but they began running when they liked, and

408
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:49,588
left off when they liked, so that it wasnot easy to know when the race was over.

409
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:54,238
However, when they had been running half anhour or so, and were quite dry again, the

410
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:58,277
Dodo suddenly called out 'The race isover!' and they all crowded round it,

411
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:02,427
panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'

412
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:06,198
This question the Dodo could not answerwithout a great deal of thought, and it sat

413
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:10,537
for a long time with one finger pressedupon its forehead (the position in which

414
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,337
you usually see Shakespeare, in the

415
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:15,927
pictures of him), while the rest waited insilence.

416
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:23,127
At last the Dodo said, 'EVERYBODY has won,and all must have prizes.'

417
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:27,497
'But who is to give the prizes?' quite achorus of voices asked.

418
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:32,567
'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo,pointing to Alice with one finger; and the

419
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:36,768
whole party at once crowded round her,calling out in a confused way, 'Prizes!

420
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,078
Prizes!'

421
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:43,557
Alice had no idea what to do, and indespair she put her hand in her pocket, and

422
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:48,717
pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily thesalt water had not got into it), and handed

423
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,207
them round as prizes.

424
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:55,638
There was exactly one a-piece all round.'But she must have a prize herself, you

425
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:00,108
know,' said the Mouse.'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.

426
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:05,147
'What else have you got in your pocket?' hewent on, turning to Alice.

427
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:09,537
'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.

428
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:14,537
Then they all crowded round her once more,while the Dodo solemnly presented the

429
00:31:14,537 --> 00:31:20,597
thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance ofthis elegant thimble'; and, when it had

430
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:24,847
finished this short speech, they allcheered.

431
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:28,858
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd,but they all looked so grave that she did

432
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:34,027
not dare to laugh; and, as she could notthink of anything to say, she simply bowed,

433
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:38,647
and took the thimble, looking as solemn asshe could.

434
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:43,497
The next thing was to eat the comfits: thiscaused some noise and confusion, as the

435
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:47,717
large birds complained that they could nottaste theirs, and the small ones choked and

436
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,467
had to be patted on the back.

437
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:54,567
However, it was over at last, and they satdown again in a ring, and begged the Mouse

438
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:57,578
to tell them something more.

439
00:31:57,578 --> 00:32:01,948
'You promised to tell me your history, youknow,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate-

440
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:09,507
-C and D,' she added in a whisper, halfafraid that it would be offended again.

441
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:14,337
'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said theMouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.

442
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:19,987
'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice,looking down with wonder at the Mouse's

443
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:23,388
tail; 'but why do you call it sad?'

444
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:27,798
And she kept on puzzling about it while theMouse was speaking, so that her idea of the

445
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:29,367
tale was something like this:--

446
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:39,847
'Fury said to amouse, That he

447
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:40,608
met in thehouse,

448
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:41,328
"Let us

472
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:07,307
'You are not attending!' said the Mouse toAlice severely.

473
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:09,457
'What are you thinking of?'

474
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:14,347
'I beg your pardon,' said Alice veryhumbly: 'you had got to the fifth bend, I

475
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:18,527
think?''I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and

476
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:19,977
very angrily.

477
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:24,787
'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to makeherself useful, and looking anxiously about

478
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:28,007
her.'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'

479
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,117
'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said theMouse, getting up and walking away.

480
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:37,668
'You insult me by talking such nonsense!''I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.

481
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:41,527
'But you're so easily offended, you know!'

482
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:46,418
The Mouse only growled in reply.'Please come back and finish your story!'

483
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:51,847
Alice called after it; and the others alljoined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the

484
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:56,867
Mouse only shook its head impatiently, andwalked a little quicker.

485
00:33:56,867 --> 00:34:00,638
'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed theLory, as soon as it was quite out of sight;

486
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:05,487
and an old Crab took the opportunity ofsaying to her daughter 'Ah, my dear!

487
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,728
Let this be a lesson to you never to loseYOUR temper!'

488
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:12,548
'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the youngCrab, a little snappishly.

489
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:16,668
'You're enough to try the patience of anoyster!'

490
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,408
'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!'said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in

491
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:22,588
particular.

492
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:27,658
'She'd soon fetch it back!''And who is Dinah, if I might venture to

493
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:30,808
ask the question?' said the Lory.

494
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:34,968
Alice replied eagerly, for she was alwaysready to talk about her pet: 'Dinah's our

495
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:37,548
cat.And she's such a capital one for catching

496
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:38,748
mice you can't think!

497
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:41,778
And oh, I wish you could see her after thebirds!

498
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:45,898
Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon aslook at it!'

499
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,708
This speech caused a remarkable sensationamong the party.

500
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:54,898
Some of the birds hurried off at once: oneold Magpie began wrapping itself up very

501
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:59,888
carefully, remarking, 'I really must begetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my

502
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:02,768
throat!' and a Canary called out in a

503
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:06,038
trembling voice to its children, 'Comeaway, my dears!

504
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:12,528
It's high time you were all in bed!'On various pretexts they all moved off, and

505
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,098
Alice was soon left alone.

506
00:35:14,098 --> 00:35:20,028
'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she saidto herself in a melancholy tone.

507
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:24,158
'Nobody seems to like her, down here, andI'm sure she's the best cat in the world!

508
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:25,708
Oh, my dear Dinah!

509
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:31,968
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'And here poor Alice began to cry again, for

510
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,168
she felt very lonely and low-spirited.

511
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:38,978
In a little while, however, she again hearda little pattering of footsteps in the

512
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:43,888
distance, and she looked up eagerly, halfhoping that the Mouse had changed his mind,

513
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:50,432
and was coming back to finish his story.

514
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:51,432
>

515
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:59,922
Chapter IV. The Rabbit Sends in a LittleBill

516
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:04,532
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowlyback again, and looking anxiously about as

517
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:09,612
it went, as if it had lost something; andshe heard it muttering to itself 'The

518
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:10,281
Duchess!

519
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:12,652
The Duchess!Oh my dear paws!

520
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:17,142
Oh my fur and whiskers!She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets

521
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,322
are ferrets!

522
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:22,902
Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?'

523
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:26,682
Alice guessed in a moment that it waslooking for the fan and the pair of white

524
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:31,112
kid gloves, and she very good-naturedlybegan hunting about for them, but they were

525
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:34,142
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to

526
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:38,712
have changed since her swim in the pool,and the great hall, with the glass table

527
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:43,561
and the little door, had vanishedcompletely.

528
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:47,662
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as shewent hunting about, and called out to her

529
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:52,232
in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what AREyou doing out here?

530
00:36:52,232 --> 00:36:55,902
Run home this moment, and fetch me a pairof gloves and a fan!

531
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:57,692
Quick, now!'

532
00:36:57,692 --> 00:37:02,042
And Alice was so much frightened that sheran off at once in the direction it pointed

533
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:06,042
to, without trying to explain the mistakeit had made.

534
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:10,692
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said toherself as she ran.

535
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:13,002
'How surprised he'll be when he finds outwho I am!

536
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:17,962
But I'd better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'

537
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:22,962
As she said this, she came upon a neatlittle house, on the door of which was a

538
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:26,022
bright brass plate with the name 'W.

539
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:28,102
RABBIT' engraved upon it.

540
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:32,452
She went in without knocking, and hurriedupstairs, in great fear lest she should

541
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:36,682
meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned outof the house before she had found the fan

542
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:37,212
and gloves.

543
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:43,722
'How queer it seems,' Alice said toherself, 'to be going messages for a

544
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,932
rabbit!I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on

545
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,252
messages next!'

546
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:51,682
And she began fancying the sort of thingthat would happen: '"Miss Alice!

547
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:55,522
Come here directly, and get ready for yourwalk!"

548
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:56,342
"Coming in a minute, nurse!

549
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,682
But I've got to see that the mouse doesn'tget out."

550
00:37:58,682 --> 00:38:04,712
Only I don't think,' Alice went on, 'thatthey'd let Dinah stop in the house if it

551
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:08,322
began ordering people about like that!'

552
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:12,612
By this time she had found her way into atidy little room with a table in the

553
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:18,682
window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fanand two or three pairs of tiny white kid

554
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:21,102
gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of

555
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:25,302
the gloves, and was just going to leave theroom, when her eye fell upon a little

556
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,522
bottle that stood near the looking-glass.

557
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:33,022
There was no label this time with the words'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked

558
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:34,432
it and put it to her lips.

559
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:39,882
'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure tohappen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I

560
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:43,352
eat or drink anything; so I'll just seewhat this bottle does.

561
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:48,472
I do hope it'll make me grow large again,for really I'm quite tired of being such a

562
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:51,172
tiny little thing!'

563
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:56,141
It did so indeed, and much sooner than shehad expected: before she had drunk half the

564
00:38:56,141 --> 00:39:00,782
bottle, she found her head pressing againstthe ceiling, and had to stoop to save her

565
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,862
neck from being broken.

566
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:07,672
She hastily put down the bottle, saying toherself 'That's quite enough--I hope I

567
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:12,712
shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't getout at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk

568
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:16,012
quite so much!'

569
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:18,402
Alas! it was too late to wish that!

570
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:23,062
She went on growing, and growing, and verysoon had to kneel down on the floor: in

571
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:27,012
another minute there was not even room forthis, and she tried the effect of lying

572
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:32,202
down with one elbow against the door, andthe other arm curled round her head.

573
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:37,082
Still she went on growing, and, as a lastresource, she put one arm out of the

574
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:42,531
window, and one foot up the chimney, andsaid to herself 'Now I can do no more,

575
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:43,362
whatever happens.

576
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:47,202
What WILL become of me?'

577
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:51,641
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottlehad now had its full effect, and she grew

578
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:57,001
no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,and, as there seemed to be no sort of

579
00:39:57,001 --> 00:40:03,641
chance of her ever getting out of the roomagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.

580
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:07,981
'It was much pleasanter at home,' thoughtpoor Alice, 'when one wasn't always growing

581
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:12,112
larger and smaller, and being ordered aboutby mice and rabbits.

582
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:18,142
I almost wish I hadn't gone down thatrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather

583
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:23,091
curious, you know, this sort of life!I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!

584
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:27,522
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fanciedthat kind of thing never happened, and now

585
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:31,031
here I am in the middle of one!There ought to be a book written about me,

586
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:31,941
that there ought!

587
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:37,012
And when I grow up, I'll write one--but I'mgrown up now,' she added in a sorrowful

588
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:42,411
tone; 'at least there's no room to grow upany more HERE.'

589
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:47,371
'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVERget any older than I am now?

590
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:52,411
That'll be a comfort, one way--never to bean old woman--but then--always to have

591
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,982
lessons to learn!

592
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:58,521
Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!''Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered

593
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:01,521
herself.'How can you learn lessons in here?

594
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:07,042
Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and noroom at all for any lesson-books!'

595
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:11,711
And so she went on, taking first one sideand then the other, and making quite a

596
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:16,621
conversation of it altogether; but after afew minutes she heard a voice outside, and

597
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:19,552
stopped to listen.

598
00:41:19,552 --> 00:41:22,131
'Mary Ann!Mary Ann!' said the voice.

599
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:27,452
'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'Then came a little pattering of feet on the

600
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,542
stairs.

601
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:32,501
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to lookfor her, and she trembled till she shook

602
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:36,661
the house, quite forgetting that she wasnow about a thousand times as large as the

603
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:41,232
Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid ofit.

604
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:45,371
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door,and tried to open it; but, as the door

605
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:50,341
opened inwards, and Alice's elbow waspressed hard against it, that attempt

606
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,591
proved a failure.

607
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:57,042
Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll goround and get in at the window.'

608
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:03,762
'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, afterwaiting till she fancied she heard the

609
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:08,591
Rabbit just under the window, she suddenlyspread out her hand, and made a snatch in

610
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:09,961
the air.

611
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:14,371
She did not get hold of anything, but sheheard a little shriek and a fall, and a

612
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:19,211
crash of broken glass, from which sheconcluded that it was just possible it had

613
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:24,112
fallen into a cucumber-frame, or somethingof the sort.

614
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:26,591
Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat!

615
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:27,131
Pat!

616
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:30,851
Where are you?'And then a voice she had never heard

617
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:36,251
before, 'Sure then I'm here!Digging for apples, yer honour!'

618
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:38,952
'Digging for apples, indeed!' said theRabbit angrily.

619
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:42,691
'Here!Come and help me out of THIS!'

620
00:42:42,691 --> 00:42:45,581
(Sounds of more broken glass.)

621
00:42:45,581 --> 00:42:49,491
'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in thewindow?'

622
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:54,681
'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'(He pronounced it 'arrum.')

623
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:55,881
'An arm, you goose!

624
00:42:55,881 --> 00:43:00,331
Who ever saw one that size?Why, it fills the whole window!'

625
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:04,362
'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an armfor all that.'

626
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:09,301
'Well, it's got no business there, at anyrate: go and take it away!'

627
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:14,172
There was a long silence after this, andAlice could only hear whispers now and

628
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:19,482
then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yerhonour, at all, at all!'

629
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:25,021
'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at lastshe spread out her hand again, and made

630
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:29,331
another snatch in the air.This time there were TWO little shrieks,

631
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:33,191
and more sounds of broken glass.

632
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:36,702
'What a number of cucumber-frames theremust be!' thought Alice.

633
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:40,542
'I wonder what they'll do next!As for pulling me out of the window, I only

634
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:41,621
wish they COULD!

635
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:45,642
I'm sure I don't want to stay in here anylonger!'

636
00:43:45,642 --> 00:43:50,341
She waited for some time without hearinganything more: at last came a rumbling of

637
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:55,762
little cartwheels, and the sound of a goodmany voices all talking together: she made

638
00:43:55,762 --> 00:43:59,001
out the words: 'Where's the other ladder?

639
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:03,341
--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill'sgot the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!

640
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:07,892
--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie'em together first--they don't reach half

641
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:12,871
high enough yet--Oh! they'll do wellenough; don't be particular--Here, Bill!

642
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:16,482
catch hold of this rope--Will the roofbear?

643
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:18,861
--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's comingdown!

644
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:20,262
Heads below!'

645
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:27,001
(a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go down

646
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,851
the chimney?--Nay, I shan't!

647
00:44:29,851 --> 00:44:31,091
YOU do it!

648
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:35,482
--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master

649
00:44:35,482 --> 00:44:39,211
says you're to go down the chimney!''Oh!

650
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:43,701
So Bill's got to come down the chimney, hashe?' said Alice to herself.

651
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:45,932
'Shy, they seem to put everything uponBill!

652
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:51,122
I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a gooddeal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure;

653
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:55,711
but I THINK I can kick a little!'

654
00:44:55,711 --> 00:45:00,001
She drew her foot as far down the chimneyas she could, and waited till she heard a

655
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:04,961
little animal (she couldn't guess of whatsort it was) scratching and scrambling

656
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:07,432
about in the chimney close above her: then,

657
00:45:07,432 --> 00:45:14,152
saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gaveone sharp kick, and waited to see what

658
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,992
would happen next.

659
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:21,792
The first thing she heard was a generalchorus of 'There goes Bill!' then the

660
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:28,282
Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you bythe hedge!' then silence, and then another

661
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:31,352
confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--

662
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:34,842
Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it,old fellow?

663
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:39,152
What happened to you?Tell us all about it!'

664
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:46,182
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice,('That's Bill,' thought Alice,) 'Well, I

665
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:50,732
hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm betternow--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell

666
00:45:50,732 --> 00:45:53,062
you--all I know is, something comes at me

667
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:57,612
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes likea sky-rocket!'

668
00:45:57,612 --> 00:45:59,451
'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.

669
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:05,441
'We must burn the house down!' said theRabbit's voice; and Alice called out as

670
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:11,652
loud as she could, 'If you do.I'll set Dinah at you!'

671
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:17,391
There was a dead silence instantly, andAlice thought to herself, 'I wonder what

672
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:21,052
they WILL do next!If they had any sense, they'd take the roof

673
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:23,602
off.'

674
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:27,242
After a minute or two, they began movingabout again, and Alice heard the Rabbit

675
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:32,261
say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'

676
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:37,141
'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; butshe had not long to doubt, for the next

677
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:41,211
moment a shower of little pebbles camerattling in at the window, and some of them

678
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,061
hit her in the face.

679
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:48,191
'I'll put a stop to this,' she said toherself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not

680
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:54,001
do that again!' which produced another deadsilence.

681
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:57,742
Alice noticed with some surprise that thepebbles were all turning into little cakes

682
00:46:57,742 --> 00:47:02,751
as they lay on the floor, and a bright ideacame into her head.

683
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:08,381
'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought,'it's sure to make SOME change in my size;

684
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:14,362
and as it can't possibly make me larger, itmust make me smaller, I suppose.'

685
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:18,571
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and wasdelighted to find that she began shrinking

686
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:19,821
directly.

687
00:47:19,821 --> 00:47:23,561
As soon as she was small enough to getthrough the door, she ran out of the house,

688
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:28,222
and found quite a crowd of little animalsand birds waiting outside.

689
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:33,261
The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in themiddle, being held up by two guinea-pigs,

690
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:35,732
who were giving it something out of abottle.

691
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:40,331
They all made a rush at Alice the momentshe appeared; but she ran off as hard as

692
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:45,641
she could, and soon found herself safe in athick wood.

693
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:49,571
'The first thing I've got to do,' saidAlice to herself, as she wandered about in

694
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:54,742
the wood, 'is to grow to my right sizeagain; and the second thing is to find my

695
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:57,032
way into that lovely garden.

696
00:47:57,032 --> 00:48:00,501
I think that will be the best plan.'

697
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:05,112
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, andvery neatly and simply arranged; the only

698
00:48:05,112 --> 00:48:09,631
difficulty was, that she had not thesmallest idea how to set about it; and

699
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:11,641
while she was peering about anxiously among

700
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:16,891
the trees, a little sharp bark just overher head made her look up in a great hurry.

701
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:23,771
An enormous puppy was looking down at herwith large round eyes, and feebly

702
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:27,371
stretching out one paw, trying to touchher.

703
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:32,552
'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in acoaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle

704
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:36,612
to it; but she was terribly frightened allthe time at the thought that it might be

705
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:38,972
hungry, in which case it would be very

706
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:43,691
likely to eat her up in spite of all hercoaxing.

707
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:47,451
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked upa little bit of stick, and held it out to

708
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:52,282
the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped intothe air off all its feet at once, with a

709
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:54,802
yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,

710
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:59,612
and made believe to worry it; then Alicedodged behind a great thistle, to keep

711
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:03,621
herself from being run over; and the momentshe appeared on the other side, the puppy

712
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:06,021
made another rush at the stick, and tumbled

713
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:11,451
head over heels in its hurry to get hold ofit; then Alice, thinking it was very like

714
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:16,071
having a game of play with a cart-horse,and expecting every moment to be trampled

715
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:18,261
under its feet, ran round the thistle

716
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:23,121
again; then the puppy began a series ofshort charges at the stick, running a very

717
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:27,891
little way forwards each time and a longway back, and barking hoarsely all the

718
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:30,412
while, till at last it sat down a good way

719
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:37,941
off, panting, with its tongue hanging outof its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

720
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:42,121
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity formaking her escape; so she set off at once,

721
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:47,172
and ran till she was quite tired and out ofbreath, and till the puppy's bark sounded

722
00:49:47,172 --> 00:49:51,112
quite faint in the distance.

723
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:55,431
'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!'said Alice, as she leant against a

724
00:49:55,431 --> 00:50:00,492
buttercup to rest herself, and fannedherself with one of the leaves: 'I should

725
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:02,532
have liked teaching it tricks very much,

726
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:06,321
if--if I'd only been the right size to doit!

727
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:09,121
Oh dear!I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow

728
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:10,102
up again!

729
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:15,862
Let me see--how IS it to be managed?I suppose I ought to eat or drink something

730
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:23,191
or other; but the great question is, what?'The great question certainly was, what?

731
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:27,672
Alice looked all round her at the flowersand the blades of grass, but she did not

732
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:31,191
see anything that looked like the rightthing to eat or drink under the

733
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:33,331
circumstances.

734
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:38,061
There was a large mushroom growing nearher, about the same height as herself; and

735
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:42,912
when she had looked under it, and on bothsides of it, and behind it, it occurred to

736
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:47,501
her that she might as well look and seewhat was on the top of it.

737
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:51,902
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, andpeeped over the edge of the mushroom, and

738
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:56,681
her eyes immediately met those of a largecaterpillar, that was sitting on the top

739
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:59,612
with its arms folded, quietly smoking a

740
00:50:59,612 --> 00:51:11,432
long hookah, and taking not the smallestnotice of her or of anything else.

741

Chapter V. Advice from a Caterpillar

743
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:25,582
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at eachother for some time in silence: at last the

744
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,371
Caterpillar took the hookah out of itsmouth, and addressed her in a languid,

745
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:31,832
sleepy voice.

746
00:51:31,832 --> 00:51:38,222
'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.This was not an encouraging opening for a

747
00:51:38,222 --> 00:51:39,201
conversation.

748
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:46,062
Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardlyknow, sir, just at present--at least I know

749
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:50,731
who I WAS when I got up this morning, but Ithink I must have been changed several

750
00:51:50,731 --> 00:51:53,831
times since then.'

751
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:57,292
'What do you mean by that?' said theCaterpillar sternly.

752
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:00,241
'Explain yourself!'

753
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:05,842
'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir'said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you

754
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:10,631
see.''I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.

755
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:15,671
'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,'Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't

756
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:20,832
understand it myself to begin with; andbeing so many different sizes in a day is

757
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:23,382
very confusing.'

758
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:26,362
'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.

759
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:30,092
'Well, perhaps you haven't found it soyet,' said Alice; 'but when you have to

760
00:52:30,092 --> 00:52:35,252
turn into a chrysalis--you will some day,you know--and then after that into a

761
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:39,752
butterfly, I should think you'll feel it alittle queer, won't you?'

762
00:52:39,752 --> 00:52:42,592
'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.

763
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,262
'Well, perhaps your feelings may bedifferent,' said Alice; 'all I know is, it

764
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:52,142
would feel very queer to ME.''You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.

765
00:52:52,142 --> 00:52:55,322
'Who are YOU?'

766
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:58,682
Which brought them back again to thebeginning of the conversation.

767
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:02,562
Alice felt a little irritated at theCaterpillar's making such VERY short

768
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:08,322
remarks, and she drew herself up and said,very gravely, 'I think, you ought to tell

769
00:53:08,322 --> 00:53:11,752
me who YOU are, first.'

770
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:14,782
'Why?' said the Caterpillar.

771
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:19,152
Here was another puzzling question; and asAlice could not think of any good reason,

772
00:53:19,152 --> 00:53:23,851
and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in aVERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned

773
00:53:23,851 --> 00:53:25,732
away.

774
00:53:25,732 --> 00:53:28,081
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called afterher.

775
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:34,191
'I've something important to say!'This sounded promising, certainly: Alice

776
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,881
turned and came back again.

777
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:42,961
'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down

778
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:48,702
her anger as well as she could.'No,' said the Caterpillar.

779
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:52,732
Alice thought she might as well wait, asshe had nothing else to do, and perhaps

780
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:57,062
after all it might tell her something worthhearing.

781
00:53:57,062 --> 00:54:01,411
For some minutes it puffed away withoutspeaking, but at last it unfolded its arms,

782
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:06,732
took the hookah out of its mouth again, andsaid, 'So you think you're changed, do

783
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:08,181
you?'

784
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:12,782
'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'Ican't remember things as I used--and I

785
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,941
don't keep the same size for ten minutestogether!'

786
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:20,702
'Can't remember WHAT things?' said theCaterpillar.

787
00:54:20,702 --> 00:54:25,032
'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THELITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came

788
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,342
different!'

789
00:54:26,342 --> 00:54:33,791
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"'

790
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:36,751
said the Caterpillar.

791
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:42,241
Alice folded her hands, and began:--'You are old, Father William,'

792
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:45,291
the young man said,'And your hair has become very white;

793
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:48,342
And yet you incessantlystand on your head--

794
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:50,491
Do you think, at your age, it is right?'

795
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:54,591
'In my youth,' Father Williamreplied to his son,

796
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,001
I feared it might injure the brain;

797
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,662
But, now that I'm perfectly sureI have none,

798
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:01,641
Why, I do it again and again.'

799
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:06,131
'You are old,' said the youth,'as I mentioned before,

800
00:55:06,131 --> 00:55:08,381
And have grown most uncommonly fat;

801
00:55:08,381 --> 00:55:11,171
Yet you turned a back-somersaultin at the door--

802
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:13,262
Pray, what is the reason of that?'

803
00:55:13,262 --> 00:55:17,521
'In my youth,' said the sage,as he shook his grey locks,

804
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,631
'I kept all my limbs very supple

805
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:23,452
By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--

806
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:24,661
Allow me to sell you a couple?'

807
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:28,762
'You are old,' said the youth,'and your jaws are too weak

808
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:30,192
For anything tougher than suet;

809
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:33,552
Yet you finished the goose,with the bones and the beak--

810
00:55:33,552 --> 00:55:35,302
Pray how did you manage to do it?'

811
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:39,592
'In my youth,' said his father,'I took to the law,

812
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:41,682
And argued each case with my wife;

813
00:55:41,682 --> 00:55:44,582
And the muscular strength,which it gave to my jaw,

814
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,272
Has lasted the rest of my life.'

815
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:51,212
'You are old,' said the youth,'one would hardly suppose

816
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:52,942
That your eye was as steady as ever;

817
00:55:52,942 --> 00:55:56,052
Yet you balanced an eelon the end of your nose--

818
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,002
What made you so awfully clever?'

819
00:55:58,002 --> 00:56:01,972
'I have answered three questions,and that is enough,'

820
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:04,202
Said his father;'don't give yourself airs!

821
00:56:04,202 --> 00:56:06,842
Do you think I can listenall day to such stuff?

822
00:56:06,842 --> 00:56:09,172
Be off, or I'll kick youdown stairs!'

823
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:16,052
'That is not said right,' said theCaterpillar.

824
00:56:16,052 --> 00:56:20,642
'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice,timidly; 'some of the words have got

825
00:56:20,642 --> 00:56:22,462
altered.'

826
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:27,552
'It is wrong from beginning to end,' saidthe Caterpillar decidedly, and there was

827
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:34,272
silence for some minutes.The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

828
00:56:34,272 --> 00:56:36,792
'What size do you want to be?' it asked.

829
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:44,032
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alicehastily replied; 'only one doesn't like

830
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:50,832
changing so often, you know.''I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.

831
00:56:50,832 --> 00:56:56,072
Alice said nothing: she had never been somuch contradicted in her life before, and

832
00:56:56,072 --> 00:57:01,572
she felt that she was losing her temper.'Are you content now?' said the

833
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:03,392
Caterpillar.

834
00:57:03,392 --> 00:57:07,482
'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger,sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice:

835
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:12,192
'three inches is such a wretched height tobe.'

836
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:16,712
'It is a very good height indeed!' said theCaterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright

837
00:57:16,712 --> 00:57:21,642
as it spoke (it was exactly three incheshigh).

838
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:25,702
'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poorAlice in a piteous tone.

839
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:32,802
And she thought of herself, 'I wish thecreatures wouldn't be so easily offended!'

840
00:57:32,802 --> 00:57:37,452
'You'll get used to it in time,' said theCaterpillar; and it put the hookah into its

841
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:43,092
mouth and began smoking again.This time Alice waited patiently until it

842
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,182
chose to speak again.

843
00:57:45,182 --> 00:57:49,612
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took thehookah out of its mouth and yawned once or

844
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:51,542
twice, and shook itself.

845
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:56,062
Then it got down off the mushroom, andcrawled away in the grass, merely remarking

846
00:57:56,062 --> 00:58:02,002
as it went, 'One side will make you growtaller, and the other side will make you

847
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:04,682
grow shorter.'

848
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:08,372
'One side of WHAT?The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to

849
00:58:08,372 --> 00:58:10,422
herself.

850
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:15,332
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar,just as if she had asked it aloud; and in

851
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:19,792
another moment it was out of sight.

852
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:23,962
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at themushroom for a minute, trying to make out

853
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:28,652
which were the two sides of it; and as itwas perfectly round, she found this a very

854
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:30,122
difficult question.

855
00:58:30,122 --> 00:58:35,082
However, at last she stretched her armsround it as far as they would go, and broke

856
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:39,572
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

857
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:45,232
'And now which is which?' she said toherself, and nibbled a little of the right-

858
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:50,352
hand bit to try the effect: the next momentshe felt a violent blow underneath her

859
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,222
chin: it had struck her foot!

860
00:58:52,222 --> 00:58:57,442
She was a good deal frightened by this verysudden change, but she felt that there was

861
00:58:57,442 --> 00:59:02,112
no time to be lost, as she was shrinkingrapidly; so she set to work at once to eat

862
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:04,002
some of the other bit.

863
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:08,142
Her chin was pressed so closely against herfoot, that there was hardly room to open

864
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:13,302
her mouth; but she did it at last, andmanaged to swallow a morsel of the lefthand

865
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:15,492
bit.

866
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:19,922
'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alicein a tone of delight, which changed into

867
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:23,922
alarm in another moment, when she foundthat her shoulders were nowhere to be

868
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:26,612
found: all she could see, when she looked

869
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:32,262
down, was an immense length of neck, whichseemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of

870
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:38,971
green leaves that lay far below her.'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said

871
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:39,342
Alice.

872
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:44,762
'And where HAVE my shoulders got to?And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't

873
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:47,142
see you?'

874
00:59:47,142 --> 00:59:52,111
She was moving them about as she spoke, butno result seemed to follow, except a little

875
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:56,132
shaking among the distant green leaves.

876
00:59:56,132 --> 01:00:00,152
As there seemed to be no chance of gettingher hands up to her head, she tried to get

877
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:04,602
her head down to them, and was delighted tofind that her neck would bend about easily

878
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:06,812
in any direction, like a serpent.

879
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:11,792
She had just succeeded in curving it downinto a graceful zigzag, and was going to

880
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:15,642
dive in among the leaves, which she foundto be nothing but the tops of the trees

881
01:00:15,642 --> 01:00:17,762
under which she had been wandering, when a

882
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:23,502
sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: alarge pigeon had flown into her face, and

883
01:00:23,502 --> 01:00:30,542
was beating her violently with its wings.'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.

884
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:33,772
'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Aliceindignantly.

885
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:36,402
'Let me alone!'

886
01:00:36,402 --> 01:00:40,912
'Serpent, I say again!' repeated thePigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and

887
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:45,852
added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried everyway, and nothing seems to suit them!'

888
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:52,002
'I haven't the least idea what you'retalking about,' said Alice.

889
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:56,672
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I'vetried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the

890
01:00:56,672 --> 01:01:00,792
Pigeon went on, without attending to her;'but those serpents!

891
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:04,722
There's no pleasing them!'

892
01:01:04,722 --> 01:01:09,122
Alice was more and more puzzled, but shethought there was no use in saying anything

893
01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:12,642
more till the Pigeon had finished.

894
01:01:12,642 --> 01:01:16,962
'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatchingthe eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be

895
01:01:16,962 --> 01:01:21,832
on the look-out for serpents night and day!Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these

896
01:01:21,832 --> 01:01:24,512
three weeks!'

897
01:01:24,512 --> 01:01:28,342
'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' saidAlice, who was beginning to see its

898
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,482
meaning.

899
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:35,162
'And just as I'd taken the highest tree inthe wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising

900
01:01:35,162 --> 01:01:39,962
its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I wasthinking I should be free of them at last,

901
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,272
they must needs come wriggling down fromthe sky!

902
01:01:43,272 --> 01:01:49,562
Ugh, Serpent!''But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said

903
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:50,512
Alice.

904
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:54,202
'I'm a--I'm a--''Well!

905
01:01:54,202 --> 01:01:57,671
WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.'I can see you're trying to invent

906
01:01:57,671 --> 01:01:58,152
something!'

907
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:06,132
'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, ratherdoubtfully, as she remembered the number of

908
01:02:06,132 --> 01:02:12,132
changes she had gone through that day.'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in

909
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:14,421
a tone of the deepest contempt.

910
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:18,692
'I've seen a good many little girls in mytime, but never ONE with such a neck as

911
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:20,682
that!No, no!

912
01:02:20,682 --> 01:02:23,772
You're a serpent; and there's no usedenying it.

913
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:29,622
I suppose you'll be telling me next thatyou never tasted an egg!'

914
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:34,861
'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' saidAlice, who was a very truthful child; 'but

915
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:39,302
little girls eat eggs quite as much asserpents do, you know.'

916
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:43,562
'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'butif they do, why then they're a kind of

917
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:47,382
serpent, that's all I can say.'

918
01:02:47,382 --> 01:02:52,611
This was such a new idea to Alice, that shewas quite silent for a minute or two, which

919
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:58,142
gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding,'You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well

920
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:00,132
enough; and what does it matter to me

921
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:04,132
whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'

922
01:03:04,132 --> 01:03:09,082
'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alicehastily; 'but I'm not looking for eggs, as

923
01:03:09,082 --> 01:03:15,122
it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't wantYOURS: I don't like them raw.'

924
01:03:15,122 --> 01:03:19,432
'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in asulky tone, as it settled down again into

925
01:03:19,432 --> 01:03:21,602
its nest.

926
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:25,822
Alice crouched down among the trees as wellas she could, for her neck kept getting

927
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:31,152
entangled among the branches, and every nowand then she had to stop and untwist it.

928
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:35,492
After a while she remembered that she stillheld the pieces of mushroom in her hands,

929
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:39,912
and she set to work very carefully,nibbling first at one and then at the

930
01:03:39,912 --> 01:03:42,361
other, and growing sometimes taller and

931
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:46,812
sometimes shorter, until she had succeededin bringing herself down to her usual

932
01:03:46,812 --> 01:03:48,702
height.

933
01:03:48,702 --> 01:03:52,912
It was so long since she had been anythingnear the right size, that it felt quite

934
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:57,342
strange at first; but she got used to it ina few minutes, and began talking to

935
01:03:57,342 --> 01:03:59,481
herself, as usual.

936
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:03,812
'Come, there's half my plan done now!How puzzling all these changes are!

937
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:07,372
I'm never sure what I'm going to be, fromone minute to another!

938
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:12,332
However, I've got back to my right size:the next thing is, to get into that

939
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:17,372
beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, Iwonder?'

940
01:04:17,372 --> 01:04:22,022
As she said this, she came suddenly upon anopen place, with a little house in it about

941
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:22,671
four feet high.

942
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:28,512
'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice,'it'll never do to come upon them THIS

943
01:04:28,512 --> 01:04:32,932
size: why, I should frighten them out oftheir wits!'

944
01:04:32,932 --> 01:04:37,992
So she began nibbling at the righthand bitagain, and did not venture to go near the

945
01:04:37,992 --> 01:04:46,832
house till she had brought herself down tonine inches high.

946
01:04:46,832 --> 01:04:47,832
>

947
01:04:47,832 --> 01:04:55,922
Chapter VI. Pig and Pepper

948
01:04:55,922 --> 01:05:00,562
For a minute or two she stood looking atthe house, and wondering what to do next,

949
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:05,281
when suddenly a footman in livery camerunning out of the wood--(she considered

950
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:06,982
him to be a footman because he was in

951
01:05:06,982 --> 01:05:13,331
livery: otherwise, judging by his faceonly, she would have called him a fish)--

952
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:18,181
and rapped loudly at the door with hisknuckles.

953
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:22,992
It was opened by another footman in livery,with a round face, and large eyes like a

954
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:28,121
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, hadpowdered hair that curled all over their

955
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:29,132
heads.

956
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:33,582
She felt very curious to know what it wasall about, and crept a little way out of

957
01:05:33,582 --> 01:05:36,411
the wood to listen.

958
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:41,211
The Fish-Footman began by producing fromunder his arm a great letter, nearly as

959
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:46,992
large as himself, and this he handed overto the other, saying, in a solemn tone,

960
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:48,301
'For the Duchess.

961
01:05:48,301 --> 01:05:52,432
An invitation from the Queen to playcroquet.'

962
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:57,192
The Frog-Footman repeated, in the samesolemn tone, only changing the order of the

963
01:05:57,192 --> 01:05:59,582
words a little, 'From the Queen.

964
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:04,612
An invitation for the Duchess to playcroquet.'

965
01:06:04,612 --> 01:06:09,792
Then they both bowed low, and their curlsgot entangled together.

966
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:14,021
Alice laughed so much at this, that she hadto run back into the wood for fear of their

967
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:18,902
hearing her; and when she next peeped outthe Fish-Footman was gone, and the other

968
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:24,801
was sitting on the ground near the door,staring stupidly up into the sky.

969
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:26,981
Alice went timidly up to the door, andknocked.

970
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:33,472
'There's no sort of use in knocking,' saidthe Footman, 'and that for two reasons.

971
01:06:33,472 --> 01:06:37,892
First, because I'm on the same side of thedoor as you are; secondly, because they're

972
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:41,241
making such a noise inside, no one couldpossibly hear you.'

973
01:06:41,241 --> 01:06:47,061
And certainly there was a mostextraordinary noise going on within--a

974
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:52,832
constant howling and sneezing, and everynow and then a great crash, as if a dish or

975
01:06:52,832 --> 01:06:56,121
kettle had been broken to pieces.

976
01:06:56,121 --> 01:07:01,012
'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I toget in?'

977
01:07:01,012 --> 01:07:05,022
'There might be some sense in yourknocking,' the Footman went on without

978
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:08,082
attending to her, 'if we had the doorbetween us.

979
01:07:08,082 --> 01:07:14,582
For instance, if you were INSIDE, you mightknock, and I could let you out, you know.'

980
01:07:14,582 --> 01:07:19,192
He was looking up into the sky all the timehe was speaking, and this Alice thought

981
01:07:19,192 --> 01:07:21,732
decidedly uncivil.

982
01:07:21,732 --> 01:07:26,541
'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said toherself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at

983
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:30,982
the top of his head.But at any rate he might answer questions.

984
01:07:30,982 --> 01:07:34,122
--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.

985
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:41,732
'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked,'till tomorrow--'

986
01:07:41,732 --> 01:07:45,972
At this moment the door of the houseopened, and a large plate came skimming

987
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:51,302
out, straight at the Footman's head: itjust grazed his nose, and broke to pieces

988
01:07:51,302 --> 01:07:55,101
against one of the trees behind him.

989
01:07:55,101 --> 01:08:00,491
'--or next day, maybe,' the Footmancontinued in the same tone, exactly as if

990
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:07,592
nothing had happened.'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in

991
01:08:07,592 --> 01:08:10,541
a louder tone.

992
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:12,732
'ARE you to get in at all?' said theFootman.

993
01:08:12,732 --> 01:08:18,872
'That's the first question, you know.'It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like

994
01:08:18,872 --> 01:08:19,521
to be told so.

995
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:26,431
'It's really dreadful,' she muttered toherself, 'the way all the creatures argue.

996
01:08:26,431 --> 01:08:29,982
It's enough to drive one crazy!'

997
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:33,662
The Footman seemed to think this a goodopportunity for repeating his remark, with

998
01:08:33,662 --> 01:08:39,381
variations.'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off,

999
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:43,211
for days and days.'

1000
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:48,771
'But what am I to do?' said Alice.'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and

1001
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:49,461
began whistling.

1002
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:54,681
'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,'said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly

1003
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:59,302
idiotic!'And she opened the door and went in.

1004
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:03,832
The door led right into a large kitchen,which was full of smoke from one end to the

1005
01:09:03,832 --> 01:09:08,842
other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby;

1006
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:10,612
the cook was leaning over the fire,

1007
01:09:10,612 --> 01:09:13,582
stirring a large cauldron which seemed tobe full of soup.

1008
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:17,772
'There's certainly too much pepper in thatsoup!'

1009
01:09:17,772 --> 01:09:22,342
Alice said to herself, as well as she couldfor sneezing.

1010
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,612
There was certainly too much of it in theair.

1011
01:09:24,612 --> 01:09:29,552
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; andas for the baby, it was sneezing and

1012
01:09:29,552 --> 01:09:33,242
howling alternately without a moment'spause.

1013
01:09:33,242 --> 01:09:37,902
The only things in the kitchen that did notsneeze, were the cook, and a large cat

1014
01:09:37,902 --> 01:09:43,582
which was sitting on the hearth andgrinning from ear to ear.

1015
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:48,362
'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, alittle timidly, for she was not quite sure

1016
01:09:48,362 --> 01:09:53,582
whether it was good manners for her tospeak first, 'why your cat grins like

1017
01:09:53,582 --> 01:09:55,742
that?'

1018
01:09:55,742 --> 01:09:59,222
'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess,'and that's why.

1019
01:09:59,222 --> 01:10:01,312
Pig!'

1020
01:10:01,312 --> 01:10:05,962
She said the last word with such suddenviolence that Alice quite jumped; but she

1021
01:10:05,962 --> 01:10:10,832
saw in another moment that it was addressedto the baby, and not to her, so she took

1022
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,052
courage, and went on again:--

1023
01:10:14,052 --> 01:10:19,102
'I didn't know that Cheshire cats alwaysgrinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats

1024
01:10:19,102 --> 01:10:24,072
COULD grin.''They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most

1025
01:10:24,072 --> 01:10:26,182
of 'em do.'

1026
01:10:26,182 --> 01:10:30,832
'I don't know of any that do,' Alice saidvery politely, feeling quite pleased to

1027
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:35,952
have got into a conversation.'You don't know much,' said the Duchess;

1028
01:10:35,952 --> 01:10:38,962
'and that's a fact.'

1029
01:10:38,962 --> 01:10:43,212
Alice did not at all like the tone of thisremark, and thought it would be as well to

1030
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:46,162
introduce some other subject ofconversation.

1031
01:10:46,162 --> 01:10:50,562
While she was trying to fix on one, thecook took the cauldron of soup off the

1032
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:55,662
fire, and at once set to work throwingeverything within her reach at the Duchess

1033
01:10:55,662 --> 01:10:58,412
and the baby--the fire-irons came first;

1034
01:10:58,412 --> 01:11:02,472
then followed a shower of saucepans,plates, and dishes.

1035
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:06,482
The Duchess took no notice of them evenwhen they hit her; and the baby was howling

1036
01:11:06,482 --> 01:11:10,332
so much already, that it was quiteimpossible to say whether the blows hurt it

1037
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:10,622
or not.

1038
01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:16,992
'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' criedAlice, jumping up and down in an agony of

1039
01:11:16,992 --> 01:11:17,662
terror.

1040
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:24,452
'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as anunusually large saucepan flew close by it,

1041
01:11:24,452 --> 01:11:27,632
and very nearly carried it off.

1042
01:11:27,632 --> 01:11:32,952
'If everybody minded their own business,'the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, 'the

1043
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:38,032
world would go round a deal faster than itdoes.'

1044
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:42,142
'Which would NOT be an advantage,' saidAlice, who felt very glad to get an

1045
01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:45,282
opportunity of showing off a little of herknowledge.

1046
01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:48,252
'Just think of what work it would make withthe day and night!

1047
01:11:48,252 --> 01:11:52,932
You see the earth takes twenty-four hoursto turn round on its axis--'

1048
01:11:52,932 --> 01:11:57,872
'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chopoff her head!'

1049
01:11:57,872 --> 01:12:02,412
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook,to see if she meant to take the hint; but

1050
01:12:02,412 --> 01:12:07,312
the cook was busily stirring the soup, andseemed not to be listening, so she went on

1051
01:12:07,312 --> 01:12:11,852
again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or isit twelve?

1052
01:12:11,852 --> 01:12:15,882
I--''Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I

1053
01:12:15,882 --> 01:12:18,292
never could abide figures!'

1054
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:23,242
And with that she began nursing her childagain, singing a sort of lullaby to it as

1055
01:12:23,242 --> 01:12:27,112
she did so, and giving it a violent shakeat the end of every line:

1056
01:12:27,112 --> 01:12:32,392
'Speak roughly to your little boy,And beat him when he sneezes:

1057
01:12:32,392 --> 01:12:37,072
He only does it to annoy,Because he knows it teases.'

1058
01:12:37,072 --> 01:12:40,392
CHORUS.(In which the cook and the baby joined):

1059
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:45,292
'Wow! wow! wow!'

1060
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:49,112
While the Duchess sang the second verse ofthe song, she kept tossing the baby

1061
01:12:49,112 --> 01:12:53,502
violently up and down, and the poor littlething howled so, that Alice could hardly

1062
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,272
hear the words:--

1063
01:12:54,272 --> 01:12:59,102
'I speak severely to my boy,I beat him when he sneezes;

1064
01:12:59,102 --> 01:13:02,712
For he can thoroughly enjoyThe pepper when he pleases!'

1065
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:08,542
CHORUS.'Wow! wow! wow!'

1066
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:12,452
'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if youlike!' the Duchess said to Alice, flinging

1067
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:14,022
the baby at her as she spoke.

1068
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:19,192
'I must go and get ready to play croquetwith the Queen,' and she hurried out of the

1069
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:22,402
room.The cook threw a frying-pan after her as

1070
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:27,332
she went out, but it just missed her.

1071
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:31,442
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty,as it was a queer-shaped little creature,

1072
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:36,352
and held out its arms and legs in alldirections, 'just like a star-fish,'

1073
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:37,792
thought Alice.

1074
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:41,552
The poor little thing was snorting like asteam-engine when she caught it, and kept

1075
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:45,872
doubling itself up and straightening itselfout again, so that altogether, for the

1076
01:13:45,872 --> 01:13:51,142
first minute or two, it was as much as shecould do to hold it.

1077
01:13:51,142 --> 01:13:55,822
As soon as she had made out the proper wayof nursing it, (which was to twist it up

1078
01:13:55,822 --> 01:14:01,262
into a sort of knot, and then keep tighthold of its right ear and left foot, so as

1079
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:06,592
to prevent its undoing itself,) she carriedit out into the open air.

1080
01:14:06,592 --> 01:14:11,042
'IF I don't take this child away with me,'thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in

1081
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:16,022
a day or two: wouldn't it be murder toleave it behind?'

1082
01:14:16,022 --> 01:14:20,982
She said the last words out loud, and thelittle thing grunted in reply (it had left

1083
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:25,802
off sneezing by this time).'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at

1084
01:14:25,802 --> 01:14:29,762
all a proper way of expressing yourself.'

1085
01:14:29,762 --> 01:14:34,102
The baby grunted again, and Alice lookedvery anxiously into its face to see what

1086
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,552
was the matter with it.

1087
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:41,402
There could be no doubt that it had a VERYturn-up nose, much more like a snout than a

1088
01:14:41,402 --> 01:14:47,092
real nose; also its eyes were gettingextremely small for a baby: altogether

1089
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:51,172
Alice did not like the look of the thing atall.

1090
01:14:51,172 --> 01:14:55,842
'But perhaps it was only sobbing,' shethought, and looked into its eyes again, to

1091
01:14:55,842 --> 01:14:58,942
see if there were any tears.

1092
01:14:58,942 --> 01:15:02,962
No, there were no tears.'If you're going to turn into a pig, my

1093
01:15:02,962 --> 01:15:06,672
dear,' said Alice, seriously, 'I'll havenothing more to do with you.

1094
01:15:06,672 --> 01:15:08,522
Mind now!'

1095
01:15:08,522 --> 01:15:13,572
The poor little thing sobbed again (orgrunted, it was impossible to say which),

1096
01:15:13,572 --> 01:15:18,882
and they went on for some while in silence.

1097
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:23,902
Alice was just beginning to think toherself, 'Now, what am I to do with this

1098
01:15:23,902 --> 01:15:28,632
creature when I get it home?' when itgrunted again, so violently, that she

1099
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:31,572
looked down into its face in some alarm.

1100
01:15:31,572 --> 01:15:35,602
This time there could be NO mistake aboutit: it was neither more nor less than a

1101
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:41,602
pig, and she felt that it would be quiteabsurd for her to carry it further.

1102
01:15:41,602 --> 01:15:45,522
So she set the little creature down, andfelt quite relieved to see it trot away

1103
01:15:45,522 --> 01:15:47,632
quietly into the wood.

1104
01:15:47,632 --> 01:15:52,952
'If it had grown up,' she said to herself,'it would have made a dreadfully ugly

1105
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:57,212
child: but it makes rather a handsome pig,I think.'

1106
01:15:57,212 --> 01:16:02,542
And she began thinking over other childrenshe knew, who might do very well as pigs,

1107
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:08,272
and was just saying to herself, 'if oneonly knew the right way to change them--'

1108
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,132
when she was a little startled by seeing

1109
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:14,982
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of atree a few yards off.

1110
01:16:14,982 --> 01:16:17,472
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.

1111
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:22,532
It looked good-natured, she thought: stillit had VERY long claws and a great many

1112
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:27,342
teeth, so she felt that it ought to betreated with respect.

1113
01:16:27,342 --> 01:16:32,712
'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly,as she did not at all know whether it would

1114
01:16:32,712 --> 01:16:37,222
like the name: however, it only grinned alittle wider.

1115
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:42,092
'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice,and she went on.

1116
01:16:42,092 --> 01:16:47,132
'Would you tell me, please, which way Iought to go from here?'

1117
01:16:47,132 --> 01:16:50,252
'That depends a good deal on where you wantto get to,' said the Cat.

1118
01:16:50,252 --> 01:16:57,762
'I don't much care where--' said Alice.'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,'

1119
01:16:57,762 --> 01:16:59,382
said the Cat.

1120
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:03,272
'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice addedas an explanation.

1121
01:17:03,272 --> 01:17:10,382
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat,'if you only walk long enough.'

1122
01:17:10,382 --> 01:17:14,192
Alice felt that this could not be denied,so she tried another question.

1123
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:19,132
'What sort of people live about here?'

1124
01:17:19,132 --> 01:17:24,732
'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, wavingits right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and

1125
01:17:24,732 --> 01:17:29,382
in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,'lives a March Hare.

1126
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:34,492
Visit either you like: they're both mad.'

1127
01:17:34,492 --> 01:17:37,492
'But I don't want to go among mad people,'Alice remarked.

1128
01:17:37,492 --> 01:17:42,152
'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:'we're all mad here.

1129
01:17:42,152 --> 01:17:43,361
I'm mad.

1130
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:47,952
You're mad.''How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.

1131
01:17:47,952 --> 01:17:52,832
'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or youwouldn't have come here.'

1132
01:17:52,832 --> 01:17:58,242
Alice didn't think that proved it at all;however, she went on 'And how do you know

1133
01:17:58,242 --> 01:18:03,602
that you're mad?''To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not

1134
01:18:03,602 --> 01:18:04,312
mad.

1135
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:10,252
You grant that?''I suppose so,' said Alice.

1136
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:15,042
'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, adog growls when it's angry, and wags its

1137
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:16,352
tail when it's pleased.

1138
01:18:16,352 --> 01:18:20,832
Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag mytail when I'm angry.

1139
01:18:20,832 --> 01:18:26,952
Therefore I'm mad.''I call it purring, not growling,' said

1140
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,172
Alice.

1141
01:18:28,172 --> 01:18:31,832
'Call it what you like,' said the Cat.'Do you play croquet with the Queen to-

1142
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:35,692
day?''I should like it very much,' said Alice,

1143
01:18:35,692 --> 01:18:38,912
'but I haven't been invited yet.'

1144
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:43,732
'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, andvanished.

1145
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:47,732
Alice was not much surprised at this, shewas getting so used to queer things

1146
01:18:47,732 --> 01:18:48,972
happening.

1147
01:18:48,972 --> 01:18:54,762
While she was looking at the place where ithad been, it suddenly appeared again.

1148
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:58,342
'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' saidthe Cat.

1149
01:18:58,342 --> 01:19:01,772
'I'd nearly forgotten to ask.'

1150
01:19:01,772 --> 01:19:07,442
'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said,just as if it had come back in a natural

1151
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:11,192
way.'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and

1152
01:19:11,192 --> 01:19:13,432
vanished again.

1153
01:19:13,432 --> 01:19:17,861
Alice waited a little, half expecting tosee it again, but it did not appear, and

1154
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:22,171
after a minute or two she walked on in thedirection in which the March Hare was said

1155
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:24,002
to live.

1156
01:19:24,002 --> 01:19:28,462
'I've seen hatters before,' she said toherself; 'the March Hare will be much the

1157
01:19:28,462 --> 01:19:34,812
most interesting, and perhaps as this isMay it won't be raving mad--at least not so

1158
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:38,512
mad as it was in March.'

1159
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:43,192
As she said this, she looked up, and therewas the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a

1160
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:47,962
tree.'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.

1161
01:19:47,962 --> 01:19:53,802
'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wishyou wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing

1162
01:19:53,802 --> 01:19:57,582
so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'

1163
01:19:57,582 --> 01:20:02,402
'All right,' said the Cat; and this time itvanished quite slowly, beginning with the

1164
01:20:02,402 --> 01:20:07,722
end of the tail, and ending with the grin,which remained some time after the rest of

1165
01:20:07,722 --> 01:20:11,022
it had gone.

1166
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:13,212
'Well!I've often seen a cat without a grin,'

1167
01:20:13,212 --> 01:20:18,582
thought Alice; 'but a grin without a cat!It's the most curious thing I ever saw in

1168
01:20:18,582 --> 01:20:21,082
my life!'

1169
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:25,022
She had not gone much farther before shecame in sight of the house of the March

1170
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:29,012
Hare: she thought it must be the righthouse, because the chimneys were shaped

1171
01:20:29,012 --> 01:20:32,312
like ears and the roof was thatched withfur.

1172
01:20:32,312 --> 01:20:36,622
It was so large a house, that she did notlike to go nearer till she had nibbled some

1173
01:20:36,622 --> 01:20:42,322
more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, andraised herself to about two feet high: even

1174
01:20:42,322 --> 01:20:44,182
then she walked up towards it rather

1175
01:20:44,182 --> 01:20:50,262
timidly, saying to herself 'Suppose itshould be raving mad after all!

1176
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:58,832
I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatterinstead!'

1177
01:20:58,832 --> 01:20:59,832
>

1178
01:20:59,832 --> 01:21:06,211
Chapter VII. A Mad Tea-Party

1179
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:11,942
There was a table set out under a tree infront of the house, and the March Hare and

1180
01:21:11,942 --> 01:21:15,992
the Hatter were having tea at it: aDormouse was sitting between them, fast

1181
01:21:15,992 --> 01:21:18,532
asleep, and the other two were using it as

1182
01:21:18,532 --> 01:21:22,122
a cushion, resting their elbows on it, andtalking over its head.

1183
01:21:22,122 --> 01:21:27,562
'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,'thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I

1184
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:30,872
suppose it doesn't mind.'

1185
01:21:30,872 --> 01:21:35,302
The table was a large one, but the threewere all crowded together at one corner of

1186
01:21:35,302 --> 01:21:38,312
it: 'No room!No room!' they cried out when they saw

1187
01:21:38,312 --> 01:21:39,062
Alice coming.

1188
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:44,492
'There's PLENTY of room!' said Aliceindignantly, and she sat down in a large

1189
01:21:44,492 --> 01:21:50,222
arm-chair at one end of the table.'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an

1190
01:21:50,222 --> 01:21:52,712
encouraging tone.

1191
01:21:52,712 --> 01:21:56,362
Alice looked all round the table, but therewas nothing on it but tea.

1192
01:21:56,362 --> 01:22:02,112
'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.

1193
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:07,142
'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offerit,' said Alice angrily.

1194
01:22:07,142 --> 01:22:11,182
'It wasn't very civil of you to sit downwithout being invited,' said the March

1195
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:11,182
Hare.

1196
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:16,761
'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' saidAlice; 'it's laid for a great many more

1197
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:22,002
than three.''Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.

1198
01:22:22,002 --> 01:22:25,981
He had been looking at Alice for some timewith great curiosity, and this was his

1199
01:22:25,981 --> 01:22:28,311
first speech.

1200
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:33,121
'You should learn not to make personalremarks,' Alice said with some severity;

1201
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:36,002
'it's very rude.'

1202
01:22:36,002 --> 01:22:42,602
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide onhearing this; but all he SAID was, 'Why is

1203
01:22:42,602 --> 01:22:48,352
a raven like a writing-desk?''Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought

1204
01:22:48,352 --> 01:22:48,481
Alice.

1205
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:53,471
'I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added

1206
01:22:53,471 --> 01:22:56,871
aloud.'Do you mean that you think you can find

1207
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:00,121
out the answer to it?' said the March Hare.

1208
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:04,681
'Exactly so,' said Alice.'Then you should say what you mean,' the

1209
01:23:04,681 --> 01:23:06,771
March Hare went on.

1210
01:23:06,771 --> 01:23:13,431
'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same

1211
01:23:13,431 --> 01:23:17,161
thing, you know.''Not the same thing a bit!' said the

1212
01:23:17,161 --> 01:23:17,571
Hatter.

1213
01:23:17,571 --> 01:23:22,931
'You might just as well say that "I seewhat I eat" is the same thing as "I eat

1214
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,002
what I see"!'

1215
01:23:25,002 --> 01:23:30,431
'You might just as well say,' added theMarch Hare, 'that "I like what I get" is

1216
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:34,262
the same thing as "I get what I like"!'

1217
01:23:34,262 --> 01:23:38,661
'You might just as well say,' added theDormouse, who seemed to be talking in his

1218
01:23:38,661 --> 01:23:44,482
sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" isthe same thing as "I sleep when I

1219
01:23:44,482 --> 01:23:45,062
breathe"!'

1220
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:51,381
'It IS the same thing with you,' said theHatter, and here the conversation dropped,

1221
01:23:51,381 --> 01:23:55,821
and the party sat silent for a minute,while Alice thought over all she could

1222
01:23:55,821 --> 01:24:01,851
remember about ravens and writing-desks,which wasn't much.

1223
01:24:01,851 --> 01:24:03,711
The Hatter was the first to break thesilence.

1224
01:24:03,711 --> 01:24:09,271
'What day of the month is it?' he said,turning to Alice: he had taken his watch

1225
01:24:09,271 --> 01:24:13,812
out of his pocket, and was looking at ituneasily, shaking it every now and then,

1226
01:24:13,812 --> 01:24:16,862
and holding it to his ear.

1227
01:24:16,862 --> 01:24:21,782
Alice considered a little, and then said'The fourth.'

1228
01:24:21,782 --> 01:24:23,771
'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.

1229
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:28,702
'I told you butter wouldn't suit theworks!' he added looking angrily at the

1230
01:24:28,702 --> 01:24:33,211
March Hare.'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare

1231
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:35,952
meekly replied.

1232
01:24:35,952 --> 01:24:40,482
'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in aswell,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't

1233
01:24:40,482 --> 01:24:43,901
have put it in with the bread-knife.'

1234
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:48,222
The March Hare took the watch and looked atit gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup

1235
01:24:48,222 --> 01:24:52,241
of tea, and looked at it again: but hecould think of nothing better to say than

1236
01:24:52,241 --> 01:24:57,982
his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,you know.'

1237
01:24:57,982 --> 01:25:01,571
Alice had been looking over his shoulderwith some curiosity.

1238
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,721
'What a funny watch!' she remarked.

1239
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:07,452
'It tells the day of the month, and doesn'ttell what o'clock it is!'

1240
01:25:07,452 --> 01:25:15,101
'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.'Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?'

1241
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:19,182
'Of course not,' Alice replied veryreadily: 'but that's because it stays the

1242
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:24,972
same year for such a long time together.''Which is just the case with MINE,' said

1243
01:25:24,972 --> 01:25:27,242
the Hatter.

1244
01:25:27,242 --> 01:25:31,022
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort

1245
01:25:31,022 --> 01:25:35,272
of meaning in it, and yet it was certainlyEnglish.

1246
01:25:35,272 --> 01:25:41,302
'I don't quite understand you,' she said,as politely as she could.

1247
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:45,672
'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said theHatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon

1248
01:25:45,672 --> 01:25:47,892
its nose.

1249
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:53,192
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently,and said, without opening its eyes, 'Of

1250
01:25:53,192 --> 01:25:57,932
course, of course; just what I was going toremark myself.'

1251
01:25:57,932 --> 01:26:02,592
'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' theHatter said, turning to Alice again.

1252
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:07,182
'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what'sthe answer?'

1253
01:26:07,182 --> 01:26:09,332
'I haven't the slightest idea,' said theHatter.

1254
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:14,952
'Nor I,' said the March Hare.Alice sighed wearily.

1255
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:20,742
'I think you might do something better withthe time,' she said, 'than waste it in

1256
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,812
asking riddles that have no answers.'

1257
01:26:22,812 --> 01:26:28,862
'If you knew Time as well as I do,' saidthe Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk about

1258
01:26:28,862 --> 01:26:30,942
wasting IT.It's HIM.'

1259
01:26:30,942 --> 01:26:34,482
'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.

1260
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:39,652
'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said,tossing his head contemptuously.

1261
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:43,412
'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'

1262
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:47,742
'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:'but I know I have to beat time when I

1263
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:51,772
learn music.''Ah! that accounts for it,' said the

1264
01:26:51,772 --> 01:26:52,292
Hatter.

1265
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:55,972
'He won't stand beating.Now, if you only kept on good terms with

1266
01:26:55,972 --> 01:26:59,192
him, he'd do almost anything you liked withthe clock.

1267
01:26:59,192 --> 01:27:04,912
For instance, suppose it were nine o'clockin the morning, just time to begin lessons:

1268
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:10,102
you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time,and round goes the clock in a twinkling!

1269
01:27:10,102 --> 01:27:11,392
Half-past one, time for dinner!'

1270
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:16,522
('I only wish it was,' the March Hare saidto itself in a whisper.)

1271
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:22,652
'That would be grand, certainly,' saidAlice thoughtfully: 'but then--I shouldn't

1272
01:27:22,652 --> 01:27:26,172
be hungry for it, you know.'

1273
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:30,492
'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:'but you could keep it to half-past one as

1274
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:34,242
long as you liked.''Is that the way YOU manage?'

1275
01:27:34,242 --> 01:27:36,292
Alice asked.

1276
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:40,422
The Hatter shook his head mournfully.'Not I!' he replied.

1277
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:45,382
'We quarrelled last March--just before HEwent mad, you know--' (pointing with his

1278
01:27:45,382 --> 01:27:49,742
tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was atthe great concert given by the Queen of

1279
01:27:49,742 --> 01:27:51,242
Hearts, and I had to sing

1280
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:57,092
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!How I wonder what you're at!"

1281
01:27:57,092 --> 01:28:02,692
You know the song, perhaps?''I've heard something like it,' said Alice.

1282
01:28:02,692 --> 01:28:05,432
'It goes on, you know,' the Hattercontinued, 'in this way:--

1283
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:10,342
"Up above the world you fly,Like a tea-tray in the sky.

1284
01:28:10,342 --> 01:28:13,472
Twinkle, twinkle--"'

1285
01:28:13,472 --> 01:28:19,122
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and begansinging in its sleep 'Twinkle, twinkle,

1286
01:28:19,122 --> 01:28:25,952
twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so longthat they had to pinch it to make it stop.

1287
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:29,802
'Well, I'd hardly finished the firstverse,' said the Hatter, 'when the Queen

1288
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:33,522
jumped up and bawled out, "He's murderingthe time!

1289
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:35,912
Off with his head!"'

1290
01:28:35,912 --> 01:28:42,222
'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on

1291
01:28:42,222 --> 01:28:45,452
in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing Iask!

1292
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:47,202
It's always six o'clock now.'

1293
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:54,382
A bright idea came into Alice's head.'Is that the reason so many tea-things are

1294
01:28:54,382 --> 01:28:56,662
put out here?' she asked.

1295
01:28:56,662 --> 01:29:00,832
'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with asigh: 'it's always tea-time, and we've no

1296
01:29:00,832 --> 01:29:07,132
time to wash the things between whiles.''Then you keep moving round, I suppose?'

1297
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:08,742
said Alice.

1298
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:13,792
'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as thethings get used up.'

1299
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:16,452
'But what happens when you come to thebeginning again?'

1300
01:29:16,452 --> 01:29:17,882
Alice ventured to ask.

1301
01:29:17,882 --> 01:29:22,232
'Suppose we change the subject,' the MarchHare interrupted, yawning.

1302
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:27,612
'I'm getting tired of this.I vote the young lady tells us a story.'

1303
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:31,412
'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice,rather alarmed at the proposal.

1304
01:29:31,412 --> 01:29:36,332
'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.'Wake up, Dormouse!'

1305
01:29:36,332 --> 01:29:40,352
And they pinched it on both sides at once.

1306
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:45,422
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a hoarse,

1307
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:50,852
feeble voice: 'I heard every word youfellows were saying.'

1308
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:53,302
'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

1309
01:29:53,302 --> 01:29:58,532
'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter,

1310
01:29:58,532 --> 01:30:00,532
'or you'll be asleep again before it'sdone.'

1311
01:30:00,532 --> 01:30:07,092
'Once upon a time there were three littlesisters,' the Dormouse began in a great

1312
01:30:07,092 --> 01:30:11,982
hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie,and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of

1313
01:30:11,982 --> 01:30:14,132
a well--'

1314
01:30:14,132 --> 01:30:18,442
'What did they live on?' said Alice, whoalways took a great interest in questions

1315
01:30:18,442 --> 01:30:23,612
of eating and drinking.'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse,

1316
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:24,962
after thinking a minute or two.

1317
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:30,342
'They couldn't have done that, you know,'Alice gently remarked; 'they'd have been

1318
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:34,472
ill.''So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY

1319
01:30:34,472 --> 01:30:36,742
ill.'

1320
01:30:36,742 --> 01:30:40,452
Alice tried to fancy to herself what suchan extraordinary ways of living would be

1321
01:30:40,452 --> 01:30:45,482
like, but it puzzled her too much, so shewent on: 'But why did they live at the

1322
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,982
bottom of a well?'

1323
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:52,192
'Take some more tea,' the March Hare saidto Alice, very earnestly.

1324
01:30:52,192 --> 01:30:58,312
'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in anoffended tone, 'so I can't take more.'

1325
01:30:58,312 --> 01:31:03,012
'You mean you can't take LESS,' said theHatter: 'it's very easy to take MORE than

1326
01:31:03,012 --> 01:31:07,022
nothing.''Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

1327
01:31:07,022 --> 01:31:13,332
'Who's making personal remarks now?' theHatter asked triumphantly.

1328
01:31:13,332 --> 01:31:17,322
Alice did not quite know what to say tothis: so she helped herself to some tea and

1329
01:31:17,322 --> 01:31:21,892
bread-and-butter, and then turned to theDormouse, and repeated her question.

1330
01:31:21,892 --> 01:31:25,712
'Why did they live at the bottom of awell?'

1331
01:31:25,712 --> 01:31:30,912
The Dormouse again took a minute or two tothink about it, and then said, 'It was a

1332
01:31:30,912 --> 01:31:31,902
treacle-well.'

1333
01:31:31,902 --> 01:31:34,852
'There's no such thing!'

1334
01:31:34,852 --> 01:31:40,382
Alice was beginning very angrily, but theHatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!'

1335
01:31:40,382 --> 01:31:45,812
and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If youcan't be civil, you'd better finish the

1336
01:31:45,812 --> 01:31:48,222
story for yourself.'

1337
01:31:48,222 --> 01:31:51,582
'No, please go on!'Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt

1338
01:31:51,582 --> 01:31:54,902
again.I dare say there may be ONE.'

1339
01:31:54,902 --> 01:31:57,442
'One, indeed!' said the Dormouseindignantly.

1340
01:31:57,442 --> 01:32:03,712
However, he consented to go on.'And so these three little sisters--they

1341
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,132
were learning to draw, you know--'

1342
01:32:05,132 --> 01:32:09,582
'What did they draw?' said Alice, quiteforgetting her promise.

1343
01:32:09,582 --> 01:32:16,152
'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, withoutconsidering at all this time.

1344
01:32:16,152 --> 01:32:21,442
'I want a clean cup,' interrupted theHatter: 'let's all move one place on.'

1345
01:32:21,442 --> 01:32:26,452
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormousefollowed him: the March Hare moved into the

1346
01:32:26,452 --> 01:32:30,852
Dormouse's place, and Alice ratherunwillingly took the place of the March

1347
01:32:30,852 --> 01:32:31,852
Hare.

1348
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:35,932
The Hatter was the only one who got anyadvantage from the change: and Alice was a

1349
01:32:35,932 --> 01:32:40,882
good deal worse off than before, as theMarch Hare had just upset the milk-jug into

1350
01:32:40,882 --> 01:32:43,382
his plate.

1351
01:32:43,382 --> 01:32:48,822
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouseagain, so she began very cautiously: 'But I

1352
01:32:48,822 --> 01:32:54,212
don't understand.Where did they draw the treacle from?'

1353
01:32:54,212 --> 01:32:58,272
'You can draw water out of a water-well,'said the Hatter; 'so I should think you

1354
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:02,902
could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'

1355
01:33:02,902 --> 01:33:08,052
'But they were IN the well,' Alice said tothe Dormouse, not choosing to notice this

1356
01:33:08,052 --> 01:33:12,332
last remark.'Of course they were', said the Dormouse;

1357
01:33:12,332 --> 01:33:14,752
'--well in.'

1358
01:33:14,752 --> 01:33:19,402
This answer so confused poor Alice, thatshe let the Dormouse go on for some time

1359
01:33:19,402 --> 01:33:21,602
without interrupting it.

1360
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:25,982
'They were learning to draw,' the Dormousewent on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for

1361
01:33:25,982 --> 01:33:31,162
it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drewall manner of things--everything that

1362
01:33:31,162 --> 01:33:33,262
begins with an M--'

1363
01:33:33,262 --> 01:33:39,992
'Why with an M?' said Alice.'Why not?' said the March Hare.

1364
01:33:39,992 --> 01:33:42,352
Alice was silent.

1365
01:33:42,352 --> 01:33:46,892
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by thistime, and was going off into a doze; but,

1366
01:33:46,892 --> 01:33:52,052
on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke upagain with a little shriek, and went on: '-

1367
01:33:52,052 --> 01:33:54,442
-that begins with an M, such as mouse-

1368
01:33:54,442 --> 01:34:00,062
traps, and the moon, and memory, andmuchness--you know you say things are "much

1369
01:34:00,062 --> 01:34:06,202
of a muchness"--did you ever see such athing as a drawing of a muchness?'

1370
01:34:06,202 --> 01:34:10,902
'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, verymuch confused, 'I don't think--'

1371
01:34:10,902 --> 01:34:15,382
'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.

1372
01:34:15,382 --> 01:34:20,272
This piece of rudeness was more than Alicecould bear: she got up in great disgust,

1373
01:34:20,272 --> 01:34:24,702
and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleepinstantly, and neither of the others took

1374
01:34:24,702 --> 01:34:27,042
the least notice of her going, though she

1375
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:31,692
looked back once or twice, half hoping thatthey would call after her: the last time

1376
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:36,462
she saw them, they were trying to put theDormouse into the teapot.

1377
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:40,732
'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!'said Alice as she picked her way through

1378
01:34:40,732 --> 01:34:44,392
the wood.'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at

1379
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:47,082
in all my life!'

1380
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:51,162
Just as she said this, she noticed that oneof the trees had a door leading right into

1381
01:34:51,162 --> 01:34:54,472
it.'That's very curious!' she thought.

1382
01:34:54,472 --> 01:34:56,372
'But everything's curious today.

1383
01:34:56,372 --> 01:35:02,062
I think I may as well go in at once.'And in she went.

1384
01:35:02,062 --> 01:35:07,792
Once more she found herself in the longhall, and close to the little glass table.

1385
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:12,472
'Now, I'll manage better this time,' shesaid to herself, and began by taking the

1386
01:35:12,472 --> 01:35:16,472
little golden key, and unlocking the doorthat led into the garden.

1387
01:35:16,472 --> 01:35:20,731
Then she went to work nibbling at themushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her

1388
01:35:20,731 --> 01:35:26,102
pocket) till she was about a foot high:then she walked down the little passage:

1389
01:35:26,102 --> 01:35:29,611
and THEN--she found herself at last in the

1390
01:35:29,611 --> 01:35:38,832
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.

1391
01:35:38,832 --> 01:35:39,832
>

1392
01:35:39,832 --> 01:35:49,372
Chapter VIII. The Queen's Croquet-GroundA large rose-tree stood near the entrance

1393
01:35:49,372 --> 01:35:53,782
of the garden: the roses growing on it werewhite, but there were three gardeners at

1394
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:56,512
it, busily painting them red.

1395
01:35:56,512 --> 01:36:00,892
Alice thought this a very curious thing,and she went nearer to watch them, and just

1396
01:36:00,892 --> 01:36:05,222
as she came up to them she heard one ofthem say, 'Look out now, Five!

1397
01:36:05,222 --> 01:36:07,382
Don't go splashing paint over me likethat!'

1398
01:36:07,382 --> 01:36:14,452
'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulkytone; 'Seven jogged my elbow.'

1399
01:36:14,452 --> 01:36:18,122
On which Seven looked up and said, 'That'sright, Five!

1400
01:36:18,122 --> 01:36:23,161
Always lay the blame on others!''YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.

1401
01:36:23,161 --> 01:36:27,402
'I heard the Queen say only yesterday youdeserved to be beheaded!'

1402
01:36:27,402 --> 01:36:30,821
'What for?' said the one who had spokenfirst.

1403
01:36:30,821 --> 01:36:34,502
'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' saidSeven.

1404
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:39,071
'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'andI'll tell him--it was for bringing the cook

1405
01:36:39,071 --> 01:36:42,792
tulip-roots instead of onions.'

1406
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:48,112
Seven flung down his brush, and had justbegun 'Well, of all the unjust things--'

1407
01:36:48,112 --> 01:36:52,872
when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, asshe stood watching them, and he checked

1408
01:36:52,872 --> 01:36:58,152
himself suddenly: the others looked roundalso, and all of them bowed low.

1409
01:36:58,152 --> 01:37:02,972
'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a littletimidly, 'why you are painting those

1410
01:37:02,972 --> 01:37:05,642
roses?'

1411
01:37:05,642 --> 01:37:08,712
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked atTwo.

1412
01:37:08,712 --> 01:37:14,352
Two began in a low voice, 'Why the fact is,you see, Miss, this here ought to have been

1413
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:19,362
a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one inby mistake; and if the Queen was to find it

1414
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:22,192
out, we should all have our heads cut off,you know.

1415
01:37:22,192 --> 01:37:28,212
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best,afore she comes, to--' At this moment Five,

1416
01:37:28,212 --> 01:37:32,012
who had been anxiously looking across thegarden, called out 'The Queen!

1417
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:36,802
The Queen!' and the three gardenersinstantly threw themselves flat upon their

1418
01:37:36,802 --> 01:37:39,771
faces.There was a sound of many footsteps, and

1419
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:44,002
Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

1420
01:37:44,002 --> 01:37:48,561
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs;these were all shaped like the three

1421
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:54,202
gardeners, oblong and flat, with theirhands and feet at the corners: next the ten

1422
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:56,622
courtiers; these were ornamented all over

1423
01:37:56,622 --> 01:38:02,002
with diamonds, and walked two and two, asthe soldiers did.

1424
01:38:02,002 --> 01:38:06,282
After these came the royal children; therewere ten of them, and the little dears came

1425
01:38:06,282 --> 01:38:11,172
jumping merrily along hand in hand, incouples: they were all ornamented with

1426
01:38:11,172 --> 01:38:12,732
hearts.

1427
01:38:12,732 --> 01:38:18,181
Next came the guests, mostly Kings andQueens, and among them Alice recognised the

1428
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:22,681
White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurriednervous manner, smiling at everything that

1429
01:38:22,681 --> 01:38:26,522
was said, and went by without noticing her.

1430
01:38:26,522 --> 01:38:30,892
Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carryingthe King's crown on a crimson velvet

1431
01:38:30,892 --> 01:38:35,882
cushion; and, last of all this grandprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF

1432
01:38:35,882 --> 01:38:38,431
HEARTS.

1433
01:38:38,431 --> 01:38:42,892
Alice was rather doubtful whether she oughtnot to lie down on her face like the three

1434
01:38:42,892 --> 01:38:47,532
gardeners, but she could not remember everhaving heard of such a rule at processions;

1435
01:38:47,532 --> 01:38:49,752
'and besides, what would be the use of a

1436
01:38:49,752 --> 01:38:54,752
procession,' thought she, 'if people hadall to lie down upon their faces, so that

1437
01:38:54,752 --> 01:38:58,571
they couldn't see it?'So she stood still where she was, and

1438
01:38:58,571 --> 01:39:01,052
waited.

1439
01:39:01,052 --> 01:39:05,802
When the procession came opposite to Alice,they all stopped and looked at her, and the

1440
01:39:05,802 --> 01:39:11,092
Queen said severely 'Who is this?'She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who

1441
01:39:11,092 --> 01:39:13,172
only bowed and smiled in reply.

1442
01:39:13,172 --> 01:39:19,972
'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her headimpatiently; and, turning to Alice, she

1443
01:39:19,972 --> 01:39:22,512
went on, 'What's your name, child?'

1444
01:39:22,512 --> 01:39:29,562
'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,'said Alice very politely; but she added, to

1445
01:39:29,562 --> 01:39:33,961
herself, 'Why, they're only a pack ofcards, after all.

1446
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:36,942
I needn't be afraid of them!'

1447
01:39:36,942 --> 01:39:40,862
'And who are THESE?' said the Queen,pointing to the three gardeners who were

1448
01:39:40,862 --> 01:39:45,482
lying round the rosetree; for, you see, asthey were lying on their faces, and the

1449
01:39:45,482 --> 01:39:47,372
pattern on their backs was the same as the

1450
01:39:47,372 --> 01:39:51,312
rest of the pack, she could not tellwhether they were gardeners, or soldiers,

1451
01:39:51,312 --> 01:39:57,552
or courtiers, or three of her own children.'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised

1452
01:39:57,552 --> 01:39:58,811
at her own courage.

1453
01:39:58,811 --> 01:40:04,512
'It's no business of MINE.'The Queen turned crimson with fury, and,

1454
01:40:04,512 --> 01:40:09,512
after glaring at her for a moment like awild beast, screamed 'Off with her head!

1455
01:40:09,512 --> 01:40:11,732
Off--'

1456
01:40:11,732 --> 01:40:17,772
'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly anddecidedly, and the Queen was silent.

1457
01:40:17,772 --> 01:40:22,882
The King laid his hand upon her arm, andtimidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is

1458
01:40:22,882 --> 01:40:25,442
only a child!'

1459
01:40:25,442 --> 01:40:29,602
The Queen turned angrily away from him, andsaid to the Knave 'Turn them over!'

1460
01:40:29,602 --> 01:40:32,932
The Knave did so, very carefully, with onefoot.

1461
01:40:32,932 --> 01:40:39,221
'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loudvoice, and the three gardeners instantly

1462
01:40:39,221 --> 01:40:43,482
jumped up, and began bowing to the King,the Queen, the royal children, and

1463
01:40:43,482 --> 01:40:45,582
everybody else.

1464
01:40:45,582 --> 01:40:48,902
'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.'You make me giddy.'

1465
01:40:48,902 --> 01:40:55,272
And then, turning to the rose-tree, shewent on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'

1466
01:40:55,272 --> 01:40:59,892
'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, ina very humble tone, going down on one knee

1467
01:40:59,892 --> 01:41:05,952
as he spoke, 'we were trying--''I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile

1468
01:41:05,952 --> 01:41:07,982
been examining the roses.

1469
01:41:07,982 --> 01:41:13,132
'Off with their heads!' and the processionmoved on, three of the soldiers remaining

1470
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:17,762
behind to execute the unfortunategardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.

1471
01:41:17,762 --> 01:41:23,922
'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, andshe put them into a large flower-pot that

1472
01:41:23,922 --> 01:41:25,432
stood near.

1473
01:41:25,432 --> 01:41:29,892
The three soldiers wandered about for aminute or two, looking for them, and then

1474
01:41:29,892 --> 01:41:37,132
quietly marched off after the others.'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.

1475
01:41:37,132 --> 01:41:41,871
'Their heads are gone, if it please yourMajesty!' the soldiers shouted in reply.

1476
01:41:41,871 --> 01:41:45,971
'That's right!' shouted the Queen.'Can you play croquet?'

1477
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:50,471
The soldiers were silent, and looked atAlice, as the question was evidently meant

1478
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:54,712
for her.'Yes!' shouted Alice.

1479
01:41:54,712 --> 01:41:59,901
'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, andAlice joined the procession, wondering very

1480
01:41:59,901 --> 01:42:06,362
much what would happen next.'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid

1481
01:42:06,362 --> 01:42:07,942
voice at her side.

1482
01:42:07,942 --> 01:42:13,112
She was walking by the White Rabbit, whowas peeping anxiously into her face.

1483
01:42:13,112 --> 01:42:15,151
'Very,' said Alice: '--where's theDuchess?'

1484
01:42:15,151 --> 01:42:15,971
'Hush!

1485
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:20,132
Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurriedtone.

1486
01:42:20,132 --> 01:42:24,901
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as hespoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe,

1487
01:42:24,901 --> 01:42:28,971
put his mouth close to her ear, andwhispered 'She's under sentence of

1488
01:42:28,971 --> 01:42:31,112
execution.'

1489
01:42:31,112 --> 01:42:34,762
'What for?' said Alice.'Did you say "What a pity!"

1490
01:42:34,762 --> 01:42:38,762
?' the Rabbit asked.'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think

1491
01:42:38,762 --> 01:42:40,091
it's at all a pity.

1492
01:42:40,091 --> 01:42:45,242
I said "What for?"''She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit

1493
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:49,042
began.Alice gave a little scream of laughter.

1494
01:42:49,042 --> 01:42:52,522
'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in afrightened tone.

1495
01:42:52,522 --> 01:42:55,721
'The Queen will hear you!You see, she came rather late, and the

1496
01:42:55,721 --> 01:42:56,031
Queen said--'

1497
01:42:56,031 --> 01:43:01,811
'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen ina voice of thunder, and people began

1498
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:06,332
running about in all directions, tumblingup against each other; however, they got

1499
01:43:06,332 --> 01:43:11,292
settled down in a minute or two, and thegame began.

1500
01:43:11,292 --> 01:43:16,221
Alice thought she had never seen such acurious croquet-ground in her life; it was

1501
01:43:16,221 --> 01:43:22,281
all ridges and furrows; the balls were livehedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and

1502
01:43:22,281 --> 01:43:24,192
the soldiers had to double themselves up

1503
01:43:24,192 --> 01:43:28,882
and to stand on their hands and feet, tomake the arches.

1504
01:43:28,882 --> 01:43:34,001
The chief difficulty Alice found at firstwas in managing her flamingo: she succeeded

1505
01:43:34,001 --> 01:43:38,001
in getting its body tucked away,comfortably enough, under her arm, with its

1506
01:43:38,001 --> 01:43:41,162
legs hanging down, but generally, just as

1507
01:43:41,162 --> 01:43:45,132
she had got its neck nicely straightenedout, and was going to give the hedgehog a

1508
01:43:45,132 --> 01:43:50,992
blow with its head, it WOULD twist itselfround and look up in her face, with such a

1509
01:43:50,992 --> 01:43:53,221
puzzled expression that she could not help

1510
01:43:53,221 --> 01:43:57,662
bursting out laughing: and when she had gotits head down, and was going to begin

1511
01:43:57,662 --> 01:44:02,841
again, it was very provoking to find thatthe hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was

1512
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:05,912
in the act of crawling away: besides all

1513
01:44:05,912 --> 01:44:10,632
this, there was generally a ridge or furrowin the way wherever she wanted to send the

1514
01:44:10,632 --> 01:44:15,192
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-upsoldiers were always getting up and walking

1515
01:44:15,192 --> 01:44:17,762
off to other parts of the ground, Alice

1516
01:44:17,762 --> 01:44:23,522
soon came to the conclusion that it was avery difficult game indeed.

1517
01:44:23,522 --> 01:44:27,512
The players all played at once withoutwaiting for turns, quarrelling all the

1518
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:32,132
while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; andin a very short time the Queen was in a

1519
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:35,132
furious passion, and went stamping about,

1520
01:44:35,132 --> 01:44:42,432
and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Offwith her head!' about once in a minute.

1521
01:44:42,432 --> 01:44:47,812
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to besure, she had not as yet had any dispute

1522
01:44:47,812 --> 01:44:53,652
with the Queen, but she knew that it mighthappen any minute, 'and then,' thought she,

1523
01:44:53,652 --> 01:44:55,022
'what would become of me?

1524
01:44:55,022 --> 01:44:59,502
They're dreadfully fond of beheading peoplehere; the great wonder is, that there's any

1525
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:02,101
one left alive!'

1526
01:45:02,101 --> 01:45:05,952
She was looking about for some way ofescape, and wondering whether she could get

1527
01:45:05,952 --> 01:45:11,242
away without being seen, when she noticed acurious appearance in the air: it puzzled

1528
01:45:11,242 --> 01:45:14,072
her very much at first, but, after watching

1529
01:45:14,072 --> 01:45:18,912
it a minute or two, she made it out to be agrin, and she said to herself 'It's the

1530
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:23,952
Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody totalk to.'

1531
01:45:23,952 --> 01:45:27,812
'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, assoon as there was mouth enough for it to

1532
01:45:27,812 --> 01:45:32,392
speak with.Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and

1533
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:34,402
then nodded.

1534
01:45:34,402 --> 01:45:38,582
'It's no use speaking to it,' she thought,'till its ears have come, or at least one

1535
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:40,611
of them.'

1536
01:45:40,611 --> 01:45:45,032
In another minute the whole head appeared,and then Alice put down her flamingo, and

1537
01:45:45,032 --> 01:45:50,062
began an account of the game, feeling veryglad she had someone to listen to her.

1538
01:45:50,062 --> 01:45:54,161
The Cat seemed to think that there wasenough of it now in sight, and no more of

1539
01:45:54,161 --> 01:45:56,652
it appeared.

1540
01:45:56,652 --> 01:46:02,192
'I don't think they play at all fairly,'Alice began, in rather a complaining tone,

1541
01:46:02,192 --> 01:46:06,782
'and they all quarrel so dreadfully onecan't hear oneself speak--and they don't

1542
01:46:06,782 --> 01:46:09,282
seem to have any rules in particular; at

1543
01:46:09,282 --> 01:46:14,222
least, if there are, nobody attends tothem--and you've no idea how confusing it

1544
01:46:14,222 --> 01:46:18,652
is all the things being alive; forinstance, there's the arch I've got to go

1545
01:46:18,652 --> 01:46:20,802
through next walking about at the other end

1546
01:46:20,802 --> 01:46:25,921
of the ground--and I should have croquetedthe Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran

1547
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:31,052
away when it saw mine coming!''How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat

1548
01:46:31,052 --> 01:46:33,432
in a low voice.

1549
01:46:33,432 --> 01:46:39,702
'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's soextremely--' Just then she noticed that the

1550
01:46:39,702 --> 01:46:45,062
Queen was close behind her, listening: soshe went on, '--likely to win, that it's

1551
01:46:45,062 --> 01:46:48,411
hardly worth while finishing the game.'

1552
01:46:48,411 --> 01:46:53,742
The Queen smiled and passed on.'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King,

1553
01:46:53,742 --> 01:46:59,111
going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat'shead with great curiosity.

1554
01:46:59,111 --> 01:47:03,231
'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,'said Alice: 'allow me to introduce it.'

1555
01:47:03,231 --> 01:47:09,272
'I don't like the look of it at all,' saidthe King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if

1556
01:47:09,272 --> 01:47:11,361
it likes.'

1557
01:47:11,361 --> 01:47:16,252
'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and

1558
01:47:16,252 --> 01:47:20,992
don't look at me like that!'He got behind Alice as he spoke.

1559
01:47:20,992 --> 01:47:23,202
'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.

1560
01:47:23,202 --> 01:47:27,762
'I've read that in some book, but I don'tremember where.'

1561
01:47:27,762 --> 01:47:32,202
'Well, it must be removed,' said the Kingvery decidedly, and he called the Queen,

1562
01:47:32,202 --> 01:47:34,702
who was passing at the moment, 'My dear!

1563
01:47:34,702 --> 01:47:40,772
I wish you would have this cat removed!'The Queen had only one way of settling all

1564
01:47:40,772 --> 01:47:45,452
difficulties, great or small.'Off with his head!' she said, without even

1565
01:47:45,452 --> 01:47:47,661
looking round.

1566
01:47:47,661 --> 01:47:53,502
'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' saidthe King eagerly, and he hurried off.

1567
01:47:53,502 --> 01:47:57,642
Alice thought she might as well go back,and see how the game was going on, as she

1568
01:47:57,642 --> 01:48:01,262
heard the Queen's voice in the distance,screaming with passion.

1569
01:48:01,262 --> 01:48:05,322
She had already heard her sentence three ofthe players to be executed for having

1570
01:48:05,322 --> 01:48:09,842
missed their turns, and she did not likethe look of things at all, as the game was

1571
01:48:09,842 --> 01:48:13,492
in such confusion that she never knewwhether it was her turn or not.

1572
01:48:13,492 --> 01:48:17,291
So she went in search of her hedgehog.

1573
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:21,822
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight withanother hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an

1574
01:48:21,822 --> 01:48:26,442
excellent opportunity for croqueting one ofthem with the other: the only difficulty

1575
01:48:26,442 --> 01:48:28,872
was, that her flamingo was gone across to

1576
01:48:28,872 --> 01:48:32,842
the other side of the garden, where Alicecould see it trying in a helpless sort of

1577
01:48:32,842 --> 01:48:36,101
way to fly up into a tree.

1578
01:48:36,101 --> 01:48:40,231
By the time she had caught the flamingo andbrought it back, the fight was over, and

1579
01:48:40,231 --> 01:48:46,052
both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'butit doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, 'as

1580
01:48:46,052 --> 01:48:49,892
all the arches are gone from this side ofthe ground.'

1581
01:48:49,892 --> 01:48:53,932
So she tucked it away under her arm, thatit might not escape again, and went back

1582
01:48:53,932 --> 01:48:57,692
for a little more conversation with herfriend.

1583
01:48:57,692 --> 01:49:02,132
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, shewas surprised to find quite a large crowd

1584
01:49:02,132 --> 01:49:06,692
collected round it: there was a disputegoing on between the executioner, the King,

1585
01:49:06,692 --> 01:49:08,592
and the Queen, who were all talking at

1586
01:49:08,592 --> 01:49:14,782
once, while all the rest were quite silent,and looked very uncomfortable.

1587
01:49:14,782 --> 01:49:19,632
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealedto by all three to settle the question, and

1588
01:49:19,632 --> 01:49:23,692
they repeated their arguments to her,though, as they all spoke at once, she

1589
01:49:23,692 --> 01:49:28,402
found it very hard indeed to make outexactly what they said.

1590
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:32,851
The executioner's argument was, that youcouldn't cut off a head unless there was a

1591
01:49:32,851 --> 01:49:37,592
body to cut it off from: that he had neverhad to do such a thing before, and he

1592
01:49:37,592 --> 01:49:42,052
wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.

1593
01:49:42,052 --> 01:49:46,791
The King's argument was, that anything thathad a head could be beheaded, and that you

1594
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:49,971
weren't to talk nonsense.

1595
01:49:49,971 --> 01:49:54,302
The Queen's argument was, that if somethingwasn't done about it in less than no time

1596
01:49:54,302 --> 01:49:59,762
she'd have everybody executed, all round.(It was this last remark that had made the

1597
01:49:59,762 --> 01:50:04,062
whole party look so grave and anxious.)

1598
01:50:04,062 --> 01:50:08,152
Alice could think of nothing else to saybut 'It belongs to the Duchess: you'd

1599
01:50:08,152 --> 01:50:12,541
better ask HER about it.''She's in prison,' the Queen said to the

1600
01:50:12,541 --> 01:50:15,752
executioner: 'fetch her here.'

1601
01:50:15,752 --> 01:50:19,772
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

1602
01:50:19,772 --> 01:50:24,611
The Cat's head began fading away the momenthe was gone, and, by the time he had come

1603
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:30,052
back with the Duchess, it had entirelydisappeared; so the King and the

1604
01:50:30,052 --> 01:50:32,332
executioner ran wildly up and down looking

1605
01:50:32,332 --> 01:50:40,832
for it, while the rest of the party wentback to the game.

1606
01:50:40,832 --> 01:50:41,832

1607
01:50:41,832 --> 01:50:49,681
Chapter IX. The Mock Turtle's Story

1608
01:50:49,681 --> 01:50:54,942
'You can't think how glad I am to see youagain, you dear old thing!' said the

1609
01:50:54,942 --> 01:50:59,031
Duchess, as she tucked her armaffectionately into Alice's, and they

1610
01:50:59,031 --> 01:51:02,052
walked off together.

1611
01:51:02,052 --> 01:51:06,341
Alice was very glad to find her in such apleasant temper, and thought to herself

1612
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:10,591
that perhaps it was only the pepper thathad made her so savage when they met in the

1613
01:51:10,591 --> 01:51:11,081
kitchen.

1614
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:18,252
'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself,(not in a very hopeful tone though), 'I

1615
01:51:18,252 --> 01:51:20,652
won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL.

1616
01:51:20,652 --> 01:51:25,612
Soup does very well without--Maybe it'salways pepper that makes people hot-

1617
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:30,781
tempered,' she went on, very much pleasedat having found out a new kind of rule,

1618
01:51:30,781 --> 01:51:33,531
'and vinegar that makes them sour--and

1619
01:51:33,531 --> 01:51:38,461
camomile that makes them bitter--and--andbarley-sugar and such things that make

1620
01:51:38,461 --> 01:51:42,191
children sweet-tempered.I only wish people knew that: then they

1621
01:51:42,191 --> 01:51:46,082
wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--'

1622
01:51:46,082 --> 01:51:49,792
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by thistime, and was a little startled when she

1623
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:55,052
heard her voice close to her ear.'You're thinking about something, my dear,

1624
01:51:55,052 --> 01:51:57,232
and that makes you forget to talk.

1625
01:51:57,232 --> 01:52:03,952
I can't tell you just now what the moral ofthat is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'

1626
01:52:03,952 --> 01:52:07,712
'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured toremark.

1627
01:52:07,712 --> 01:52:09,282
'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.

1628
01:52:09,282 --> 01:52:13,332
'Everything's got a moral, if only you canfind it.'

1629
01:52:13,332 --> 01:52:19,242
And she squeezed herself up closer toAlice's side as she spoke.

1630
01:52:19,242 --> 01:52:24,302
Alice did not much like keeping so close toher: first, because the Duchess was VERY

1631
01:52:24,302 --> 01:52:29,652
ugly; and secondly, because she was exactlythe right height to rest her chin upon

1632
01:52:29,652 --> 01:52:34,242
Alice's shoulder, and it was anuncomfortably sharp chin.

1633
01:52:34,242 --> 01:52:40,462
However, she did not like to be rude, soshe bore it as well as she could.

1634
01:52:40,462 --> 01:52:44,112
'The game's going on rather better now,'she said, by way of keeping up the

1635
01:52:44,112 --> 01:52:45,182
conversation a little.

1636
01:52:45,182 --> 01:52:51,811
''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moralof that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that

1637
01:52:51,811 --> 01:52:52,942
makes the world go round!"'

1638
01:52:52,942 --> 01:52:59,692
'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'thatit's done by everybody minding their own

1639
01:52:59,692 --> 01:53:02,222
business!''Ah, well!

1640
01:53:02,222 --> 01:53:06,712
It means much the same thing,' said theDuchess, digging her sharp little chin into

1641
01:53:06,712 --> 01:53:12,812
Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and themoral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense,

1642
01:53:12,812 --> 01:53:17,062
and the sounds will take care ofthemselves."'

1643
01:53:17,062 --> 01:53:20,352
'How fond she is of finding morals inthings!'

1644
01:53:20,352 --> 01:53:22,442
Alice thought to herself.

1645
01:53:22,442 --> 01:53:26,892
'I dare say you're wondering why I don'tput my arm round your waist,' the Duchess

1646
01:53:26,892 --> 01:53:31,642
said after a pause: 'the reason is, thatI'm doubtful about the temper of your

1647
01:53:31,642 --> 01:53:32,562
flamingo.

1648
01:53:32,562 --> 01:53:39,292
Shall I try the experiment?''HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied,

1649
01:53:39,292 --> 01:53:44,272
not feeling at all anxious to have theexperiment tried.

1650
01:53:44,272 --> 01:53:47,762
'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoesand mustard both bite.

1651
01:53:47,762 --> 01:53:54,282
And the moral of that is--"Birds of afeather flock together."'

1652
01:53:54,282 --> 01:53:58,112
'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Aliceremarked.

1653
01:53:58,112 --> 01:54:04,982
'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'whata clear way you have of putting things!'

1654
01:54:04,982 --> 01:54:07,442
'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.

1655
01:54:07,442 --> 01:54:12,512
'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, whoseemed ready to agree to everything that

1656
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:16,102
Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-minenear here.

1657
01:54:16,102 --> 01:54:21,952
And the moral of that is--"The more thereis of mine, the less there is of yours."'

1658
01:54:21,952 --> 01:54:27,712
'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had notattended to this last remark, 'it's a

1659
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,422
vegetable.

1660
01:54:28,422 --> 01:54:30,072
It doesn't look like one, but it is.'

1661
01:54:30,072 --> 01:54:37,642
'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess;'and the moral of that is--"Be what you

1662
01:54:37,642 --> 01:54:44,092
would seem to be"--or if you'd like it putmore simply--"Never imagine yourself not to

1663
01:54:44,092 --> 01:54:46,352
be otherwise than what it might appear to

1664
01:54:46,352 --> 01:54:51,791
others that what you were or might havebeen was not otherwise than what you had

1665
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:54,472
been would have appeared to them to beotherwise."'

1666
01:54:54,472 --> 01:55:01,911
'I think I should understand that better,'Alice said very politely, 'if I had it

1667
01:55:01,911 --> 01:55:06,952
written down: but I can't quite follow itas you say it.'

1668
01:55:06,952 --> 01:55:12,512
'That's nothing to what I could say if Ichose,' the Duchess replied, in a pleased

1669
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,942
tone.'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any

1670
01:55:14,942 --> 01:55:16,971
longer than that,' said Alice.

1671
01:55:16,971 --> 01:55:19,531
'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said theDuchess.

1672
01:55:19,531 --> 01:55:22,521
'I make you a present of everything I'vesaid as yet.'

1673
01:55:22,521 --> 01:55:26,192
'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.

1674
01:55:26,192 --> 01:55:29,632
'I'm glad they don't give birthday presentslike that!'

1675
01:55:29,632 --> 01:55:35,861
But she did not venture to say it out loud.'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with

1676
01:55:35,861 --> 01:55:40,051
another dig of her sharp little chin.

1677
01:55:40,051 --> 01:55:44,031
'I've a right to think,' said Alicesharply, for she was beginning to feel a

1678
01:55:44,031 --> 01:55:48,341
little worried.'Just about as much right,' said the

1679
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:53,111
Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and the m--'

1680
01:55:53,111 --> 01:55:57,971
But here, to Alice's great surprise, theDuchess's voice died away, even in the

1681
01:55:57,971 --> 01:56:03,421
middle of her favourite word 'moral,' andthe arm that was linked into hers began to

1682
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:04,762
tremble.

1683
01:56:04,762 --> 01:56:09,461
Alice looked up, and there stood the Queenin front of them, with her arms folded,

1684
01:56:09,461 --> 01:56:15,861
frowning like a thunderstorm.'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess

1685
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:19,051
began in a low, weak voice.

1686
01:56:19,051 --> 01:56:23,361
'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted theQueen, stamping on the ground as she spoke;

1687
01:56:23,361 --> 01:56:29,141
'either you or your head must be off, andthat in about half no time!

1688
01:56:29,141 --> 01:56:31,572
Take your choice!'

1689
01:56:31,572 --> 01:56:34,702
The Duchess took her choice, and was gonein a moment.

1690
01:56:34,702 --> 01:56:41,042
'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen saidto Alice; and Alice was too much frightened

1691
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:46,581
to say a word, but slowly followed her backto the croquet-ground.

1692
01:56:46,581 --> 01:56:50,671
The other guests had taken advantage of theQueen's absence, and were resting in the

1693
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:56,151
shade: however, the moment they saw her,they hurried back to the game, the Queen

1694
01:56:56,151 --> 01:57:02,051
merely remarking that a moment's delaywould cost them their lives.

1695
01:57:02,051 --> 01:57:05,162
All the time they were playing the Queennever left off quarrelling with the other

1696
01:57:05,162 --> 01:57:10,412
players, and shouting 'Off with his head!'or 'Off with her head!'

1697
01:57:10,412 --> 01:57:14,811
Those whom she sentenced were taken intocustody by the soldiers, who of course had

1698
01:57:14,811 --> 01:57:19,681
to leave off being arches to do this, sothat by the end of half an hour or so there

1699
01:57:19,681 --> 01:57:22,331
were no arches left, and all the players,

1700
01:57:22,331 --> 01:57:29,711
except the King, the Queen, and Alice, werein custody and under sentence of execution.

1701
01:57:29,711 --> 01:57:34,671
Then the Queen left off, quite out ofbreath, and said to Alice, 'Have you seen

1702
01:57:34,671 --> 01:57:37,141
the Mock Turtle yet?'

1703
01:57:37,141 --> 01:57:42,311
'No,' said Alice.'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'

1704
01:57:42,311 --> 01:57:46,602
'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is madefrom,' said the Queen.

1705
01:57:46,602 --> 01:57:50,042
'I never saw one, or heard of one,' saidAlice.

1706
01:57:50,042 --> 01:57:55,501
'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and heshall tell you his history,'

1707
01:57:55,501 --> 01:57:59,961
As they walked off together, Alice heardthe King say in a low voice, to the company

1708
01:57:59,961 --> 01:58:04,792
generally, 'You are all pardoned.'

1709
01:58:04,792 --> 01:58:09,391
'Come, THAT'S a good thing!' she said toherself, for she had felt quite unhappy at

1710
01:58:09,391 --> 01:58:14,061
the number of executions the Queen hadordered.

1711
01:58:14,061 --> 01:58:18,171
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lyingfast asleep in the sun.

1712
01:58:18,171 --> 01:58:22,401
(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, lookat the picture.)

1713
01:58:22,401 --> 01:58:26,991
'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and takethis young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and

1714
01:58:26,991 --> 01:58:28,141
to hear his history.

1715
01:58:28,141 --> 01:58:32,871
I must go back and see after someexecutions I have ordered'; and she walked

1716
01:58:32,871 --> 01:58:36,891
off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.

1717
01:58:36,891 --> 01:58:40,501
Alice did not quite like the look of thecreature, but on the whole she thought it

1718
01:58:40,501 --> 01:58:45,231
would be quite as safe to stay with it asto go after that savage Queen: so she

1719
01:58:45,231 --> 01:58:47,822
waited.

1720
01:58:47,822 --> 01:58:52,081
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:then it watched the Queen till she was out

1721
01:58:52,081 --> 01:58:56,412
of sight: then it chuckled.'What fun!' said the Gryphon, half to

1722
01:58:56,412 --> 01:58:59,451
itself, half to Alice.

1723
01:58:59,451 --> 01:59:03,471
'What IS the fun?' said Alice.'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.

1724
01:59:03,471 --> 01:59:07,501
'It's all her fancy, that: they neverexecutes nobody, you know.

1725
01:59:07,501 --> 01:59:07,852
Come on!'

1726
01:59:07,852 --> 01:59:14,592
'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thoughtAlice, as she went slowly after it: 'I

1727
01:59:14,592 --> 01:59:20,291
never was so ordered about in all my life,never!'

1728
01:59:20,291 --> 01:59:25,041
They had not gone far before they saw theMock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad

1729
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:30,101
and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,as they came nearer, Alice could hear him

1730
01:59:30,101 --> 01:59:33,312
sighing as if his heart would break.

1731
01:59:33,312 --> 01:59:36,432
She pitied him deeply.

1732
01:59:36,432 --> 01:59:40,572
'What is his sorrow?' she asked theGryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very

1733
01:59:40,572 --> 01:59:46,052
nearly in the same words as before, 'It'sall his fancy, that: he hasn't got no

1734
01:59:46,052 --> 01:59:47,182
sorrow, you know.

1735
01:59:47,182 --> 01:59:51,822
Come on!'So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who

1736
01:59:51,822 --> 01:59:55,781
looked at them with large eyes full oftears, but said nothing.

1737
01:59:55,781 --> 02:00:01,212
'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon,'she wants for to know your history, she

1738
02:00:01,212 --> 02:00:03,101
do.'

1739
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:08,462
'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle ina deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of

1740
02:00:08,462 --> 02:00:12,361
you, and don't speak a word till I'vefinished.'

1741
02:00:12,361 --> 02:00:16,202
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for someminutes.

1742
02:00:16,202 --> 02:00:22,702
Alice thought to herself, 'I don't see howhe can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.'

1743
02:00:22,702 --> 02:00:26,171
But she waited patiently.

1744
02:00:26,171 --> 02:00:34,382
'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, witha deep sigh, 'I was a real Turtle.'

1745
02:00:34,382 --> 02:00:38,952
These words were followed by a very longsilence, broken only by an occasional

1746
02:00:38,952 --> 02:00:45,111
exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon,and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock

1747
02:00:45,111 --> 02:00:46,392
Turtle.

1748
02:00:46,392 --> 02:00:50,291
Alice was very nearly getting up andsaying, 'Thank you, sir, for your

1749
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:55,522
interesting story,' but she could not helpthinking there MUST be more to come, so she

1750
02:00:55,522 --> 02:00:59,522
sat still and said nothing.

1751
02:00:59,522 --> 02:01:04,272
'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle wenton at last, more calmly, though still

1752
02:01:04,272 --> 02:01:09,122
sobbing a little now and then, 'we went toschool in the sea.

1753
02:01:09,122 --> 02:01:12,392
The master was an old Turtle--we used tocall him Tortoise--'

1754
02:01:12,392 --> 02:01:16,041
'Why did you call him Tortoise, if hewasn't one?'

1755
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:16,961
Alice asked.

1756
02:01:16,961 --> 02:01:22,262
'We called him Tortoise because he taughtus,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really

1757
02:01:22,262 --> 02:01:25,252
you are very dull!'

1758
02:01:25,252 --> 02:01:29,572
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself forasking such a simple question,' added the

1759
02:01:29,572 --> 02:01:34,731
Gryphon; and then they both sat silent andlooked at poor Alice, who felt ready to

1760
02:01:34,731 --> 02:01:37,062
sink into the earth.

1761
02:01:37,062 --> 02:01:41,062
At last the Gryphon said to the MockTurtle, 'Drive on, old fellow!

1762
02:01:41,062 --> 02:01:47,192
Don't be all day about it!' and he went onin these words:

1763
02:01:47,192 --> 02:01:50,492
'Yes, we went to school in the sea, thoughyou mayn't believe it--'

1764
02:01:50,492 --> 02:01:57,492
'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.

1765
02:01:57,492 --> 02:02:01,711
'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon,before Alice could speak again.

1766
02:02:01,711 --> 02:02:07,522
The Mock Turtle went on.'We had the best of educations--in fact, we

1767
02:02:07,522 --> 02:02:08,541
went to school every day--'

1768
02:02:08,541 --> 02:02:14,721
'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' saidAlice; 'you needn't be so proud as all

1769
02:02:14,721 --> 02:02:19,252
that.''With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a

1770
02:02:19,252 --> 02:02:20,591
little anxiously.

1771
02:02:20,591 --> 02:02:24,211
'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French andmusic.'

1772
02:02:24,211 --> 02:02:30,052
'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.

1773
02:02:30,052 --> 02:02:34,452
'Ah! then yours wasn't a really goodschool,' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of

1774
02:02:34,452 --> 02:02:38,302
great relief.'Now at OURS they had at the end of the

1775
02:02:38,302 --> 02:02:43,171
bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'

1776
02:02:43,171 --> 02:02:46,711
'You couldn't have wanted it much,' saidAlice; 'living at the bottom of the sea.'

1777
02:02:46,711 --> 02:02:52,142
'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said theMock Turtle with a sigh.

1778
02:02:52,142 --> 02:02:53,901
'I only took the regular course.'

1779
02:02:53,901 --> 02:02:58,721
'What was that?' inquired Alice.

1780
02:02:58,721 --> 02:03:03,271
'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to beginwith,' the Mock Turtle replied; 'and then

1781
02:03:03,271 --> 02:03:08,742
the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and

1782
02:03:08,742 --> 02:03:10,671
Derision.'

1783
02:03:10,671 --> 02:03:13,971
'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Aliceventured to say.

1784
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:17,882
'What is it?'The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in

1785
02:03:17,882 --> 02:03:19,271
surprise.

1786
02:03:19,271 --> 02:03:22,361
'What!Never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.

1787
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:28,661
'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?''Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--

1788
02:03:28,661 --> 02:03:31,642
to--make--anything--prettier.'

1789
02:03:31,642 --> 02:03:36,611
'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if youdon't know what to uglify is, you ARE a

1790
02:03:36,611 --> 02:03:39,582
simpleton.'

1791
02:03:39,582 --> 02:03:44,082
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask anymore questions about it, so she turned to

1792
02:03:44,082 --> 02:03:49,341
the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else hadyou to learn?'

1793
02:03:49,341 --> 02:03:53,812
'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtlereplied, counting off the subjects on his

1794
02:03:53,812 --> 02:03:59,961
flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern,with Seaography: then Drawling--the

1795
02:03:59,961 --> 02:04:02,562
Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that

1796
02:04:02,562 --> 02:04:07,052
used to come once a week: HE taught usDrawling, Stretching, and Fainting in

1797
02:04:07,052 --> 02:04:12,041
Coils.''What was THAT like?' said Alice.

1798
02:04:12,041 --> 02:04:15,692
'Well, I can't show it you myself,' theMock Turtle said: 'I'm too stiff.

1799
02:04:15,692 --> 02:04:21,091
And the Gryphon never learnt it.''Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to

1800
02:04:21,091 --> 02:04:22,271
the Classics master, though.

1801
02:04:22,271 --> 02:04:27,622
He was an old crab, HE was.''I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said

1802
02:04:27,622 --> 02:04:32,541
with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief,they used to say.'

1803
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:37,671
'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon,sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid

1804
02:04:37,671 --> 02:04:41,692
their faces in their paws.

1805
02:04:41,692 --> 02:04:46,562
'And how many hours a day did you dolessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change

1806
02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:51,081
the subject.'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock

1807
02:04:51,081 --> 02:04:52,992
Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.'

1808
02:04:52,992 --> 02:05:00,271
'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.'That's the reason they're called lessons,'

1809
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:03,481
the Gryphon remarked: 'because they lessenfrom day to day.'

1810
02:05:03,481 --> 02:05:09,981
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and shethought it over a little before she made

1811
02:05:09,981 --> 02:05:14,661
her next remark.'Then the eleventh day must have been a

1812
02:05:14,661 --> 02:05:16,452
holiday?'

1813
02:05:16,452 --> 02:05:21,802
'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.'And how did you manage on the twelfth?'

1814
02:05:21,802 --> 02:05:23,122
Alice went on eagerly.

1815
02:05:23,122 --> 02:05:29,471
'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphoninterrupted in a very decided tone: 'tell

1816
02:05:29,471 --> 02:05:36,832
her something about the games now.'

1817
02:05:36,832 --> 02:05:37,832
>

1818
02:05:37,832 --> 02:05:47,761
Chapter X. The Lobster QuadrilleThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the

1819
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:53,141
back of one flapper across his eyes.He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but

1820
02:05:53,141 --> 02:05:56,002
for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.

1821
02:05:56,002 --> 02:06:00,882
'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'said the Gryphon: and it set to work

1822
02:06:00,882 --> 02:06:03,402
shaking him and punching him in the back.

1823
02:06:03,402 --> 02:06:08,192
At last the Mock Turtle recovered hisvoice, and, with tears running down his

1824
02:06:08,192 --> 02:06:11,792
cheeks, he went on again:--

1825
02:06:11,792 --> 02:06:18,661
'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said Alice)--'and perhaps

1826
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:25,421
you were never even introduced to alobster--' (Alice began to say 'I once

1827
02:06:25,421 --> 02:06:28,411
tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and

1828
02:06:28,411 --> 02:06:35,342
said 'No, never') '--so you can have noidea what a delightful thing a Lobster

1829
02:06:35,342 --> 02:06:38,151
Quadrille is!''No, indeed,' said Alice.

1830
02:06:38,151 --> 02:06:40,061
'What sort of a dance is it?'

1831
02:06:40,061 --> 02:06:46,082
'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first forminto a line along the sea-shore--'

1832
02:06:46,082 --> 02:06:47,942
'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.

1833
02:06:47,942 --> 02:06:53,112
'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then,when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out

1834
02:06:53,112 --> 02:06:57,072
of the way--''THAT generally takes some time,'

1835
02:06:57,072 --> 02:06:59,582
interrupted the Gryphon.

1836
02:06:59,582 --> 02:07:03,771
'--you advance twice--''Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried

1837
02:07:03,771 --> 02:07:07,451
the Gryphon.'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance

1838
02:07:07,451 --> 02:07:11,262
twice, set to partners--'

1839
02:07:11,262 --> 02:07:15,962
'--change lobsters, and retire in sameorder,' continued the Gryphon.

1840
02:07:15,962 --> 02:07:19,402
'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on,'you throw the--'

1841
02:07:19,402 --> 02:07:24,252
'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with abound into the air.

1842
02:07:24,252 --> 02:07:30,591
'--as far out to sea as you can--''Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.

1843
02:07:30,591 --> 02:07:36,581
'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried theMock Turtle, capering wildly about.

1844
02:07:36,581 --> 02:07:41,011
'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphonat the top of its voice.

1845
02:07:41,011 --> 02:07:45,292
'Back to land again, and that's all thefirst figure,' said the Mock Turtle,

1846
02:07:45,292 --> 02:07:50,151
suddenly dropping his voice; and the twocreatures, who had been jumping about like

1847
02:07:50,151 --> 02:07:53,282
mad things all this time, sat down again

1848
02:07:53,282 --> 02:07:57,892
very sadly and quietly, and looked atAlice.

1849
02:07:57,892 --> 02:08:02,332
'It must be a very pretty dance,' saidAlice timidly.

1850
02:08:02,332 --> 02:08:06,502
'Would you like to see a little of it?'said the Mock Turtle.

1851
02:08:06,502 --> 02:08:11,512
'Very much indeed,' said Alice.'Come, let's try the first figure!' said

1852
02:08:11,512 --> 02:08:12,732
the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.

1853
02:08:12,732 --> 02:08:16,202
'We can do without lobsters, you know.Which shall sing?'

1854
02:08:16,202 --> 02:08:22,541
'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.'I've forgotten the words.'

1855
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:27,892
So they began solemnly dancing round andround Alice, every now and then treading on

1856
02:08:27,892 --> 02:08:32,762
her toes when they passed too close, andwaving their forepaws to mark the time,

1857
02:08:32,762 --> 02:08:38,812
while the Mock Turtle sang this, veryslowly and sadly:--

1858
02:08:38,812 --> 02:08:42,512
'"Will you walk a little faster?" said awhiting to a snail.

1859
02:08:42,512 --> 02:08:46,851
"There's a porpoise close behind us, andhe's treading on my tail.

1860
02:08:46,851 --> 02:08:50,532
See how eagerly the lobsters and theturtles all advance!

1861
02:08:50,532 --> 02:08:55,211
They are waiting on the shingle--will youcome and join the dance?

1862
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:59,491
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,will you join the dance?

1863
02:08:59,491 --> 02:09:04,622
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,won't you join the dance?

1864
02:09:04,622 --> 02:09:09,041
"You can really have no notion howdelightful it will be When they take us up

1865
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:12,151
and throw us, with the lobsters, out tosea!"

1866
02:09:12,151 --> 02:09:18,442
But the snail replied "Too far, too far!"and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked

1867
02:09:18,442 --> 02:09:22,041
the whiting kindly, but he would not jointhe dance.

1868
02:09:22,041 --> 02:09:26,661
Would not, could not, would not, couldnot, would not join the dance.

1869
02:09:26,661 --> 02:09:31,961
Would not, could not, would not, could not,could not join the dance.

1870
02:09:31,961 --> 02:09:35,291
'"What matters it how far we go?" hisscaly friend replied.

1871
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:38,332
"There is another shore, you know, upon theother side.

1872
02:09:38,332 --> 02:09:43,422
The further off from England the nearer isto France-- Then turn not pale, beloved

1873
02:09:43,422 --> 02:09:46,332
snail, but come and join the dance.

1874
02:09:46,332 --> 02:09:50,491
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,will you join the dance?

1875
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:54,122
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,won't you join the dance?"'

1876
02:09:54,122 --> 02:10:01,591
'Thank you, it's a very interesting danceto watch,' said Alice, feeling very glad

1877
02:10:01,591 --> 02:10:06,852
that it was over at last: 'and I do so likethat curious song about the whiting!'

1878
02:10:06,852 --> 02:10:12,172
'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the MockTurtle, 'they--you've seen them, of

1879
02:10:12,172 --> 02:10:17,031
course?''Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at

1880
02:10:17,031 --> 02:10:19,632
dinn--' she checked herself hastily.

1881
02:10:19,632 --> 02:10:25,232
'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said theMock Turtle, 'but if you've seen them so

1882
02:10:25,232 --> 02:10:28,462
often, of course you know what they'relike.'

1883
02:10:28,462 --> 02:10:32,132
'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.

1884
02:10:32,132 --> 02:10:37,702
'They have their tails in their mouths--andthey're all over crumbs.'

1885
02:10:37,702 --> 02:10:41,582
'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said theMock Turtle: 'crumbs would all wash off in

1886
02:10:41,582 --> 02:10:42,332
the sea.

1887
02:10:42,332 --> 02:10:48,151
But they HAVE their tails in their mouths;and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle

1888
02:10:48,151 --> 02:10:53,322
yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her about the reason and all that,'

1889
02:10:53,322 --> 02:10:55,882
he said to the Gryphon.

1890
02:10:55,882 --> 02:11:00,162
'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'thatthey WOULD go with the lobsters to the

1891
02:11:00,162 --> 02:11:02,662
dance.So they got thrown out to sea.

1892
02:11:02,662 --> 02:11:04,392
So they had to fall a long way.

1893
02:11:04,392 --> 02:11:07,082
So they got their tails fast in theirmouths.

1894
02:11:07,082 --> 02:11:09,221
So they couldn't get them out again.That's all.'

1895
02:11:09,221 --> 02:11:13,621
'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's veryinteresting.

1896
02:11:13,621 --> 02:11:17,871
I never knew so much about a whitingbefore.'

1897
02:11:17,871 --> 02:11:20,382
'I can tell you more than that, if youlike,' said the Gryphon.

1898
02:11:20,382 --> 02:11:25,642
'Do you know why it's called a whiting?''I never thought about it,' said Alice.

1899
02:11:25,642 --> 02:11:26,022
'Why?'

1900
02:11:26,022 --> 02:11:34,501
'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphonreplied very solemnly.

1901
02:11:34,501 --> 02:11:39,651
Alice was thoroughly puzzled.'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in

1902
02:11:39,651 --> 02:11:40,492
a wondering tone.

1903
02:11:40,492 --> 02:11:44,692
'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' saidthe Gryphon.

1904
02:11:44,692 --> 02:11:50,922
'I mean, what makes them so shiny?'Alice looked down at them, and considered a

1905
02:11:50,922 --> 02:11:52,311
little before she gave her answer.

1906
02:11:52,311 --> 02:11:59,382
'They're done with blacking, I believe.''Boots and shoes under the sea,' the

1907
02:11:59,382 --> 02:12:03,332
Gryphon went on in a deep voice, 'are donewith a whiting.

1908
02:12:03,332 --> 02:12:06,212
Now you know.'

1909
02:12:06,212 --> 02:12:10,142
'And what are they made of?'Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

1910
02:12:10,142 --> 02:12:16,912
'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphonreplied rather impatiently: 'any shrimp

1911
02:12:16,912 --> 02:12:19,662
could have told you that.'

1912
02:12:19,662 --> 02:12:23,522
'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice,whose thoughts were still running on the

1913
02:12:23,522 --> 02:12:31,192
song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keepback, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'

1914
02:12:31,192 --> 02:12:35,242
'They were obliged to have him with them,'the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fish would

1915
02:12:35,242 --> 02:12:40,251
go anywhere without a porpoise.''Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone

1916
02:12:40,251 --> 02:12:41,052
of great surprise.

1917
02:12:41,052 --> 02:12:46,442
'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:'why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he

1918
02:12:46,442 --> 02:12:51,501
was going a journey, I should say "Withwhat porpoise?"'

1919
02:12:51,501 --> 02:12:53,672
'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.

1920
02:12:53,672 --> 02:12:59,742
'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtlereplied in an offended tone.

1921
02:12:59,742 --> 02:13:04,192
And the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hearsome of YOUR adventures.'

1922
02:13:04,192 --> 02:13:10,181
'I could tell you my adventures--beginningfrom this morning,' said Alice a little

1923
02:13:10,181 --> 02:13:14,811
timidly: 'but it's no use going back toyesterday, because I was a different person

1924
02:13:14,811 --> 02:13:17,211
then.'

1925
02:13:17,211 --> 02:13:20,371
'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.'No, no!

1926
02:13:20,371 --> 02:13:25,681
The adventures first,' said the Gryphon inan impatient tone: 'explanations take such

1927
02:13:25,681 --> 02:13:28,522
a dreadful time.'

1928
02:13:28,522 --> 02:13:32,632
So Alice began telling them her adventuresfrom the time when she first saw the White

1929
02:13:32,632 --> 02:13:33,602
Rabbit.

1930
02:13:33,602 --> 02:13:37,871
She was a little nervous about it just atfirst, the two creatures got so close to

1931
02:13:37,871 --> 02:13:44,082
her, one on each side, and opened theireyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she

1932
02:13:44,082 --> 02:13:46,431
gained courage as she went on.

1933
02:13:46,431 --> 02:13:50,651
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till shegot to the part about her repeating 'YOU

1934
02:13:50,651 --> 02:13:54,642
ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to theCaterpillar, and the words all coming

1935
02:13:54,642 --> 02:13:56,971
different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a

1936
02:13:56,971 --> 02:14:00,711
long breath, and said 'That's verycurious.'

1937
02:14:00,711 --> 02:14:07,452
'It's all about as curious as it can be,'said the Gryphon.

1938
02:14:07,452 --> 02:14:10,782
'It all came different!' the Mock Turtlerepeated thoughtfully.

1939
02:14:10,782 --> 02:14:14,282
'I should like to hear her try and repeatsomething now.

1940
02:14:14,282 --> 02:14:16,692
Tell her to begin.'

1941
02:14:16,692 --> 02:14:22,722
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thoughtit had some kind of authority over Alice.

1942
02:14:22,722 --> 02:14:29,252
'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THESLUGGARD,"' said the Gryphon.

1943
02:14:29,252 --> 02:14:34,402
'How the creatures order one about, andmake one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'I

1944
02:14:34,402 --> 02:14:37,372
might as well be at school at once.'

1945
02:14:37,372 --> 02:14:42,242
However, she got up, and began to repeatit, but her head was so full of the Lobster

1946
02:14:42,242 --> 02:14:46,522
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what shewas saying, and the words came very queer

1947
02:14:46,522 --> 02:14:47,122
indeed:--

1948
02:14:47,122 --> 02:14:51,882
''Tis the voice of the Lobster;I heard him declare,

1949
02:14:51,882 --> 02:14:54,582
"You have baked me too brown,I must sugar my hair."

1950
02:14:54,582 --> 02:14:58,732
As a duck with its eyelids,so he with his nose

1951
02:14:58,732 --> 02:15:02,682
Trims his belt and his buttons,and turns out his toes.'

1952
02:15:02,682 --> 02:15:05,462
[later editions continued as followsWhen the sands are all dry,

1953
02:15:05,462 --> 02:15:08,752
he is gay as a lark,And will talk in contemptuous

1954
02:15:08,752 --> 02:15:09,862
tones of the Shark,

1955
02:15:09,862 --> 02:15:13,172
But, when the tide risesand sharks are around,

1956
02:15:13,172 --> 02:15:17,042
His voice has a timidand tremulous sound.]

1957
02:15:17,042 --> 02:15:23,242
'That's different from what I used to saywhen I was a child,' said the Gryphon.

1958
02:15:23,242 --> 02:15:27,082
'Well, I never heard it before,' said theMock Turtle; 'but it sounds uncommon

1959
02:15:27,082 --> 02:15:29,642
nonsense.'

1960
02:15:29,642 --> 02:15:33,642
Alice said nothing; she had sat down withher face in her hands, wondering if

1961
02:15:33,642 --> 02:15:38,612
anything would EVER happen in a natural wayagain.

1962
02:15:38,612 --> 02:15:42,302
'I should like to have it explained,' saidthe Mock Turtle.

1963
02:15:42,302 --> 02:15:44,312
'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphonhastily.

1964
02:15:44,312 --> 02:15:47,182
'Go on with the next verse.'

1965
02:15:47,182 --> 02:15:50,052
'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtlepersisted.

1966
02:15:50,052 --> 02:15:54,752
'How COULD he turn them out with his nose,you know?'

1967
02:15:54,752 --> 02:15:56,792
'It's the first position in dancing.'

1968
02:15:56,792 --> 02:16:02,192
Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled bythe whole thing, and longed to change the

1969
02:16:02,192 --> 02:16:04,722
subject.

1970
02:16:04,722 --> 02:16:09,712
'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphonrepeated impatiently: 'it begins "I passed

1971
02:16:09,712 --> 02:16:12,692
by his garden."'

1972
02:16:12,692 --> 02:16:17,922
Alice did not dare to disobey, though shefelt sure it would all come wrong, and she

1973
02:16:17,922 --> 02:16:19,612
went on in a trembling voice:--

1974
02:16:19,612 --> 02:16:24,482
'I passed by his garden,and marked, with one eye,

1975
02:16:24,482 --> 02:16:27,642
How the Owl and the Pantherwere sharing a pie--'

1976
02:16:27,642 --> 02:16:30,332
[later editions continued as followsThe Panther took pie-crust,

1977
02:16:30,332 --> 02:16:33,222
and gravy, and meat,While the Owl had the dish

1978
02:16:33,222 --> 02:16:34,662
as its share of the treat.

1979
02:16:34,662 --> 02:16:38,042
When the pie was all finished,the Owl, as a boon,

1980
02:16:38,042 --> 02:16:40,532
Was kindly permittedto pocket the spoon:

1981
02:16:40,532 --> 02:16:43,872
While the Panther received knifeand fork with a growl,

1982
02:16:43,872 --> 02:16:47,792
And concluded the banquet--]

1983
02:16:47,792 --> 02:16:52,192
'What IS the use of repeating all thatstuff,' the Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if

1984
02:16:52,192 --> 02:16:56,352
you don't explain it as you go on?It's by far the most confusing thing I ever

1985
02:16:56,352 --> 02:16:58,672
heard!'

1986
02:16:58,672 --> 02:17:03,022
'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' saidthe Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to

1987
02:17:03,022 --> 02:17:07,892
do so.'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster

1988
02:17:07,892 --> 02:17:09,722
Quadrille?' the Gryphon went on.

1989
02:17:09,722 --> 02:17:13,332
'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to singyou a song?'

1990
02:17:13,332 --> 02:17:18,962
'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtlewould be so kind,' Alice replied, so

1991
02:17:18,962 --> 02:17:23,712
eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a ratheroffended tone, 'Hm!

1992
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:25,522
No accounting for tastes!

1993
02:17:25,522 --> 02:17:29,542
Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, oldfellow?'

1994
02:17:29,542 --> 02:17:35,582
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began,in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to

1995
02:17:35,582 --> 02:17:38,602
sing this:--

1996
02:17:38,602 --> 02:17:42,602
'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,Waiting in a hot tureen!

1997
02:17:42,602 --> 02:17:49,292
Who for such dainties would not stoop?Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!

1998
02:17:49,292 --> 02:17:53,072
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!

1999
02:17:53,072 --> 02:17:56,162
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!

2000
02:17:56,162 --> 02:18:01,252
Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

2001
02:18:01,252 --> 02:18:05,932
'Beautiful Soup!Who cares for fish,

2002
02:18:05,932 --> 02:18:10,622
Game, or any other dish?Who would not give all else for two

2003
02:18:10,622 --> 02:18:13,172
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?

2004
02:18:13,172 --> 02:18:16,232
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?

2005
02:18:16,232 --> 02:18:19,842
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!

2006
02:18:19,842 --> 02:18:25,292
Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'

2007
02:18:25,292 --> 02:18:32,212
'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and theMock Turtle had just begun to repeat it,

2008
02:18:32,212 --> 02:18:37,212
when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' washeard in the distance.

2009
02:18:37,212 --> 02:18:43,142
'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, takingAlice by the hand, it hurried off, without

2010
02:18:43,142 --> 02:18:47,722
waiting for the end of the song.'What trial is it?'

2011
02:18:47,722 --> 02:18:53,152
Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphononly answered 'Come on!' and ran the

2012
02:18:53,152 --> 02:18:58,762
faster, while more and more faintly came,carried on the breeze that followed them,

2013
02:18:58,762 --> 02:19:00,182
the melancholy words:--

Chapter XI. Who Stole the Tarts?

2017
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:26,652
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated ontheir throne when they arrived, with a

2018
02:19:26,652 --> 02:19:31,601
great crowd assembled about them--all sortsof little birds and beasts, as well as the

2019
02:19:31,601 --> 02:19:34,632
whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing

2020
02:19:34,632 --> 02:19:39,512
before them, in chains, with a soldier oneach side to guard him; and near the King

2021
02:19:39,512 --> 02:19:43,281
was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in onehand, and a scroll of parchment in the

2022
02:19:43,281 --> 02:19:44,312
other.

2023
02:19:44,312 --> 02:19:49,082
In the very middle of the court was atable, with a large dish of tarts upon it:

2024
02:19:49,082 --> 02:19:53,772
they looked so good, that it made Alicequite hungry to look at them--'I wish

2025
02:19:53,772 --> 02:19:58,342
they'd get the trial done,' she thought,'and hand round the refreshments!'

2026
02:19:58,342 --> 02:20:02,411
But there seemed to be no chance of this,so she began looking at everything about

2027
02:20:02,411 --> 02:20:05,862
her, to pass away the time.

2028
02:20:05,862 --> 02:20:09,371
Alice had never been in a court of justicebefore, but she had read about them in

2029
02:20:09,371 --> 02:20:13,481
books, and she was quite pleased to findthat she knew the name of nearly everything

2030
02:20:13,481 --> 02:20:13,832
there.

2031
02:20:13,832 --> 02:20:18,972
'That's the judge,' she said to herself,'because of his great wig.'

2032
02:20:18,972 --> 02:20:26,021
The judge, by the way, was the King; and ashe wore his crown over the wig, (look at

2033
02:20:26,021 --> 02:20:29,831
the frontispiece if you want to see how hedid it,) he did not look at all

2034
02:20:29,831 --> 02:20:34,102
comfortable, and it was certainly notbecoming.

2035
02:20:34,102 --> 02:20:39,081
'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice,'and those twelve creatures,' (she was

2036
02:20:39,081 --> 02:20:43,221
obliged to say 'creatures,' you see,because some of them were animals, and some

2037
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:48,401
were birds,) 'I suppose they are thejurors.'

2038
02:20:48,401 --> 02:20:52,451
She said this last word two or three timesover to herself, being rather proud of it:

2039
02:20:52,451 --> 02:20:57,441
for she thought, and rightly too, that veryfew little girls of her age knew the

2040
02:20:57,441 --> 02:20:59,381
meaning of it at all.

2041
02:20:59,381 --> 02:21:03,881
However, 'jury-men' would have done just aswell.

2042
02:21:03,881 --> 02:21:07,161
The twelve jurors were all writing verybusily on slates.

2043
02:21:07,161 --> 02:21:09,321
'What are they doing?'

2044
02:21:09,321 --> 02:21:12,991
Alice whispered to the Gryphon.'They can't have anything to put down yet,

2045
02:21:12,991 --> 02:21:15,271
before the trial's begun.'

2046
02:21:15,271 --> 02:21:19,901
'They're putting down their names,' theGryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they

2047
02:21:19,901 --> 02:21:23,532
should forget them before the end of thetrial.'

2048
02:21:23,532 --> 02:21:24,291
'Stupid things!'

2049
02:21:24,291 --> 02:21:29,172
Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, butshe stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit

2050
02:21:29,172 --> 02:21:34,931
cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and theKing put on his spectacles and looked

2051
02:21:34,931 --> 02:21:39,711
anxiously round, to make out who wastalking.

2052
02:21:39,711 --> 02:21:43,672
Alice could see, as well as if she werelooking over their shoulders, that all the

2053
02:21:43,672 --> 02:21:48,851
jurors were writing down 'stupid things!'on their slates, and she could even make

2054
02:21:48,851 --> 02:21:50,541
out that one of them didn't know how to

2055
02:21:50,541 --> 02:21:54,541
spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask hisneighbour to tell him.

2056
02:21:54,541 --> 02:22:01,342
'A nice muddle their slates'll be in beforethe trial's over!' thought Alice.

2057
02:22:01,342 --> 02:22:04,092
One of the jurors had a pencil thatsqueaked.

2058
02:22:04,092 --> 02:22:08,332
This of course, Alice could not stand, andshe went round the court and got behind

2059
02:22:08,332 --> 02:22:11,862
him, and very soon found an opportunity oftaking it away.

2060
02:22:11,862 --> 02:22:17,601
She did it so quickly that the poor littlejuror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not

2061
02:22:17,601 --> 02:22:22,012
make out at all what had become of it; so,after hunting all about for it, he was

2062
02:22:22,012 --> 02:22:24,262
obliged to write with one finger for the

2063
02:22:24,262 --> 02:22:29,232
rest of the day; and this was of verylittle use, as it left no mark on the

2064
02:22:29,232 --> 02:22:33,301
slate.'Herald, read the accusation!' said the

2065
02:22:33,301 --> 02:22:33,301
King.

2066
02:22:33,301 --> 02:22:40,512
On this the White Rabbit blew three blastson the trumpet, and then unrolled the

2067
02:22:40,512 --> 02:22:44,622
parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

2068
02:22:44,622 --> 02:22:48,061
'The Queen of Hearts,she madesome tarts,All on a summer day:

2069
02:22:48,061 --> 02:22:55,012
The Knave of Hearts,he stolethose tarts,And took them quite away!'

2070
02:22:55,012 --> 02:22:59,071
'Consider your verdict,' the King said tothe jury.

2071
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,642
'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastilyinterrupted.

2072
02:23:01,642 --> 02:23:05,512
'There's a great deal to come before that!'

2073
02:23:05,512 --> 02:23:09,681
'Call the first witness,' said the King;and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on

2074
02:23:09,681 --> 02:23:13,861
the trumpet, and called out, 'Firstwitness!'

2075
02:23:13,861 --> 02:23:15,801
The first witness was the Hatter.

2076
02:23:15,801 --> 02:23:20,661
He came in with a teacup in one hand and apiece of bread-and-butter in the other.

2077
02:23:20,661 --> 02:23:25,502
'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he began,'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite

2078
02:23:25,502 --> 02:23:29,202
finished my tea when I was sent for.'

2079
02:23:29,202 --> 02:23:30,691
'You ought to have finished,' said theKing.

2080
02:23:30,691 --> 02:23:33,802
'When did you begin?'

2081
02:23:33,802 --> 02:23:37,852
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, whohad followed him into the court, arm-in-arm

2082
02:23:37,852 --> 02:23:42,072
with the Dormouse.'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he

2083
02:23:42,072 --> 02:23:43,692
said.

2084
02:23:43,692 --> 02:23:47,602
'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.

2085
02:23:47,602 --> 02:23:53,582
'Write that down,' the King said to thejury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all

2086
02:23:53,582 --> 02:23:58,492
three dates on their slates, and then addedthem up, and reduced the answer to

2087
02:23:58,492 --> 02:24:01,561
shillings and pence.

2088
02:24:01,561 --> 02:24:03,612
'Take off your hat,' the King said to theHatter.

2089
02:24:03,612 --> 02:24:07,642
'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.

2090
02:24:07,642 --> 02:24:11,962
'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning tothe jury, who instantly made a memorandum

2091
02:24:11,962 --> 02:24:16,531
of the fact.'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as

2092
02:24:16,531 --> 02:24:19,112
an explanation; 'I've none of my own.

2093
02:24:19,112 --> 02:24:23,692
I'm a hatter.'Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and

2094
02:24:23,692 --> 02:24:29,162
began staring at the Hatter, who turnedpale and fidgeted.

2095
02:24:29,162 --> 02:24:32,982
'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'anddon't be nervous, or I'll have you executed

2096
02:24:32,982 --> 02:24:35,322
on the spot.'

2097
02:24:35,322 --> 02:24:40,262
This did not seem to encourage the witnessat all: he kept shifting from one foot to

2098
02:24:40,262 --> 02:24:45,711
the other, looking uneasily at the Queen,and in his confusion he bit a large piece

2099
02:24:45,711 --> 02:24:50,542
out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

2100
02:24:50,542 --> 02:24:55,172
Just at this moment Alice felt a verycurious sensation, which puzzled her a good

2101
02:24:55,172 --> 02:25:00,522
deal until she made out what it was: shewas beginning to grow larger again, and she

2102
02:25:00,522 --> 02:25:02,702
thought at first she would get up and leave

2103
02:25:02,702 --> 02:25:07,242
the court; but on second thoughts shedecided to remain where she was as long as

2104
02:25:07,242 --> 02:25:12,371
there was room for her.'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the

2105
02:25:12,371 --> 02:25:14,241
Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.

2106
02:25:14,241 --> 02:25:19,491
'I can hardly breathe.''I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:

2107
02:25:19,491 --> 02:25:23,901
'I'm growing.''You've no right to grow here,' said the

2108
02:25:23,901 --> 02:25:24,971
Dormouse.

2109
02:25:24,971 --> 02:25:31,651
'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice moreboldly: 'you know you're growing too.'

2110
02:25:31,651 --> 02:25:36,942
'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,'said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous

2111
02:25:36,942 --> 02:25:38,241
fashion.'

2112
02:25:38,241 --> 02:25:43,971
And he got up very sulkily and crossed overto the other side of the court.

2113
02:25:43,971 --> 02:25:48,832
All this time the Queen had never left offstaring at the Hatter, and, just as the

2114
02:25:48,832 --> 02:25:53,721
Dormouse crossed the court, she said to oneof the officers of the court, 'Bring me the

2115
02:25:53,721 --> 02:25:56,982
list of the singers in the last concert!'

2116
02:25:56,982 --> 02:26:03,382
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so,that he shook both his shoes off.

2117
02:26:03,382 --> 02:26:07,952
'Give your evidence,' the King repeatedangrily, 'or I'll have you executed,

2118
02:26:07,952 --> 02:26:11,531
whether you're nervous or not.'

2119
02:26:11,531 --> 02:26:17,072
'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatterbegan, in a trembling voice, '--and I

2120
02:26:17,072 --> 02:26:22,251
hadn't begun my tea--not above a week orso--and what with the bread-and-butter

2121
02:26:22,251 --> 02:26:26,762
getting so thin--and the twinkling of thetea--'

2122
02:26:26,762 --> 02:26:32,702
'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.'It began with the tea,' the Hatter

2123
02:26:32,702 --> 02:26:34,491
replied.

2124
02:26:34,491 --> 02:26:37,991
'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' saidthe King sharply.

2125
02:26:37,991 --> 02:26:42,392
'Do you take me for a dunce?Go on!'

2126
02:26:42,392 --> 02:26:47,922
'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'andmost things twinkled after that--only the

2127
02:26:47,922 --> 02:26:52,162
March Hare said--''I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a

2128
02:26:52,162 --> 02:26:53,442
great hurry.

2129
02:26:53,442 --> 02:26:58,151
'You did!' said the Hatter.'I deny it!' said the March Hare.

2130
02:26:58,151 --> 02:27:02,271
'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave outthat part.'

2131
02:27:02,271 --> 02:27:07,512
'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--'the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round

2132
02:27:07,512 --> 02:27:12,401
to see if he would deny it too: but theDormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

2133
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:17,912
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cutsome more bread-and-butter--'

2134
02:27:17,912 --> 02:27:22,912
'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of thejury asked.

2135
02:27:22,912 --> 02:27:27,271
'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.

2136
02:27:27,271 --> 02:27:33,061
'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'orI'll have you executed.'

2137
02:27:33,061 --> 02:27:37,311
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup andbread-and-butter, and went down on one

2138
02:27:37,311 --> 02:27:39,001
knee.

2139
02:27:39,001 --> 02:27:45,001
'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.'You're a very poor speaker,' said the

2140
02:27:45,001 --> 02:27:46,842
King.

2141
02:27:46,842 --> 02:27:51,192
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, andwas immediately suppressed by the officers

2142
02:27:51,192 --> 02:27:55,402
of the court.(As that is rather a hard word, I will just

2143
02:27:55,402 --> 02:27:57,342
explain to you how it was done.

2144
02:27:57,342 --> 02:28:02,312
They had a large canvas bag, which tied upat the mouth with strings: into this they

2145
02:28:02,312 --> 02:28:07,522
slipped the guinea-pig, head first, andthen sat upon it.)

2146
02:28:07,522 --> 02:28:09,532
'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thoughtAlice.

2147
02:28:09,532 --> 02:28:14,462
'I've so often read in the newspapers, atthe end of trials, "There was some attempts

2148
02:28:14,462 --> 02:28:18,772
at applause, which was immediatelysuppressed by the officers of the court,"

2149
02:28:18,772 --> 02:28:22,602
and I never understood what it meant tillnow.'

2150
02:28:22,602 --> 02:28:26,802
'If that's all you know about it, you maystand down,' continued the King.

2151
02:28:26,802 --> 02:28:31,842
'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:'I'm on the floor, as it is.'

2152
02:28:31,842 --> 02:28:38,432
'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was

2153
02:28:38,432 --> 02:28:40,492
suppressed.

2154
02:28:40,492 --> 02:28:43,242
'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!'thought Alice.

2155
02:28:43,242 --> 02:28:46,312
'Now we shall get on better.'

2156
02:28:46,312 --> 02:28:50,782
'I'd rather finish my tea,' said theHatter, with an anxious look at the Queen,

2157
02:28:50,782 --> 02:28:53,832
who was reading the list of singers.

2158
02:28:53,832 --> 02:28:58,402
'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatterhurriedly left the court, without even

2159
02:28:58,402 --> 02:29:01,792
waiting to put his shoes on.

2160
02:29:01,792 --> 02:29:07,162
'--and just take his head off outside,' theQueen added to one of the officers: but the

2161
02:29:07,162 --> 02:29:12,222
Hatter was out of sight before the officercould get to the door.

2162
02:29:12,222 --> 02:29:14,902
'Call the next witness!' said the King.

2163
02:29:14,902 --> 02:29:19,832
The next witness was the Duchess's cook.She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and

2164
02:29:19,832 --> 02:29:24,292
Alice guessed who it was, even before shegot into the court, by the way the people

2165
02:29:24,292 --> 02:29:28,332
near the door began sneezing all at once.

2166
02:29:28,332 --> 02:29:33,402
'Give your evidence,' said the King.'Shan't,' said the cook.

2167
02:29:33,402 --> 02:29:38,152
The King looked anxiously at the WhiteRabbit, who said in a low voice, 'Your

2168
02:29:38,152 --> 02:29:42,932
Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'

2169
02:29:42,932 --> 02:29:48,362
'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said,with a melancholy air, and, after folding

2170
02:29:48,362 --> 02:29:53,102
his arms and frowning at the cook till hiseyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a

2171
02:29:53,102 --> 02:29:59,042
deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'

2172
02:29:59,042 --> 02:30:05,102
'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.

2173
02:30:05,102 --> 02:30:07,982
'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shriekedout.

2174
02:30:07,982 --> 02:30:10,292
'Behead that Dormouse!

2175
02:30:10,292 --> 02:30:13,292
Turn that Dormouse out of court!Suppress him!

2176
02:30:13,292 --> 02:30:17,002
Pinch him!Off with his whiskers!'

2177
02:30:17,002 --> 02:30:21,532
For some minutes the whole court was inconfusion, getting the Dormouse turned out,

2178
02:30:21,532 --> 02:30:26,582
and, by the time they had settled downagain, the cook had disappeared.

2179
02:30:26,582 --> 02:30:31,042
'Never mind!' said the King, with an air ofgreat relief.

2180
02:30:31,042 --> 02:30:33,292
'Call the next witness.'

2181
02:30:33,292 --> 02:30:39,482
And he added in an undertone to the Queen,'Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine

2182
02:30:39,482 --> 02:30:44,492
the next witness.It quite makes my forehead ache!'

2183
02:30:44,492 --> 02:30:48,702
Alice watched the White Rabbit as hefumbled over the list, feeling very curious

2184
02:30:48,702 --> 02:30:54,142
to see what the next witness would be like,'--for they haven't got much evidence YET,'

2185
02:30:54,142 --> 02:30:56,472
she said to herself.

2186
02:30:56,472 --> 02:31:01,032
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbitread out, at the top of his shrill little

2187
02:31:01,032 --> 02:31:08,894
voice, the name 'Alice!'

2188
02:31:08,894 --> 02:31:09,894
>

2189
02:31:09,894 --> 02:31:17,583
Chapter XII. Alice's Evidence

2190
02:31:17,583 --> 02:31:22,354
'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting inthe flurry of the moment how large she had

2191
02:31:22,354 --> 02:31:26,374
grown in the last few minutes, and shejumped up in such a hurry that she tipped

2192
02:31:26,374 --> 02:31:28,134
over the jury-box with the edge of her

2193
02:31:28,134 --> 02:31:33,074
skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to theheads of the crowd below, and there they

2194
02:31:33,074 --> 02:31:38,294
lay sprawling about, reminding her verymuch of a globe of goldfish she had

2195
02:31:38,294 --> 02:31:41,864
accidentally upset the week before.

2196
02:31:41,864 --> 02:31:47,383
'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in atone of great dismay, and began picking

2197
02:31:47,383 --> 02:31:51,694
them up again as quickly as she could, forthe accident of the goldfish kept running

2198
02:31:51,694 --> 02:31:53,834
in her head, and she had a vague sort of

2199
02:31:53,834 --> 02:31:58,084
idea that they must be collected at onceand put back into the jury-box, or they

2200
02:31:58,084 --> 02:32:00,464
would die.

2201
02:32:00,464 --> 02:32:05,894
'The trial cannot proceed,' said the Kingin a very grave voice, 'until all the

2202
02:32:05,894 --> 02:32:11,843
jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis,

2203
02:32:11,843 --> 02:32:16,054
looking hard at Alice as he said do.

2204
02:32:16,054 --> 02:32:20,103
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that,in her haste, she had put the Lizard in

2205
02:32:20,103 --> 02:32:24,414
head downwards, and the poor little thingwas waving its tail about in a melancholy

2206
02:32:24,414 --> 02:32:27,754
way, being quite unable to move.

2207
02:32:27,754 --> 02:32:33,164
She soon got it out again, and put itright; 'not that it signifies much,' she

2208
02:32:33,164 --> 02:32:37,084
said to herself; 'I should think it wouldbe QUITE as much use in the trial one way

2209
02:32:37,084 --> 02:32:40,034
up as the other.'

2210
02:32:40,034 --> 02:32:44,364
As soon as the jury had a little recoveredfrom the shock of being upset, and their

2211
02:32:44,364 --> 02:32:48,704
slates and pencils had been found andhanded back to them, they set to work very

2212
02:32:48,704 --> 02:32:51,424
diligently to write out a history of the

2213
02:32:51,424 --> 02:32:56,674
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemedtoo much overcome to do anything but sit

2214
02:32:56,674 --> 02:33:02,254
with its mouth open, gazing up into theroof of the court.

2215
02:33:02,254 --> 02:33:06,194
'What do you know about this business?' theKing said to Alice.

2216
02:33:06,194 --> 02:33:11,974
'Nothing,' said Alice.'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.

2217
02:33:11,974 --> 02:33:13,523
'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.

2218
02:33:13,523 --> 02:33:17,984
'That's very important,' the King said,turning to the jury.

2219
02:33:17,984 --> 02:33:21,894
They were just beginning to write this downon their slates, when the White Rabbit

2220
02:33:21,894 --> 02:33:26,494
interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majestymeans, of course,' he said in a very

2221
02:33:26,494 --> 02:33:31,144
respectful tone, but frowning and makingfaces at him as he spoke.

2222
02:33:31,144 --> 02:33:37,724
'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the Kinghastily said, and went on to himself in an

2223
02:33:37,724 --> 02:33:39,254
undertone,

2224
02:33:39,254 --> 02:33:42,674
'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which

2225
02:33:42,674 --> 02:33:46,894
word sounded best.Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,'

2226
02:33:46,894 --> 02:33:48,874
and some 'unimportant.'

2227
02:33:48,874 --> 02:33:53,124
Alice could see this, as she was nearenough to look over their slates; 'but it

2228
02:33:53,124 --> 02:33:57,134
doesn't matter a bit,' she thought toherself.

2229
02:33:57,134 --> 02:34:01,694
At this moment the King, who had been forsome time busily writing in his note-book,

2230
02:34:01,694 --> 02:34:07,444
cackled out 'Silence!' and read out fromhis book, 'Rule Forty-two.

2231
02:34:07,444 --> 02:34:12,574
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVETHE COURT.'

2232
02:34:12,574 --> 02:34:17,984
Everybody looked at Alice.'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.

2233
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:19,054
'You are,' said the King.

2234
02:34:19,054 --> 02:34:26,034
'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said

2235
02:34:26,034 --> 02:34:31,824
Alice: 'besides, that's not a regular rule:you invented it just now.'

2236
02:34:31,824 --> 02:34:33,884
'It's the oldest rule in the book,' saidthe King.

2237
02:34:33,884 --> 02:34:38,844
'Then it ought to be Number One,' saidAlice.

2238
02:34:38,844 --> 02:34:43,254
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.

2239
02:34:43,254 --> 02:34:46,713
'Consider your verdict,' he said to thejury, in a low, trembling voice.

2240
02:34:46,713 --> 02:34:52,684
'There's more evidence to come yet, pleaseyour Majesty,' said the White Rabbit,

2241
02:34:52,684 --> 02:34:57,394
jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paperhas just been picked up.'

2242
02:34:57,394 --> 02:34:58,984
'What's in it?' said the Queen.

2243
02:34:58,984 --> 02:35:04,124
'I haven't opened it yet,' said the WhiteRabbit, 'but it seems to be a letter,

2244
02:35:04,124 --> 02:35:07,264
written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'

2245
02:35:07,264 --> 02:35:12,404
'It must have been that,' said the King,'unless it was written to nobody, which

2246
02:35:12,404 --> 02:35:17,074
isn't usual, you know.''Who is it directed to?' said one of the

2247
02:35:17,074 --> 02:35:18,734
jurymen.

2248
02:35:18,734 --> 02:35:22,484
'It isn't directed at all,' said the WhiteRabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written

2249
02:35:22,484 --> 02:35:24,634
on the OUTSIDE.'

2250
02:35:24,634 --> 02:35:29,864
He unfolded the paper as he spoke, andadded 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a

2251
02:35:29,864 --> 02:35:34,394
set of verses.''Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?'

2252
02:35:34,394 --> 02:35:35,764
asked another of the jurymen.

2253
02:35:35,764 --> 02:35:42,514
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit,'and that's the queerest thing about it.'

2254
02:35:42,514 --> 02:35:46,984
(The jury all looked puzzled.)'He must have imitated somebody else's

2255
02:35:46,984 --> 02:35:49,114
hand,' said the King.

2256
02:35:49,114 --> 02:35:54,044
(The jury all brightened up again.)'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I

2257
02:35:54,044 --> 02:35:59,634
didn't write it, and they can't prove Idid: there's no name signed at the end.'

2258
02:35:59,634 --> 02:36:03,104
'If you didn't sign it,' said the King,'that only makes the matter worse.

2259
02:36:03,104 --> 02:36:07,514
You MUST have meant some mischief, or elseyou'd have signed your name like an honest

2260
02:36:07,514 --> 02:36:07,694
man.'

2261
02:36:07,694 --> 02:36:14,394
There was a general clapping of hands atthis: it was the first really clever thing

2262
02:36:14,394 --> 02:36:20,864
the King had said that day.'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.

2263
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:22,944
'It proves nothing of the sort!' saidAlice.

2264
02:36:22,944 --> 02:36:26,834
'Why, you don't even know what they'reabout!'

2265
02:36:26,834 --> 02:36:29,244
'Read them,' said the King.

2266
02:36:29,244 --> 02:36:34,364
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?'

2267
02:36:34,364 --> 02:36:36,664
he asked.

2268
02:36:36,664 --> 02:36:40,424
'Begin at the beginning,' the King saidgravely, 'and go on till you come to the

2269
02:36:40,424 --> 02:36:45,914
end: then stop.'These were the verses the White Rabbit

2270
02:36:45,914 --> 02:36:46,054
read:--

2271
02:36:46,054 --> 02:36:50,843
'They told me you had been to her,And mentioned me to him:

2272
02:36:50,843 --> 02:36:54,384
She gave me a good character,But said I could not swim.

2273
02:36:54,384 --> 02:36:58,604
He sent them word I had not gone(We know it to be true):

2274
02:36:58,604 --> 02:37:02,533
If she should push the matter on,What would become of you?

2275
02:37:02,533 --> 02:37:07,294
I gave her one, they gave him two,You gave us three or more;

2276
02:37:07,294 --> 02:37:11,044
They all returned from him to you,Though they were mine before.

2277
02:37:11,044 --> 02:37:15,254
If I or she should chance to beInvolved in this affair,

2278
02:37:15,254 --> 02:37:18,814
He trusts to you to set them free,Exactly as we were.

2279
02:37:18,814 --> 02:37:23,624
My notion was that you had been(Before she had this fit)

2280
02:37:23,624 --> 02:37:27,474
An obstacle that came betweenHim, and ourselves, and it.

2281
02:37:27,474 --> 02:37:31,714
Don't let him know she liked them best,For this must ever be

2282
02:37:31,714 --> 02:37:35,464
A secret, kept from all the rest,Between yourself and me.'

2283
02:37:35,464 --> 02:37:40,764
'That's the most important piece ofevidence we've heard yet,' said the King,

2284
02:37:40,764 --> 02:37:43,424
rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'

2285
02:37:43,424 --> 02:37:50,444
'If any one of them can explain it,' saidAlice, (she had grown so large in the last

2286
02:37:50,444 --> 02:37:55,944
few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid ofinterrupting him,) 'I'll give him sixpence.

2287
02:37:55,944 --> 02:38:00,063
<u>I</u> don't believe there's an atom ofmeaning in it.'

2288
02:38:00,063 --> 02:38:04,304
The jury all wrote down on their slates,'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of

2289
02:38:04,304 --> 02:38:08,134
meaning in it,' but none of them attemptedto explain the paper.

2290
02:38:08,134 --> 02:38:12,954
'If there's no meaning in it,' said theKing, 'that saves a world of trouble, you

2291
02:38:12,954 --> 02:38:15,424
know, as we needn't try to find any.

2292
02:38:15,424 --> 02:38:19,924
And yet I don't know,' he went on,spreading out the verses on his knee, and

2293
02:38:19,924 --> 02:38:25,873
looking at them with one eye; 'I seem tosee some meaning in them, after all.

2294
02:38:25,873 --> 02:38:33,614
"--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim,can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.

2295
02:38:33,614 --> 02:38:38,024
The Knave shook his head sadly.'Do I look like it?' he said.

2296
02:38:38,024 --> 02:38:43,364
(Which he certainly did NOT, being madeentirely of cardboard.)

2297
02:38:43,364 --> 02:38:47,434
'All right, so far,' said the King, and hewent on muttering over the verses to

2298
02:38:47,434 --> 02:38:54,164
himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that'sthe jury, of course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY

2299
02:38:54,164 --> 02:39:00,544
GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what hedid with the tarts, you know--'

2300
02:39:00,544 --> 02:39:06,224
'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROMHIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.

2301
02:39:06,224 --> 02:39:09,634
'Why, there they are!' said the Kingtriumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the

2302
02:39:09,634 --> 02:39:12,283
table.'Nothing can be clearer than THAT.

2303
02:39:12,283 --> 02:39:18,634
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" younever had fits, my dear, I think?' he said

2304
02:39:18,634 --> 02:39:22,783
to the Queen.'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing

2305
02:39:22,783 --> 02:39:25,783
an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.

2306
02:39:25,783 --> 02:39:30,313
(The unfortunate little Bill had left offwriting on his slate with one finger, as he

2307
02:39:30,313 --> 02:39:34,974
found it made no mark; but he now hastilybegan again, using the ink, that was

2308
02:39:34,974 --> 02:39:38,524
trickling down his face, as long as itlasted.)

2309
02:39:38,524 --> 02:39:44,884
'Then the words don't FIT you,' said theKing, looking round the court with a smile.

2310
02:39:44,884 --> 02:39:48,283
There was a dead silence.

2311
02:39:48,283 --> 02:39:54,533
'It's a pun!' the King added in an offendedtone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury

2312
02:39:54,533 --> 02:40:00,593
consider their verdict,' the King said, forabout the twentieth time that day.

2313
02:40:00,593 --> 02:40:01,923
'No, no!' said the Queen.

2314
02:40:01,923 --> 02:40:08,583
'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.''Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.

2315
02:40:08,583 --> 02:40:14,173
'The idea of having the sentence first!''Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning

2316
02:40:14,173 --> 02:40:14,573
purple.

2317
02:40:14,573 --> 02:40:20,283
'I won't!' said Alice.'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at

2318
02:40:20,283 --> 02:40:22,874
the top of her voice.Nobody moved.

2319
02:40:22,874 --> 02:40:30,343
'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she hadgrown to her full size by this time.)

2320
02:40:30,343 --> 02:40:33,864
'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

2321
02:40:33,864 --> 02:40:38,263
At this the whole pack rose up into theair, and came flying down upon her: she

2322
02:40:38,263 --> 02:40:43,143
gave a little scream, half of fright andhalf of anger, and tried to beat them off,

2323
02:40:43,143 --> 02:40:45,653
and found herself lying on the bank, with

2324
02:40:45,653 --> 02:40:50,583
her head in the lap of her sister, who wasgently brushing away some dead leaves that

2325
02:40:50,583 --> 02:40:52,944
had fluttered down from the trees upon herface.

2326
02:40:52,944 --> 02:40:59,393
'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister;'Why, what a long sleep you've had!'

2327
02:40:59,393 --> 02:41:06,194
'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' saidAlice, and she told her sister, as well as

2328
02:41:06,194 --> 02:41:10,573
she could remember them, all these strangeAdventures of hers that you have just been

2329
02:41:10,573 --> 02:41:13,153
reading about; and when she had finished,

2330
02:41:13,153 --> 02:41:18,653
her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS acurious dream, dear, certainly: but now run

2331
02:41:18,653 --> 02:41:20,283
in to your tea; it's getting late.'

2332
02:41:20,283 --> 02:41:26,374
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking whileshe ran, as well she might, what a

2333
02:41:26,374 --> 02:41:28,374
wonderful dream it had been.

2334
02:41:28,374 --> 02:41:34,374
But her sister sat still just as she lefther, leaning her head on her hand, watching

2335
02:41:34,374 --> 02:41:38,723
the setting sun, and thinking of littleAlice and all her wonderful Adventures,

2336
02:41:38,723 --> 02:41:44,573
till she too began dreaming after afashion, and this was her dream:--

2337
02:41:44,573 --> 02:41:49,043
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself,and once again the tiny hands were clasped

2338
02:41:49,043 --> 02:41:53,934
upon her knee, and the bright eager eyeswere looking up into hers--she could hear

2339
02:41:53,934 --> 02:41:56,233
the very tones of her voice, and see that

2340
02:41:56,233 --> 02:42:00,853
queer little toss of her head to keep backthe wandering hair that WOULD always get

2341
02:42:00,853 --> 02:42:06,163
into her eyes--and still as she listened,or seemed to listen, the whole place around

2342
02:42:06,163 --> 02:42:10,994
her became alive the strange creatures ofher little sister's dream.

2343
02:42:10,994 --> 02:42:15,763
The long grass rustled at her feet as theWhite Rabbit hurried by--the frightened

2344
02:42:15,763 --> 02:42:19,653
Mouse splashed his way through theneighbouring pool--she could hear the

2345
02:42:19,653 --> 02:42:22,033
rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and

2346
02:42:22,033 --> 02:42:27,013
his friends shared their never-ending meal,and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering

2347
02:42:27,013 --> 02:42:32,293
off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the

2348
02:42:32,293 --> 02:42:34,843
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes

2349
02:42:34,843 --> 02:42:40,073
crashed around it--once more the shriek ofthe Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's

2350
02:42:40,073 --> 02:42:44,543
slate-pencil, and the choking of thesuppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air,

2351
02:42:44,543 --> 02:42:49,184
mixed up with the distant sobs of themiserable Mock Turtle.

2352
02:42:49,184 --> 02:42:53,944
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and halfbelieved herself in Wonderland, though she

2353
02:42:53,944 --> 02:42:59,673
knew she had but to open them again, andall would change to dull reality--the grass

2354
02:42:59,673 --> 02:43:02,133
would be only rustling in the wind, and the

2355
02:43:02,133 --> 02:43:07,273
pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to

2356
02:43:07,273 --> 02:43:11,804
tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen'sshrill cries to the voice of the shepherd

2357
02:43:11,804 --> 02:43:14,673
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek

2358
02:43:14,673 --> 02:43:19,184
of the Gryphon, and all the other queernoises, would change (she knew) to the

2359
02:43:19,184 --> 02:43:23,573
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the

2360
02:43:23,573 --> 02:43:28,793
distance would take the place of the MockTurtle's heavy sobs.

2361
02:43:28,793 --> 02:43:32,913
Lastly, she pictured to herself how thissame little sister of hers would, in the

2362
02:43:32,913 --> 02:43:37,963
after-time, be herself a grown woman; andhow she would keep, through all her riper

2363
02:43:37,963 --> 02:43:40,073
years, the simple and loving heart of her

2364
02:43:40,073 --> 02:43:44,983
childhood: and how she would gather abouther other little children, and make THEIR

2365
02:43:44,983 --> 02:43:49,783
eyes bright and eager with many a strangetale, perhaps even with the dream of

2366
02:43:49,783 --> 02:43:52,744
Wonderland of long ago: and how she would

2367
02:43:52,744 --> 02:43:58,054
feel with all their simple sorrows, andfind a pleasure in all their simple joys,

2368
02:43:58,054 --> 02:44:04,083
remembering her own child-life, and thehappy summer days.

2369
02:44:04,083 --> 02:44:06,894
THE END

2370

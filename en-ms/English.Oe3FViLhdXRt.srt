1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440


2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,320
We're asked to solve for x.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,060
And we have 9x squared minus
42x, plus 29 is equal to

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,420
negative 20.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,560
Now, you might be tempted
immediately to try to factor

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,080
the left-hand side of this
equation to get the product of

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,870
two binomials, and that they
equal negative 20.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,180
But if you think about
it, that's not

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,370
going to help you much.

10
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,060
That product of two binomials
is only useful if they're

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,810
equal to 0.

12
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,750
Then you can say, well, one
or both of them need

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,850
to be equal to 0.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,240
But you can't make any statement
like that if they

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,960
both equal negative 20.

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,790
So the first thing we want to do
here is not to factor this

17
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,890
left-hand side, but to make sure
that we have a quadratic

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,840
equation equaling 0.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,680
We want a 0 on one side
of this equation.

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,830
And the best way I can think of
doing that is just to add

21
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,210
20 to both sides of
this equation.

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,000
So if we add 20 to both sides of
this equation, then we are

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,320
left with, on the left-hand
side, 9x squared minus 42x,

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,209
plus 49 is equal to 0.

25
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,390
Now we have a quadratic
expression equaling 0.

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,660
Now we have a nice quadratic
equation, and we can factor

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,820
this thing on the
left-hand side.

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,490
Now we could factor it by
grouping, but something might

29
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,790
immediately pop out at you.

30
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,170
And when you see numbers
like 9 and 49,

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,510
those are perfect squares.

32
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,440
So maybe this whole expression
is a perfect

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,080
square of some binomial.

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,760
So let's think about
it a little bit.

35
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,055
9 squared is 3x squared.

36
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:37,160


37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:45,370
And 49 is 7 squared, or
negative 7 squared.

38
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,810
And let's see, negative
42-- 3 times 7 is 21.

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,690
21 times 2 is positive 42.

40
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,020
But if we make this a negative
7, because negative 7 would

41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,820
also work, negative 7
squared is also 49.

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,950
Then 3 times negative 7,
times 2 is negative 42.

43
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,830
Let me write that down.

44
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,750
42 is 2 times 3, times
negative 7.

45
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,150
So this fits the pattern
of a perfect square.

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,210
So the left-hand side of this
equation, right here, we can

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:30,240
write it as 3x minus 7-- we
can write it as 3x minus 7

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,350
times 3x minus 7, or just
3x minus 7 squared.

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,510
And that is going to
be equal to 0.

50
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,460
Now, we essentially only have
one expression equaling 0,

51
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,400
times itself.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,080
So the only way that's going to
be equal to 0, is if that

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,700
expression is equal to 0.

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,400
3x minus 7 needs to
be equal to 0.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,700
And now we can just
solve for x.

56
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,130
Let's add 7 to both sides of
this equation, and we get 3x,

57
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,200
these cancel out,
is equal to 7.

58
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,410
Divide both sides by 3, and we
get x is equal to 7 thirds.

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,610
x is equal to-- let me just
write it here-- x is

60
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,920
equal to 7 over 3.

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200

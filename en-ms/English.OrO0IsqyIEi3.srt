Hi, my name is Jason Cornwell and I’m a User Experience Designer on Gmail. We’ve

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,420
been hard at work to update Gmail with a new look and I’m excited to share with you some

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,230
of the biggest improvements.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,590
To start, we’ve completely redesigned the look and feel of Gmail to make it as clean,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,539
simple and intuitive as possible. In addition, the new Gmail automatically adapts to fit

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:26,649
nicely in any size window. If you prefer a specific display density, you can easily set

7
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:31,149
that as well.

8
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,190
Some people use a lot of labels, others chat a lot. You can now adjust the size of the

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,570
label and chat areas to meet your needs.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,390
Even if you do nothing, Gmail adapts to you.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,780
The new look allows themes to really shine and we’ve updated many of them with new

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,210
high-resolution imagery. You may want to take a moment to check out one of the many new

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,469
high definition themes.

14
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:57,039
Conversations in Gmail have been redesigned to improve readability and to feel more like

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,629
a real conversation. We’ve also added profile pictures so you can see who said what.

16
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,180
Searching is at the heart of Gmail. The new search box makes it easy to customize your

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,909
search and find exactly what you’re looking for. You can also create a filter from the

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,810
search box.

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,680
We’re excited to finally share the new Gmail with you and hope you’ll enjoy the new design

20
00:01:21,680 --> 99:59:59,000
as much as we do.

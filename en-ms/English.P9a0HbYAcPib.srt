1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was a foolish little child

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Crazy things I used to do 

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And all the pain I put you through

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Mama now I'm here for you

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For all the times I made you cry

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The days I told you lies 

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now it's time for you to rise

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For all the things you sacrificed

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, if I could turn back time rewind

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I could make it undone 

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I swear that I would

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I would make it up to you 

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Mum I'm all grown up now 

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's a brand new day 

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mum I'm all grown up now 

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And it's not too late 

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day 

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And now I finally understand 

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Your famous line 

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
About the day I'd face in time 

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
'Cause now I've got a child of mine 

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And even though I was so bad 

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I've learned so much from you

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now I'm trying to do it too

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Love my kid the way you do 

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, if I could turn back time rewind

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If I could make it undone 

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I swear that I would

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I would make it up to you 

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, if I could turn back time rewind

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I could make it undone

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I swear that I would

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I would make it up to you

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mum I'm all grown up now 

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a brand new day 

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mum I'm all grown up now 

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And it's not too late 

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day 

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know you are the number one for me

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, oh, number one for me

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know you are the number one for me

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, oh, number one for me

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's no one in this world that can take your place

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh I'm sorry for ever taking you for granted

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ooh, I will use every chance I get

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To make you smile, whenever I'm around you

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now I will try to love you like you love me

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Only God knows how much you mean to me

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, if I could turn back time rewind

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If I could make it undone 

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I swear that I would

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I would make it up to you 

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mum I'm all grown up now 

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a brand new day 

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mum I'm all grown up now 

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it's not too late 

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day 

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Mum I'm all grown up now

62

It's a brand new day

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mum I'm all grown up now

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And it's not too late

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The number one for me

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, oh, number one for me

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720


2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,540
I received a problem
from Bradley.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,220
I don't know his last name.

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,300
I'm assuming it's a he.

5
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,050
I don't know where he lives.

6
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,670
But the problem he
gave is interesting.

7
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,980
And I don't think I've
covered this before.

8
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,090
So I think it's worth covering.

9
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,730
So the problem he gave, if I
read his note properly, is

10
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:25,310
this: 3 sine squared of x is
equal to 1 plus cosine of x.

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,730
So at first cut, this seems
like a difficult problem.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,270
How do I-- You
can't solve for x.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,350
You would have arcsines
and the square roots

14
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,950
and cosines et cetera.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,500
Et cetera.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,070
So the way I approached this
is-- Any time that if I see a

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,880
cosine x here but then I see a
sine squared x here, I start

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,860
thinking of what trig
identities are at my disposal.

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,970
And what trig identities
involve a sine squared x?

20
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,280
Well the most basic trig
identity, and this comes out

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,420
of the unit circle definition
of trig functions, is that

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,530
sine squared x plus cosine
squared x is equal to 1.

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,510
And that comes out of the fact
that the equation of a circle

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,500
is x squared plus y squared is
equal to the radius squared.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,100
But it's the unit circle.

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,650
It's equal to 1 squared.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,170
But anyway.

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,200
Hopefully you have this
memorized if you've already

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,410
been watching the trig videos.

30
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,070
So what does sine
squared x equal?

31
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,280
Well let's solve for it.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,270
So sine squared x is equal to 1
minus cosine squared x, right?

33
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,700
So we could substitute this
term right here with this.

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,630
And what does that get us?

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,880
Well we're just playing around
at this point, but at least

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,620
that way, everything is
in terms of cosine of x.

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,310
So let's do that.

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,860
Let's substitute.

39
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,680
So we get 3 times
sine squared of x.

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
We just showed that sine
squared of x is the same thing

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,075
as 1 minus cosine squared of x.

42
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:49,120


43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,730
Is equal to 1 plus cosine of x.

44
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,560
We can simplify a little bit.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:05,480
3 minus 3 cosine squared of x
is equal to 1 plus cosine of x.

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,910
I don't know.

47
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,990
Just for kicks, let's put
everything onto the right

48
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,550
side of the equation.

49
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,620
And you'll see it
wasn't just for kicks.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,870
0-- right?

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,230
I'm just going to --is equal
to-- let's put this onto

52
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,150
the right side --3
cosine squared x.

53
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,810
And then-- Let's see.

54
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,940
We have to subtract
3 from this side.

55
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,570
Well let's just
write the cosine x.

56
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,260
Plus cosine x.

57
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,400
And then 1 minus 3 is minus 2.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,910
Let me make sure I didn't
make a careless mistake.

59
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,870
We have negative 3 here.

60
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,493
We added 3 cosine x--
3 cosine squared of x

61
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:36,960
to both sides, right?

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,500
We subtracted 3
from both sides.

63
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,360
Minus 2 and this cosine
x is this cosine x.

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,950
Now what can we do?

65
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,410
Well this is where it
gets interesting.

66
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,740
Because this looks an awful lot
like a quadratic equation

67
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,920
except for the fact that
instead of having ax squared

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,400
plus bx plus c, we have
a cosine squared x.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360
So instead of just having an
x squared, we have a whole

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,940
cosine of x squared.

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,470
So what do I mean by that?

72
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,720
Let me make a substitution.

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,760
And then I think it'll
all become clear to you.

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,030
Let's make the substitution
that a-- and I'm just picking

75
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,430
the letter a arbitrarily
--is equal to cosine of x.

76
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,836
So if we were to take the
cosine x's of this and replace

77
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,450
them with a, what do we get?

78
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,760
And I'm just going to
switch it around.

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,790
So I want to put the
0 on that side.

80
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,340
Equal 0.

81
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,875
So we get 3-- Well
cosine squared x.

82
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,040
That's the same thing as
cosine of x squared, right?

83
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:47,840
So we get 3a squared plus
a minus 2 is equal to 0.

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,870
Well now we have a
pure quadratic.

85
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,500
And we can solve it using
the quadratic equation.

86
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,690
So what's the
quadratic equation?

87
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,760
Let me write it up here.

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,080
Negative b plus or minus
the square root of b

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,700
squared minus 4ac.

90
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,560
All of that over 2a.

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,550
So what are the roots
of this equation?

92
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,400
Well what's minus-- And
remember this a is

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,440
different than this a.

94
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,040
Maybe I shouldn't have
used a as a letter.

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,410
But these-- a, b, and c in
the quadratic equation

96
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,460
represent the coefficients.

97
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,360
So this is a.

98
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,500
b is 1.

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,340
And c is just minus 2.

100
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,080
So what are the roots of this?

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,780
So the a's that solve
this. a can equal--

102
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
And I know I confused you.

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,190
I could-- Let me actually
write it different.

104
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,630
Let's make this, instead of
a is equal to cosine x, let

105
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,610
me say that-- I don't know.

106
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,540
Let me pick a good letter
that's not involved in

107
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
the-- Let me say d.

108
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,920
So 3d squared plus
d minus is 2.

109
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,250
So now the a's, b's and c's are
definitely the coefficients.

110
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,390
So the solutions to this are
d-- because I didn't want to

111
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,060
use a, b, or c --d is
equal to minus b.

112
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,350
Well, b is 1.

113
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,730
Minus 1.

114
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,600
And if this is completely
foreign to you, you should

115
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,010
review the videos on
the quadratic equation.

116
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,560
Minus b squared.

117
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,690
Well that's 1 squared.

118
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,030
Minus 4ac.

119
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,220
So minus 4 times a,
times 3, times c.

120
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,590
Well c is minus 2, right?

121
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,630
So we get a-- That
minus cancels there.

122
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,780
And we have a 2 there.

123
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,550
All of that over 2 times a. a
is 3, so we have it over 6.

124
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,700
So this equals minus 1
plus or minus the square

125
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,250
root-- What is this?

126
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,480
4 times 3 times 2.

127
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
24 plus 1.

128
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,900
25.

129
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:35,950
Oh.

130
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,820
This works out cleanly.

131
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,290
Over 6.

132
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:46,160
So that equals minus 1
plus or minus 5 over 6.

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,480
And so what are the roots?

134
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,760
The roots are-- What's
minus 1 minus 5?

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,670
That's minus 6 over 6.

136
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,510
So it's minus 1.

137
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,420
What's the other one?

138
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,850
Minus 1 plus 5 is 4.

139
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,840
4 over 6 is 2/3.

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,260
So the solution is to
the equation-- Let me

141
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,490
clear up some space.

142
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,210
Hopefully it'll let me
clear up some space here.

143
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,150


144
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,600
Let me see.

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,170
What was I doing?

146
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,580
Oh.

147
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,780
Maybe I want to leave--
I can get rid of this.

148
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,210
You know the identity.

149
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,380
And you also know the
quadratic formula.

150
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,840
Let's see.

151
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,310
Actually, let me get
rid of this too.

152
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,860
Clear up a bunch of space.

153
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,410
I wanted to leave this here
because this showed how this

154
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,380
turned into a quadratic, but
instead of having it in terms

155
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,560
of just a variable, we have
it in terms of cosine of x.

156
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,550
And then we made this d
is equal to cosine of x.

157
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,030
Anyway.

158
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,970
So the solution to this
equation is that quadratic.

159
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:57,080
Is d is equal to minus
1 or 2/3, right?

160
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,700
But, of course, we made the
substitution long ago that

161
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,500
d is equal to cosine of x.

162
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,240
So the solution to this
equation, in terms of x, is the

163
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
solution to this equation.

164
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:17,500
Cosine of x is equal to minus 1
or cosine of x is equal to 2/3.

165
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,850
Well this one's easy, right?

166
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,590
x is equal to
arccosine of minus 1.

167
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,690
I always forget if there's two
c's when you do arccosine.

168
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,330
Anyway, so what-- At what
degree or radian value does the

169
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,020
cosine of x equal minus 1?

170
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,040
Well it's at pi, right?

171
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,895
So x could equal pi, which
is also or 180 degrees.

172
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,650


173
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,390
This one is not as easy.

174
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,010
I think I will have to use
a calculator for this.

175
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,330
Unless I'm-- whoops.

176
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,520
So you may not realize it,
but Google is actually

177
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,110
a calculator.

178
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,540
And a far more advanced
calculator than most.

179
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,555
So we could use Google
to figure out the

180
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:03,660
arccosine of 2/3.

181
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,790
Let's do that.

182
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,090
Arccosine-- and I don't
know if I'm spelling it

183
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,230
right --of 2 over 3.

184
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:21,370
Google tells us that it's
0.841 and a bunch of numbers.

185
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,160
So x is equal to
arccosine of 2 over 3.

186
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:35,070
So x is equal to 0.84106.

187
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,950
Let's see if they work.

188
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,660
Let's, just for fun, let's
just see if this one works.

189
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,180
Let's see if we substitute
pi into this equation we

190
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,320
get the correct answer.

191
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,810
Well what's sine of pi?

192
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,240
Let me erase all of this
is so we can check it.

193
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,140
I'm only going to check pi.

194
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,680
The 0.84.

195
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,220
And I don't know.

196
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,800
That's messy.

197
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
But you could do that
in your own time.

198
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,318
So let's check pi.

199
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,480
x equals-- No.

200
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,680
That's not what I wanted to do.

201
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,590


202
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,030
So what is-- Let's make
sure this works with pi.

203
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:17,510
3 sine squared of pi is equal
to 1 plus cosine of pi.

204
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,900
Well what's sine of pi?

205
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,570
This is equal to 3
sine of pi squared.

206
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,760
This is equal to 1
plus cosine of pi.

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,940
Well sine of pi is 0, right?

208
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,320
The y-value when you
go 180 degrees is 0.

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,180
So this is 0.

210
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,360
And what's cosine of pi?

211
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,890
Cosine of pi is negative 1.

212
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,100
So 1 plus minus 1.

213
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,400
Well this is true.

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,790
So pi worked in that equation.

215
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,600
I think if you substitute
that 0841068 whatever, you'd

216
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,990
also find that that works.

217
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,550
So thanks Bradley
for sending this.

218
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,430
I thought this was a neat
problem because it looks

219
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,660
like it's trigonometry.

220
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,190
And it was trigonometry but
you had to know a little

221
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,840
bit of identities.

222
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,020
And then you had to recognize
it as a quadratic equation.

223
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,590
I will see you in
a future video.

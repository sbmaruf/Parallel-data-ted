00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,100
For an art project, a pentagon
made of construction paper is

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,180
cut into five equal slices.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,210
Two of the slices are removed.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,540
Write the remaining portion of
the pentagon as a fraction.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,360
So let's draw ourselves
a pentagon.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,060
A pentagon is just a five-sided
figure, so

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,010
it looks like this.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,770
It's also where the Department
of Defense is located, a

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,450
building that's actually
in this shape.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,950
That's why they call
it the Pentagon.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,420
Let me draw it a little
nicer than that.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,050
It looks something like this.

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,400
Eh!

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,980
My pentagon drawing skills
need some work.

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,840
There you go.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,990
That's a pretty decent
shot at a pentagon.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,480
So that's the pentagon made
out of construction paper.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,140
Notice it has one, two, three,
four, five sides.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,310
That's why it's called
a pentagon.

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,840
And it's cut into five equals
slices, so we could do that.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,560
Maybe that's the center
of the pentagon.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,270
Here this is one slice
right there.

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,690
That is two slices, three
slices, four slices, and then

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,070
a fifth slice, so you
can imagine these

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,970
are all equal slices.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,736
Now, they're saying two of
the slices are removed.

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,310
So let's get rid of two
of these slices.

28
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,510
Let's say we remove that
slice up there.

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,750
Let's say we remove the
slice right next to

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,990
it right over there.

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,740
And then they want us to write
the remaining portion of the

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,990
pentagon as a fraction.

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,110
So what are the remaining
slices?

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,340
Well, I have this slice right
there, that slice right over

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,390
here and then this slice.

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:54,960
So you have three slices
remaining out of a total

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,610
possible of how many?

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,190
How many slices are in
the entire pentagon?

39
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,870
So if you look at the entire
pentagon, if you consider all

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,630
of the slices, we have
five slices.

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,120
So if you consider the entire
pentagon, it is made up of

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,680
five total slices.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,670
So it's three remaining out of
five total slices, so you

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:35,590
could say that 3/5 of
the pentagon remain.

45
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,170
Or you could say 2/5
were removed.

46
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,070
That's two of the five slices
were removed, and then three

47
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,410
are remaining, or 3/5 of
the pentagon remain.

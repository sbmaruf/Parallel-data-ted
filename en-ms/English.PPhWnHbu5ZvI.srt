1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870


2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,240
Now that we know what a solution
is, let's think a

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,510
little bit about what it takes
to get a molecule to be

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,050
soluble into a solution
or into a solvent.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,380
So let's say I start off with
a salt, and I'll do a little

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,840
side here, because in chemistry,
you'll hear the

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,080
word salt all the time.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,030
Let me right it down: salt.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,210
And in our everyday language,
salt is table salt.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,830
It makes food salty,
or sodium chloride.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,910


12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,500
And this indeed is both a salt
from the Food Channel point of

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,980
view and from the chemistry
point of view, although the

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,760
chemistry point of view does not
care about what it does to

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,030
season your food.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,325
The chemistry point of view, the
reason why it's called a

17
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,860
salt is because it's
a neutral compound

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,230
that's made with ions.

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,420
So we all know that this is
made when you take sodium.

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,770
Sodium wants to lose its one
electron in its valence shell.

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,330
Chloride really wants to
take it, so it does.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:08,010
Chloride becomes a negative ion
and sodium is a positive

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,110
ion, and they stick to each
other really strongly because

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,590
this guy's positive now, and
this guy's negative after he

25
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,930
took away his electron.

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,140
Imagine your house is too small,
so you have to give

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,930
away your dog to someone who has
room for the dog, but now

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,200
you have to hang out at that
person's house all the time

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,570
because they have the
dog you love.

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,560
I don't know if that analogy
was at all appropriate.

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,380
But I think you get the idea.

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,560
A salt is just any compound
that's neutral.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,820
The other common ones, potassium
chloride, you could

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,440
do calcium bromide, or I could
do a bunch of them, but these

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,080
are all salts.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,430
And what we want to think about
is what happens when you

37
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,660
try to essentially dissolve
these salts in water.

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,800
So we know what water is
doing, liquid water.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,170
So let me draw some
liquid water.

40
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,440
So if that's the oxygen and then
you have two hydrogens

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,302
that are kind of lumping off of
it, I'll draw it like that.

42
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:11,580
I'll draw a couple of them.

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,760
And then, of course, you have
another oxygen here.

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,370
Maybe the hydrogens are in this
orientation because the

45
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,910
hydrogen ends are attracted
through hydrogen bonds-- we've

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,700
learned this-- to the oxygen
ends because this has a slight

47
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,560
negative charge here, a slight
positive charge here.

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,200
These are the hydrogen
bonds that we've

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,720
talked so much about.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,270
And maybe you have another
oxygen here and it's got its

51
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,710
hydrogens there and there.

52
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,740
You have some hydrogen
bonds there.

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,310
I could do another oxygen here,
and you can kind of see

54
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,070
the structure that forms,
although what I'm drawing,

55
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,700
this is actually more of a-- if
you were in a solid state,

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,010
this would be kind of
rigid and they would

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,860
just vibrate in place.

58
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,260
In the liquid state, they're
all moving around.

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,590
They're rubbing up against
each other, but they're

60
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,670
staying very close.

61
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,340
Actually, the liquid state for
water is actually the most

62
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,950
compact state for water.

63
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,860
Now, when you're dealing with
stuff like this-- these are

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,380
moving around, maybe this guy's
moving that way, that

65
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,620
guy's moving that way-- and you
want to dissolve something

66
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,470
like sodium chloride.

67
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,620
Sodium chloride's actually
quite a large molecule.

68
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,740
If you look at the Periodic
Table up here, oxygen is a

69
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,310
Period 2 element.

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,740
Hydrogen is very small.

71
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,730
We know when it gets into a
hydrogen bond with oxygen,

72
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,610
it's really just a proton
sitting out there because all

73
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,060
the electrons like to hang out
with the oxygen, while, say,

74
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,390
sodium and chloride, they're
considerably larger.

75
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,240
I won't go into the exact
molecular sizes, but maybe

76
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,440
sodium-- let's do sodium--
which actually, just as a

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,920
review, which is larger.

78
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,150
We know that it becomes smaller
as you go to the right

79
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,450
of the Periodic Table, so sodium
is quite a large atom,

80
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,230
while chloride is a good bit
smaller, but they're both

81
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,030
bigger than oxygen and a lot
bigger than hydrogen.

82
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,000
So let me draw that.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,170
So sodium-- I'll do sodium
as a positive.

84
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,830
It's pretty big.

85
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,080
Maybe it looks like this.

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,800


87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,110
Sodium is positive and then
you have the chloride.

88
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,959
The chloride I'll
do in purple.

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,862
They're still pretty big.

90
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:25,050
The chloride, it'll
look like this.

91
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,460
And what happens when you
put it into water, it

92
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,330
disassociates.

93
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,780
Even though these guys in
a solid state, they're

94
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,440
jam-packed to each other.

95
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,930
When you put it into water,
the positive cations are

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,350
attracted to the negative
partial charges on the oxygen

97
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,110
side of the water, and the
negative anions are attracted

98
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,735
to the positive sides
of the hydrogen.

99
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:48,570


100
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,400
But in order to get, for
example, this sodium ion into

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
the water, it has
to fit in there.

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,560
So, for example, I drew this as
a liquid initially, but if

103
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,860
this was a solid and you had
this structure, it would be

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,000
extremely difficult.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,770
In fact, it would be next to
impossible to squeeze these

106
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,450
huge sodium ions in place
to make it soluble

107
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,140
into, say, solid ice.

108
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,540
And as even cold water, these
bonds are still going to be

109
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,560
pretty strong and they're
going to be just kind of

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,590
barely moving past each other
because there's not a lot of

111
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,285
kinetic energy.

112
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:23,710
So what you need to do is, the
warmer the water you have-- I

113
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,950
mean, you can fit it into cold
water, because at least cold

114
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,340
water has some give, but the
warmer the better, because you

115
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,590
have some kinetic energy, and
that essentially gives space.

116
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,085
Or it makes room for this sodium
ion that's entering in

117
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,960
to kind of bump its way into
a configuration that's

118
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,870
reasonably stable.

119
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,830
And a reasonably stable
configuration would look

120
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,460
something like this.

121
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,580
Sodium would look-- and then
you'd have a bunch of-- sodium

122
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,600
is positive.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,860
It would be attracted to the
negative end of the water

124
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,280
molecules, so the oxygen end.

125
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,950
So it looks like that, the
oxygen end, and then the

126
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,200
hydrogen ends are going
to be pointing

127
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,450
in the other direction.

128
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,445


129
00:06:06,445 --> 00:06:11,310
The hydrogen ends are going
to be on the other side.

130
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,370
And, of course, the chlorine
atom is going to be very

131
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,740
attracted to that other side, so
the chlorine atom might be

132
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,830
right over here.

133
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,360


134
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,570
So the chlorine atom might want
to hang out right here.

135
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,870


136
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,140
In order to get as much of the
sodium chloride into your

137
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,840
water sample, you want
to heat up the

138
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,220
water as much as possible.

139
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,380
Because what that does is it
allows these bonds to not be

140
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,160
taken as seriously and these
relatively huge atoms to kind

141
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,740
of bump their way in.

142
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:53,230
So, in general, if you think
about solubility of a solute

143
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,080
in water-- or especially if you
think of a solid solute,

144
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,740
which is sodium chloride-- into
a liquid solvent, then

145
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,860
the higher the temperature while
you're in the liquid

146
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,490
state, the more of the solid
you're going to be able to get

147
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,480
into the liquid, or you're going
to raise solubility.

148
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,110
So temperature goes up,
solubility goes up.

149
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,470
For example, if you were to take
some table salt, and you

150
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,450
could experiment with this.

151
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,235
It doesn't seem too dangerous
and not too expensive because

152
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,650
salt is reasonably cheap.

153
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,490
Keep putting it into
a glass, and at

154
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,280
some point it'll dissolve.

155
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,050
You could shake it a little
bit, just to make sure.

156
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,030
You could think about what's
happening at the molecular

157
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,280
level while you shake it and why
does that help to shake or

158
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,300
stir things?

159
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,390
But at some point, you're going
to end up with-- if this

160
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,080
is your glass of water, the salt
will keep going in there,

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,310
but at some point, you'll have
salt crystals at the bottom of

162
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,160
your glass.

163
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,290
At that point, your water is
saturated with salt at the

164
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,540
temperature that you're trying
to deal with it.

165
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,680
Now, right when you start seeing
that, if you were to

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,950
put it in the microwave or if
you were to heat it up, you

167
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,640
would see that even these guys
are able to be absorbed in the

168
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,290
water, and that's because the
extra kinetic energy from the

169
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,910
temperature is making it more
likely that these guys are

170
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,800
going to be able to bump out of
configuration for just long

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,260
enough for these guys
to bump in.

172
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,880
And just a little side note,
when you take these salts,

173
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,970
which are just ionic compounds
that are neutral, they're made

174
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,200
of ions, but they cancel
each other out.

175
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,650
When you put them in water,
these compounds by themselves

176
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,710
aren't normally-- when they're
in the solid state, they don't

177
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,080
normally conduct electricity.

178
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
Even though they're charged,
they're very closely stuck to

179
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,960
each other, so there's
not a lot of room

180
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,600
for movement of charge.

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,450
But once you disassociate them
in water or dissolve them in

182
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,610
water, now, all of a sudden,
you have these floating

183
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,040
charges in the water, and this
does conduct electricity, so

184
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,340
it becomes quite a reasonable
conductor of electricity.

185
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,710
So the general rule of thumb is,
if you're dealing with a

186
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,670
solid in a liquid solvent,
lowering the temperature will

187
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,340
decrease the solubility, because
it's harder to jam the

188
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,690
molecules in there, and
increasing the temperature

189
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,050
will increase the solubility.

190
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,960
But what about a gas?

191
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,090
What if you make some soda and
you want to dissolve some

192
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,270
carbon dioxide into, let's
say, water again?

193
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,110
So here, the way to think about
it when we did it with

194
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,760
salts, these are ionic
compounds.

195
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,670
They had some natural attraction
to the different

196
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,210
polar ends of the
water molecule.

197
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,210
But gases, for the most
part, do not have

198
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,420
strong attractive forces.

199
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,250
That's why they're gases,
especially at room

200
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,660
temperature.

201
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,680
They like to be free.

202
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,700
A gas, they have a good bit of
kinetic energy, but more

203
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,610
important, the bonds between
them, for example, in ideal

204
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,900
gases we talked about it, they
just have their London

205
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,810
dispersion forces.

206
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,640
They have very weak bonds, and
that's why at, say, the same

207
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,590
temperature and pressure that
water would be a liquid, a lot

208
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,180
of these gases are gases.

209
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,190
They jump away from each other
because they don't want to

210
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,520
touch each other.

211
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,950
Now, when you put this in
liquid, and this is at least

212
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,160
my intuition, so let's just say
this is a bunch of water

213
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,600
molecules here.

214
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,550
If you were to dissolve-- let's
say it's carbon dioxide.

215
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,460
You can ignore this
stuff up here.

216
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,210
If you were to dissolve carbon
dioxide in water-- so if you

217
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,300
were to dissolve this in water,
so those are some

218
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,700
carbon dioxide molecules.

219
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,260
I'm just drawing the whole
molecule as a circle.

220
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,880
What do these molecules
want to do?

221
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,530
It's natural state is a gas and
it is a gas at let's say

222
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,000
the standard pressure, so it
really wants to escape from

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,310
this water, but it just can't
do it that easily because

224
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,130
there's water molecules
all around it, right?

225
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,380
This guy right here, he might
want to bump out, but he's

226
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,630
surrounded by water molecules.

227
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,570


228
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,590
So what would help
him bump out?

229
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,140
Well, if you raise the average
kinetic energy of the system,

230
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,160
if you made all of these guys,
that these guys were moving

231
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,720
faster, and especially if the
carbon dioxide molecules

232
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,180
themselves had more kinetic
energy, then maybe

233
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,260
they could break out.

234
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,390
And as you have from personal
experience with Coke bottles,

235
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,470
you could also shake the system,
because if you shake

236
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,940
the system, it just moves
everything around enough that

237
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,500
these guys can escape.

238
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,860
So when you're dissolving
a gas inside of a liquid

239
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,140
solvent, when the solute is
a gas, it actually has the

240
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,420
opposite effect, that
rising temperature.

241
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,500
So when temperature goes up,
solubility goes down because

242
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,010
these guys want to escape.

243
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,980
They want to be free.

244
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,220
They want to be away from other
molecules and they want

245
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,500
to bounce around in open-- I
shouldn't use the word air--

246
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,100
in open space.

247
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,940
And so anything that lets the
system move around more,

248
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,550
they're going to go up.

249
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,570
And likewise, if temperature
goes down, solubility goes up.

250
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,890
The other factor, and it's not
as big of a factor when you

251
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,520
talk about a solid solute, but
when you talk about a liquid

252
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,720
solute-- let me just
do it again.

253
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,880
So those are the carbon dioxide
molecules and then you

254
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,730
have a bunch of water
molecules-- they should all be

255
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,630
the same size-- that
it's dissolved in.

256
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,730
I think you get the idea.

257
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,340
Pressure is also a big factor.

258
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,800
I already said that these guys,
their natural state is

259
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,480
to roam free.

260
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
They want to get out.

261
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,660
They want to somehow bounce
out of the water.

262
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,050
But if you have a really high
pressure up here-- just the

263
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,270
atmosphere up here has just
tons of molecules bouncing

264
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,590
really hard down on the surface
of our solution-- so

265
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,240
if there's just tons of
molecules bouncing really hard

266
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,180
off the surface, it'll
be harder for

267
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,360
anything to escape upwards.

268
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,950
And that's why, when you have
pressure going up, or at least

269
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,760
this is the intuition, when
pressure goes up, solubility

270
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,620
of a gas also goes up.

271
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,120
And this is for a gas.

272
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,040
So just the interesting thing
to remember is that when you

273
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,540
think about solubility, solids
do the inverse of gas.

274
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,000
Temperature is good for solid
solubility, right?

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,860
We said when you put salt or
sugar in water, it's good to

276
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,750
increase the temperature.

277
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,570
You'll be able put
more in there.

278
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,340
On the other hand, with a
gas, it's the opposite.

279
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,160
You want colder temperatures
to put more gas into the

280
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,710
solution, or you want higher
pressure to keep it-- at least

281
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,930
in the way my mind works-- from
escaping out the top.

282
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,240
Anyway, hope you found
that useful.

1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,670
What I want to do in this video
is a handful of fairly

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,470
simple inequality videos.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,710
But the real value of it, I
think, will be just to get you

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,750
warmed up in the notation
of inequality.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,390
So let's just start with one.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:19,590
So we have x minus 5
is less than 35.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,480
So let's see if we can find
all of the x's that will

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,940
satisfy this equation.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,370
And that's one of the
distinctions of an inequality.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,000
In an equation, you typically
have one solution, or at least

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,220
the ones we've solved so far.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,150
In the future, we'll see
equations where they have more

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,250
than one solution.

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,150
But in the ones we've solved
so far, you solved for a

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,310
particular x.

16
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,350
In the inequalities, there's a
whole set of x's that will

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,720
satisfy this inequality.

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,930
So they're saying, what are
all the x's, that when you

19
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,120
subtract 5 from them, it's
going to be less than 35?

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,170
And we can already
think about it.

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,690
I mean 0 minus 5.

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,290
That's less than 35.

23
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,310
Minus 100 minus 5.

24
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,750
That's less than 35.

25
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,160
5 minus 5.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,300
That's less than 35.

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,750
So there's clearly a lot of x's
that will satisfy that.

28
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,610
But what we want to do is come
up with a solution that

29
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,060
essentially encompasses
all of the x's.

30
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,640
So the way we do that is
essentially the same way that

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,960
we solved any equations.

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,610
We want to get just the x terms,
in this case, on the

33
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,720
left-hand side.

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,280
So I want to get rid of this
negative 5, and I can do that

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
by adding 5 to both sides
of this equation.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,350
So I can add 5 to both sides
of this equation.

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,930
That won't change
the inequality.

38
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,710
It won't change the
less than sign.

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,470
If something is less than
something else, something plus

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,720
5 is still going to be less than
the other thing plus 5.

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,580
So on the left-hand side,
we just have an x.

42
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,500
This negative 5 and this
positive 5 cancel out.

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,730
x is less than 35 plus
5, which is 40.

44
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,190
And that's our solution.

45
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,010
And to just visualize the
set of all numbers that

46
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,340
represents, let me draw
a number line here.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,280
And I'll do it around--
let's say that's 40,

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,250
this is 40, 41, 42.

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,730
And then we could go below 40.

50
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,389
39, 38.

51
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,240
You can just keep
going below 40.

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,700
It just keeps going on
in both directions.

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,610
And any x that is less than
40 will satisfy this.

54
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,950
So it can't be equal to 40,
because if x is equal to 40,

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,010
40 minus 5 is 35.

56
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,130
It's not less than 35.

57
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,820
So x has to be less than 40.

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,590
And to show this on the number
line, we do a circle around 40

59
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,620
to show that we're
not including 40.

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,020
But then we can shade in
everything below 40.

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,010
So everything that's just
exactly below 40 is included

62
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,770
in our solution set.

63
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,240
So everything I've shaded in
yellow is included in our

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
solution set.

65
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,530
So 39, 39.999999, repeating,
which is about as close as you

66
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,240
can get to 40 as possible,
that's in our solution set.

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,370
But 40 is not.

68
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,630
That's why we put that open
circle around it.

69
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,850
Let's do another one.

70
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,095
Let me do it in another
color as well.

71
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:06,860
So let's say we have x-- let
me do it over on this top

72
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,360
right corner.

73
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:16,320
Say we have x plus 15 is greater
than or equal to

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,570
negative 60.

75
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,220
Notice, now we have greater
than or equal.

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,110
So let's solve this the
same way we solved

77
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,830
that one over there.

78
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,360
We can subtract 15
from both sides.

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,800
And I like to switch
up my notation.

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,680
Here I added the 5, kind
of, on the same line.

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,460
You could also do your adding
or subtracting below

82
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,480
the line, like this.

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,130
So if I subtract 15 from both
sides, so I do a minus 15

84
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,170
there, and I do a
minus 15 there.

85
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,450
Then the left-hand side
just becomes an x.

86
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,110
Because obviously you
have 15 minus 15.

87
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,420
That just cancels out.

88
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,850
And you get x is greater than or
equal to negative 60 minus

89
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,000
15 is negative 75.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,050
If something is greater than or
equal to something else, if

91
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,830
I take 15 away from this and
from that, the greater than or

92
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,760
equal sign will still apply.

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,320
So our solution is x is greater
than or equal to

94
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,950
negative 75.

95
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,995
Let's graph it on
the number line.

96
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:13,060
So let me draw a number
line here.

97
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,310
I'll have-- let's say that's
negative 75, that's negative

98
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,310
74, that's negative 73,
that's negative 76.

99
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,450
And so on and so forth.

100
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,870
I could keep plotting things.

101
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,280
Now, x has to be greater than
or equal to negative 75.

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,590
So x can be equal
to negative 75.

103
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,470
So we can include the point,
because we have this greater

104
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,840
than or equal sign.

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,540
Notice we're not making it
hollow like we did there,

106
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,090
we're making it filled in
because it can equal negative

107
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,870
75, or it needs to
be greater than.

108
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,015
So greater than or equal.

109
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:52,340
We'll shade in everything above
negative 75 as well.

110
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,160
So in orange is the
solution set.

111
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,200
And this obviously, we could
keep going to the right. x

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,970
could be a million, it
could be a billion,

113
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,830
it could be a googol.

114
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,220
It can be an arbitrarily large
number as long as it's greater

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,090
than or equal to negative 75.

116
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,080
Let's do a couple more.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:17,940
Let's do x minus 2 is less
than or equal to 1.

118
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,650
Once again, we want to
get just our x on

119
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,440
the left-hand side.

120
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,830
Get rid of this negative 2.

121
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,400
Let's add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,410
Plus 2.

123
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,680
The left-hand side just
becomes an x.

124
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,400
You have a less than
or equal sign.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,130
That won't change by adding or
subtracting the same thing to

126
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,140
both sides of the inequality.

127
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,740
And then 1 plus 2 is 3.

128
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,010
So x needs to be less
than or equal to 3.

129
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,960
Any x that is less than
or equal to 3 will

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
satisfy this equation.

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,640
So let's plot it.

132
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,180
And I'd try out any x that's
less than or equal to 3 and

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,160
verify for yourself that it
does indeed satisfy this

134
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,740
inequality.

135
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,760
I shouldn't call
it an equation.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,790
This inequality.

137
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,520
So let me graph the
solution set.

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,140
So let's say this is
0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

139
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,830
That's negative 1, negative 2.

140
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,020
So x has to be less than
or equal to 3.

141
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,480
It can be equal to 3, so
we fill in the dot,

142
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
or less than 3.

143
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,730
So the solution set for
over here is in pink.

144
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,286
Anything less than
or equal to 3.

145
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,640
And verify it for yourself.

146
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,670
If x is equal to 3, you get 3
minus 2, which is equal to 1.

147
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,170
And that is valid because it
could be less than or equal.

148
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,950
If you do 2.999999 minus 2,
you get 0.999999, which is

149
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,920
less than 1.

150
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,500
And you can keep trying for any
of these numbers in this

151
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,280
pink solution set here.

152
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,370
Let's do one more.

153
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,830
Let's say we have x minus 32
is less than or equal to 0.

154
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,160
Same drill as before.

155
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,275
Let's add 32 to both sides
of this equation.

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,820
The left-hand side just becomes
x, and then the

157
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,650
right-hand side is less
than or equal to 32.

158
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,800
Pretty straightforward.

159
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,110
Same drill when we graph
this equation.

160
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,250
We draw the number line.

161
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,200
If this is 32, this
is 33, this is 31.

162
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,140
I could keep adding things
above and below 32.

163
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,000
For the solution set is
everything less than or equal,

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,410
so we can-- it could be equal
to 32, or less than.

165
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,580
So we fill in everything
below that.

166
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,790
Remember, the reason why we're
filling in this solid, the

167
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,960
reason why 32 is an acceptable
solution to this original

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,090
inequality, is because of this
less than or equal sign.

169
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,040
Over here, you didn't have less
than or equal, and that's

170
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,890
why 40 wasn't part of
the solution set.

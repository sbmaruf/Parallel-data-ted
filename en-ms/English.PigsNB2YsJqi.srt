1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:04,700
A carpenter is using a lathe
to shape the final leg of a

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,830
hand-crafted table.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,790
A lathe is this carpentry tool
that spins things around, and

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,480
so it can be used to make things
that are, I guess you

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,330
could say, almost cylindrical
in shape, like a leg for a

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,840
table or something like that.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,020
In order for the leg to fit, it
needs to be 150 millimeters

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,390
wide, allowing for a margin of
error of 2.5 millimeters.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,480
So in an ideal world, it'd be
exactly 150 millimeters wide,

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,030
but when you manufacture
something, you're not going to

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,870
get that exact number, so this
is saying that we can be 2 and

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,510
1/2 millimeters above or below
that 150 millimeters.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,910
Now, they want us to write an
absolute value inequality that

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,980
models this relationship, and
then find the range of widths

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,970
that the table leg can be.

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,780
So the way to think about this,
let's let w be the width

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,830
of the table leg.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,030
So if we were to take the
difference between w and 150,

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,690
what is this?

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,540
This is essentially how
much of an error

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,959
did we make, right?

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,170
If w is going to be larger than
150, let's say it's 151,

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,250
then this difference is going
to be 1 millimeter, we were

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,600
over by 1 millimeter.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,760
If w is less than 150, it's
going to be a negative number.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,160
If, say, w was 149, 149 minus
150 is going to be negative 1.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,110
But we just care about
the absolute margin.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,720
We don't care if we're above or
below, the margin of error

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,090
says we can be 2 and
1/2 above or below.

30
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,690
So we just really care about
the absolute value of the

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,730
difference between w and 150.

32
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,830
This tells us, how much of
an error did we make?

33
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,370
And all we care is that error,
that absolute error, has to be

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,950
a less than 2.5 millimeters.

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,980
And I'm assuming less than--
they're saying a margin of

36
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,830
error of 2.5 millimeters--
I guess it could be less

37
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,850
than or equal to.

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,960
We could be exactly 2 and
1/2 millimeters off.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,150
So this is the first part.

40
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,110
We have written an absolute
value inequality that models

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,920
this relationship.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,460
And I really want you
to understand this.

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,550
All we're saying is look, this
right here is the difference

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,680
between the actual width
of our leg and 150.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,310
Now we don't care if it's above
or below, we just care

46
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,430
about the absolute distance
from 150, or the absolute

47
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,590
value of that difference, so
we took the absolute value.

48
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,030
And that thing, the difference
between w a 150, that absolute

49
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,190
distance, has to be less
than 2 and 1/2.

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,300
Now, we've seen examples
of solving this before.

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,200
This means that this thing has
to be either, or it has to be

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,090
both, less than 2 and
1/2 and greater than

53
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,260
negative 2 and 1/2.

54
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,300
So let me write this down.

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:52,570
So this means that w minus 150
has to be less than 2.5 and w

56
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,450
minus 150 has to be greater than
or equal to negative 2.5.

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,150
If the absolute value of
something is less than 2 and

58
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,030
1/2, that means its distance
from 0 is less than 2 and 1/2.

59
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,490
For something's distance from
0 to be less than 2 and 1/2,

60
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,750
in the positive direction it has
to be less than 2 and 1/2.

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,600
But it also cannot be any more
negative than negative 2 and

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,880
1/2, and we saw that in
the last few videos.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,140
So let's solve each of these.

64
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,380
If we add 150 to both sides of
these equations, if you add

65
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,210
150-- and we can actually do
both of them simultaneously--

66
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,940
let's add 150 on this side,
too, what do we get?

67
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,910
What do we get?

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,360
The left-hand side of this
equation just becomes a w--

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,480
these cancel out-- is less than
or equal to 150 plus 2.5

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,690
is 152.5, and then we
still have our and.

71
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,360
And on this side of the
equation-- this cancels out--

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,750
we just have a w is greater than
or equal to negative 2.5

73
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,210
plus 150, that is 147.5.

74
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,270
So the width of our leg has
to be greater than 147.5

75
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,260
millimeters and less than
152.5 millimeters.

76
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,150
We can write it like this.

77
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,220
The width has to be less than or
equal to 152.5 millimeters.

78
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,090
Or it has to be greater than or
equal to, or we could say

79
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,730
147.5 millimeters is less
than the width.

80
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,810
And that's the range.

81
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,770
And this makes complete sense
because we can only be 2 and

82
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,460
1/2 away from 150.

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,330
This is saying that the distance
between w and 150 can

84
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,080
only at most be 2 and 1/2.

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,690
And you see, this is 2 and 1/2
less than 150, and this is 2

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,550
and 1/2 more than 150.

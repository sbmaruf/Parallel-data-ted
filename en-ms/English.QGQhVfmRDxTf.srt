1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's talk about a star search.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's assume we have the following grid.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The start state is right here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the goal state is right here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And just for convenience, I will give each here a little number.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A. B. C. D.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me draw a heuristic function.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Please take a look for a moment

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and tell me whether this heuristic function is admissable.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Check here if yes and here if no.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Which one is the first node a star would expand?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
B1 or A2?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's the second node to expand?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
B1, C1, A2, A3, or B2?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And finally, what is the third node to expand?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
D1, C2, B3, or A4?

Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
on his custom, five-string electric cello,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and it's very exciting to listen to him.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you ready to go? OK.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Just to make it a little bit more exciting.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All right. Take it away, Rufus.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:02:28,000
(Music)

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
All right. There you go.

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
(Laughter)

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
(Applause)

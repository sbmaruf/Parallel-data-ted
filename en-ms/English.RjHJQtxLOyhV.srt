1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
---

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,310
In the last video we took
essentially the length of y

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,620
equals x squared, not the
length, but we went from zero

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,340
to 1 on the x-axis and you
can view it as this area.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,710
And we rotated around the
y-axis to get this figure here

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,470
and we figured out the volume,
I think our answer if I

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,330
remember was pi over 2.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,160
And we use what I called
and what everyone calls

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,470
the Shell method.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,090
I want to show you that
you could actually use

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,740
the disk method here.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,880
But then we'll just have
to switch the ys and xs.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,230
Instead of writing this the
function as a function of x,

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,500
we'll just take the
inverse of it and write it

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,320
as a function of y.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,270
so this curve y equals x
squared, what it can also be

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,900
written as, we can just take
the squared root of both

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,620
sides as x is equal to
the square root of y.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,630
Just take the square
root of both sides.

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,440
And now we can use this
information to do the disk

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,650
method, but everywhere where
we had an x in the past

22
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,500
we'll now have a y.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,560
So let's think about
how we would do it.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,240
Once again it's this area--
really the hardest thing about

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,110
all of these problems is
just the visualization.

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,040
I think that's why they do it.

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,230
Just to make sure that you know
how to visualize things and

28
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,560
maybe understand the calculus.

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,490
It's more visualization
then calculus really.

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,060
So we're still dealing with--
if we take a cross section, if

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,270
we were to cut this figure this
area would be the

32
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,885
cross section.

33
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,930
And we're still rotating around
the y-axis just like we

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,900
did in the last video.

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,290
We're still rotation around the
y-axis, we get this figure.

36
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,420
So how would we
deal with disks.

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,266
Well a disk would look like
this at some point-- let

38
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,690
me pick another color.

39
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,540
At some point we'd have
a disk like that.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,330
That would be the top of the
disk, and it would have some

41
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,520
depth like we did before.

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,310
And its height, or the
radius of that disk,

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,220
would be equal to x.

44
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,230
It's equal to x.

45
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,640
I know you're thinking it
looks like the shell method.

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,980
But what is x equal to?

47
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,130
It's equal to the
square root of y.

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,160
It equals the square root of y.

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,810
And what would be the
width of that disk?

50
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,400
Now we are making everything as
a function of y, so the width

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,430
would be just a very small
distance d y, the

52
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,420
differential y.

53
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,500
That's essentially
all we need to know.

54
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,870
So the volume of that disk
would be the radius squared

55
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,670
times pi times d y.

56
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,070
Hopefully that makes a little
bit sense, but there's another

57
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,070
hitch on this problem.

58
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,200
This is actually similar to
what we did two videos ago.

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,750
Because when you view it in the
y-axis, from this y frame of

60
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,440
reference, what we're going to
do is we're going to take the

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,660
volume, we take the volume
of x is equal to 1.

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,190
So what would be the volume
of x is equal to 1 rotated

63
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,100
around the x-axis?

64
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,933
It would just be the
entire cylinder.

65
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,410
It's really important
that you visualize this

66
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,780
right, what we're doing.

67
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,400
We're going to figure
out this volume, volume

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,740
of x is equal to 1.

69
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,990
Let me draw the axis just so
you know what we're doing.

70
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:30,240
So this would be the y-axis,
that would be the x-axis

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,220
as best as I can draw.

72
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,660
Originally, we can figure
out the volume of

73
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,240
the entire cylinder.

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,740
This is x is equal to 1, x is
equal to 1 from what y points?

75
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,960
From the point,
well what is this?

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,760
This is y equals 1.

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,930
y equal 1 to zero.

78
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,230
So we would figure out this
volume from y equals 1 to zero.

79
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,000
And how would we do that?

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,750
What would be the integral?

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,390
Remember everything is in
y now, so it might seem

82
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,660
a little confusing.

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,180
For each of these disks, this
is going to be made up of

84
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,860
a bunch of disks, let
me draw one of them.

85
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,060
Let me draw the top one.

86
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,170
The top disk, and it has a
width, it's not going to be

87
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,600
this entire cylinder, its
width is d y, its width

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,410
is just going to be this.

89
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,560
d y, a very small sliver.

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,160
d y, and its radius is x
or you could say f of y.

91
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,040
What would be the
volume of that disk?

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,290
What would be the surface
area of the top?

93
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,350
It would be f of y squared.

94
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,740
Remember we're dealing
everything with y. f of y

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,410
squared times pi, that
gives the area of the top.

96
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,510
Put the pi outside of
the integral times d y.

97
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,700
d y, and we said y is
going from zero to 1.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,800
y is going from zero to 1.

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,130
So that's that entire cylinder.

100
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,860
And what we'll want to do is
subtract out, essentially cut

101
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,010
out the volume of
the inner bowl.

102
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,730
So minus.

103
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,580
How would we figure
out the inner bowl?

104
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,410
That's where we will deal
with the x is equal to the

105
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,240
square root of y function.

106
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,650
Because here, what's each disk?

107
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,830
Once again it's f of y.

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,980
I wrote this generally, this
is f of y of the outside.

109
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,890
I'm going to now do
it for the inside.

110
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,980
I'm going to cut out the inside
volume and because I kept

111
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,160
it general I could do it.

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,360
We're still going from
zero to 1, from y equals

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,640
zero to y equals 1.

114
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,070
Remember we're
doing with y now.

115
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,490
I will take f of the inside
f of y squared d of y.

116
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,720
You can imagine in this case
the inside function, we're

117
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,850
going to take the volume.

118
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,890
That original disk I drew is
actually one of the disks

119
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,260
for the inside function.

120
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,640
Where the height of that disk
is d y, that should be d y.

121
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,050
The radius of the
disk is f of y.

122
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,260
And of course the area of
the top of the desk is pi

123
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,160
times the radius squared.

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,840
How do we apply it to this
particular situation?

125
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,140
What is the outside function?

126
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,790
f of y, x is equal to f of y.

127
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,370
We are just switching
the variables.

128
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,840
We say that x is equal to 1.

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,590
This is just a big
cylinder, right?

130
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,306
So f of i is equal go to 1 in
this function, so we get pi--

131
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:28,420
let me switch colors--
times from zero to 1.

132
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,530
1 squared d y minus pi,
and we're still going

133
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,170
from zero to 1.

134
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,050
Remember, that's
the y boundaries.

135
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,570
What's f of y?

136
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:51,540
Here f of y is square
root of y squared d y.

137
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,440
Let's take the pi out.

138
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,280
So pi times, well
1 squared is 1.

139
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,060
What's the
anti-derivative of 1?

140
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,580
What function's
derivative is 1?

141
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,371
It's x, right?

142
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:13,110
x, that's the
anti-derivative there.

143
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,600
We can merge these.

144
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,120
We took the pi out.

145
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,210
This square root of y
squared, this is just y.

146
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,880
Sorry, we have that
derivative 1.

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,780
See, even I get quite
confused here.

148
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,550
We're taking this with
respect to y, right?

149
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,200
The anti-derivative
of 1 now is y.

150
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,930
We are setting up
a bunch of ys.

151
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,700
I find this even a little
perplexing when I start

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,580
switching x and y.

154
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,980
The second function.

155
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,540
Remember, we can merge these
because it's the same

156
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,520
boundaries and they're
both in respect to y.

157
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,330
Square root of y squared is y.

158
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,940
What's the anti-derivative of
y, the function y or y d y.

159
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,320
Was y squared over 2,
minus y squared over 2.

160
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,490
We are going to evaluate
that at 1 and zero.

161
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,000
So what does that get us?

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,680
We get pi-- we get 1 minus
1/2 minus zero minus zero

163
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,290
minus zero plus 0/2.

164
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,600
Whatever these are zero.

165
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,870
1 minus 1/2 that's
1/2 and times pi is

166
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,540
equal to pie over 2.

167
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,930
Which is the exact same result.

168
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,010
And I was worried, because you
never know when you might make

169
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,940
a careless mistake
as I often do.

170
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,650
We got the exact same result as
I got in the previous video

171
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,850
when we used the shell method.

172
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,050
The hardest thing here is just
remembering that you're doing

173
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,080
everything in terms of y.

174
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,710
When we did the disk method
traditionally, the disks

175
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,050
were vertical disks.

176
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,930
Now they're horizontal disks
but it's the exact same thing.

177
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,900
You just have to get your brain
around the idea that we're

178
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,780
dealing with the ys, that the
boundaries on the integrals

179
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,360
are now y values.

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,630
We're taking the width of the
disks, or the height of the

181
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,890
disks are d y and the radius
is now the function of y.

182
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,730
Hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

183
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,890
My own brain malfunctioned
a bit when I took the

184
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,740
anti-derivative of 1 d y,
it should have been y.

185
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,900
I will see you in the next
video where we will do even

186
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,290
more complicated problems,
where I'm sure I'll make

187
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,970
even more mistakes.

188
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,710
See you soon.

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And that might seem a bit surprising because

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
about the things that we need to invent and deliver

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to help the poorest two billion live better lives.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people --

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There will be too much rain, not enough rain,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
things will change in ways

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that their fragile environment simply can't support.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Also, the price of energy is very important to them.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, the price of energy has come down over time.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we can make modern materials and do so many things.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we need to meet a new constraint,

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and that constraint has to do with CO2.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
CO2 is warming the planet,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that leads to a temperature increase,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and so you get ecosystem collapses.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now, the exact amount of how you map

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and where the positive feedbacks are,

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but they will be extremely bad.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I asked the top scientists on this several times:

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do we really have to get down to near zero?

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the answer is that until we get near to zero,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the temperature will continue to rise.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And so that's a big challenge.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's very different than saying "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and we can just sort of squeeze under."

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is something that has to get to zero.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
over 26 billion tons.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
For each American, it's about 20 tons;

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And, somehow, we have to make changes

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that will bring that down to zero.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's been constantly going up.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
so we have to go from rapidly rising

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to falling, and falling all the way to zero.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This equation has four factors,

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
a little bit of multiplication:

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and that's going to be based on the number of people,

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the services each person's using on average,

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the energy on average for each service,

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, let's look at each one of these

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and see how we can get this down to zero.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now that's back from high school algebra,

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but let's take a look.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
First, we've got population.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The world today has 6.8 billion people.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's headed up to about nine billion.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
health care, reproductive health services,

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
but there we see an increase of about 1.3.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The second factor is the services we use.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This encompasses everything:

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
These are very good things:

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
getting rid of poverty means providing these services

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to almost everyone on the planet.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we probably could cut back and use less,

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and so, over all, that will more than double

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the services delivered per person.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here we have a very basic service:

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and reading their school work under the street lamps.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
here finally we have some good news.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We have something that's not going up.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
there are a lot of services where you can bring

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the energy for that service down quite substantially.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There are other services like how we make fertilizer,

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
or how we do air transport,

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But for these first three factors now,

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and that just won't cut it.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So let's look at this fourth factor --

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
this is going to be a key one --

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you burn coal, no.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you burn natural gas, no.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Almost every way we make electricity today,

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is create a new system.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And so, we need energy miracles.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The Internet and its services are a miracle.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Usually, we don't have a deadline,

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is there some kind of natural illustration,

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and somehow people enjoyed that.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
(Laughter)

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It really got them involved in the idea of,

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I decided that releasing fireflies

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
would be my contribution to the environment here this year.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So here we have some natural fireflies.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
(Laughter)

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but they don't really add up to much.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We need solutions -- either one or several --

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that have unbelievable scale

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and unbelievable reliability,

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and, although there's many directions people are seeking,

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Those may make some contribution,

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but my key point here

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
is that we're going to have to work on each of these five,

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because they all have significant challenges.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
either burning coal or burning natural gas.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and hope it stays there.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
but the toughest one here is this long-term issue.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who's going to be sure?

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is a lot of volume.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So that's a tough one.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Next would be nuclear.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It also has three big problems:

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that, even though you have these human operators,

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And then what do you do with the waste?

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
People need to feel good about it.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So three very tough problems that might be solvable,

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and so, should be worked on.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The last three of the five, I've grouped together.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
they have some disadvantages.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
is dramatically less than a power plant.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Also, these are intermittent sources.

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And so, if you depend on these sources,

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
you have to have some way of getting the energy

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
during those time periods that it's not available.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So, we've got big cost challenges here,

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
we have transmission challenges:

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
for example, say this energy source is outside your country;

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you not only need the technology,

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And, finally, this storage problem.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
all the types of batteries that get made --

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and what I found is that all the batteries we make now

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
something that's going to be a factor of 100 better

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
than the approaches we have now.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you're counting on it for 100 percent,

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
you need an incredible miracle battery.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach?

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." That's good.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And, I think, here in the TED group,

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
we have many people who are already pursuing this.

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that has some great solar thermal technologies.

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and I'm trying to help back that.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the one percent, which is the U235 --

239
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238."

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It is kind of a crazy idea.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that now you can simulate and see that, yes,

245
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And, because you're burning that 99 percent,

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
you have greatly improved cost profile.

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel

249
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
all the leftover waste from today's reactors.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is the leftover, the 99 percent,

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
where they've taken out the part they burn now,

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
so it's called depleted uranium.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
that we need to move forward.

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves?

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What should our report card look like?

266
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and then look at the intermediate.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That really is very important, that we get there.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
still some agriculture,

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So, to get to that 80 percent,

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the developed countries, including countries like China,

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
have we deployed it in all the developed countries

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere?

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's super important.

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's a key element of making that report card.

281
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?

282
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, again, it should have the two elements.

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and, therefore, the less the temperature.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But in some ways, the grade we get there,

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and we can measure that in terms of companies,

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.

293
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.

294
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice"

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."

296
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They really go through it and create a framework

297
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
that this can be discussed broadly,

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
because we need broad backing for this.

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
There's a lot that has to come together.

300
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So this is a wish.

301
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.

302
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --

303
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I could pick who's president,

304
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,

305
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
or I could pick that this thing

306
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
this is the wish I would pick.

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is the one with the greatest impact.

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If we don't get this wish,

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse.

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So, what do we have to do?

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?

315
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We need to go for more research funding.

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They should discuss this innovation agenda,

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
on these innovative approaches.

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --

322
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
something that gets that price signal out there.

323
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We need to get the message out.

324
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
including the steps that the government takes.

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Thank you.

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:35,000
(Applause)

329
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you.

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
(Applause)

332
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right --

333
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
hire all the great scientists, which we've done,

336
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that's only tens of millions,

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor

338
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
to make sure that our materials work properly,

339
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor;

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location

342
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that will actually build the first one of these.

343
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,

344
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,

345
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
are so different than nuclear as we know it.

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
of this sort of spent uranium,

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?

350
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,

351
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong:

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out,

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
that's not good.

354
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --

355
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
just think of it as a log --

356
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
put it down and not have those same complexities.

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,

360
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
then you can actually take that,

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and put it into another one and burn that.

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that's our fuel to begin with.

366
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors

367
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
is actually what gets fed into ours,

368
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
as you're going through this process.

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world

371
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
about the possibilities here.

372
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?

373
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,

374
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear,"

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
so we've got a lot of interest,

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China --

377
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,

378
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.

379
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work.

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is a variant on something that has been done.

381
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,

382
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and a lot of countries have built them,

383
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood

385
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
of actually taking something like this live?

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things

387
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
that's very cheap,

388
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.

389
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
have shown us that we have to meet.

391
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot --

392
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
could easily meet that.

393
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --

394
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
we need it to be hundreds --

395
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
who, likewise, if their science goes well,

396
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,

397
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that they can compete for this.

398
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And it's best if multiple succeed,

399
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
because then you could use a mix of these things.

400
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We certainly need one to succeed.

401
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changes,

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.

404
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,

405
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.

406
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.

407
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,

408
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but the modular people, that's a different approach.

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,

410
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
but maybe they say that about us.

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And so, there are different ones,

412
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium

413
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,

414
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and so -- if you can deal with the negatives,

415
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
which are essentially the radiation --

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
the footprint and cost, the potential,

417
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
in terms of effect on land and various things,

418
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
is almost in a class of its own.

419
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
CA: If this doesn't work, then what?

420
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Do we have to start taking emergency measures

421
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?

422
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
BG: If you get into that situation,

423
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack:

424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.

425
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,

426
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
which are various techniques that would delay the heating

427
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Now, that's just an insurance policy.

429
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You hope you don't need to do that.

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy

431
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
because it might make you lazy,

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.

433
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,

434
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
but there's now the geoengineering discussion

435
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,

436
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?

437
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them,

438
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
how might you persuade them that they're wrong?

439
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.

440
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few.

441
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects

442
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
that have to do with clouds that offset things?

443
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There are very, very few things that they can even say

444
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
there's a chance in a million of those things.

445
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS.

446
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.

447
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,

448
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,

449
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and a somewhat uncertain pain thing --

450
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case,

451
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC

452
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal."

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.

454
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,

455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and meet the CO2 constraints,

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
then the skeptics say, "OK,

457
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,

458
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I kind of wish it did put out CO2,

459
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before."

460
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
(Applause)

461
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument,

462
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,

463
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
it's going to take away all your other goals

464
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,

465
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that

466
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
when there are better things we can do.

467
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece --

468
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --

469
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
it's not that dramatic.

470
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It shouldn't take away from other things.

471
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree,

472
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that --

473
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that, to me, mostly is a waste.

474
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve

475
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and it's going to get very cheap,

476
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I believe we should try more things that have a potential

477
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to be far less expensive.

478
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
then the rich can afford that.

480
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy

481
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and not change our lifestyle.

482
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The disaster is for that two billion.

483
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And even Lomborg has changed.

484
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?"

485
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He's still, because of his earlier stuff,

486
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
still associated with the skeptic camp,

487
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,

488
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and so, he's making the R&D point.

489
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.

490
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The R&D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded.

491
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
CA: Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here

492
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.

493
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
BG: Thank you.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
(Applause)

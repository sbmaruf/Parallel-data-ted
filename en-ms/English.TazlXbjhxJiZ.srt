1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I grew up to study the brain

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder:

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
schizophrenia. And as a sister

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand, why

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What is it about my brother's brain and

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
dreams to a common and shared reality, so they

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
instead become delusion?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So I dedicated my career to research into the

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the lab of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab, we were asking the question,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
"What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
who would be diagnosed as normal control,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
of the brain: which cells are communicating with

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which cells, with which chemicals, and then in

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
what quantities of those chemicals?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
this type of research during the day.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But then in the evenings and on the weekends,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And in the course of four hours,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I essentially became an infant in a woman's body.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you've ever seen a human brain,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I have brought for you a real human brain.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this is a real human brain.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the front of the brain,

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
For those of you who understand computers,

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor,

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The two hemispheres do communicate with one another

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
through the corpus collosum,

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But other than that,

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the two hemispheres are completely separate.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because they process information differently,

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
each of our hemispheres think about different things,

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
they care about different things, and, dare I say,

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
they have very different personalities.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's all about "right here, right now."

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
through all of our sensory systems

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and then it explodes into this enormous collage

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
of what this present moment looks like,

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
what this present moment smells like and tastes like,

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
what it feels like and what it sounds like.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
through the consciousness of my right hemisphere.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We are energy-beings connected to one another

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And right here,

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet,

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
here to make the world a better place.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Our left hemisphere

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is all about the past and it's all about the future.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Our left hemisphere is designed to take that

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
enormous collage of the present moment and start

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
picking out details, details and more details about those details.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It then categorizes and

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
organizes all that information, associates it

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
with everything in the past we've ever learned, and

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
projects into the future all of our possibilities.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And our left hemisphere thinks in language.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
internal world to my external world.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you gotta remember

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to pick up bananas on your way home.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I need them in the morning."

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
it's that little voice that says to me,

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
"I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am,"

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I become separate.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
around me and separate from you.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
on the morning of my stroke.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of pain --

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
caustic pain -- that you get when you

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me --

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then it released me. And then it just gripped me --

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and then it released me. And it was very unusual

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for me to ever experience any kind of pain,

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start my normal routine."

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider,

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
which is a full-body, full-exercise machine.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that my hands look like primitive claws grasping

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar."

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And I looked down at my body and I thought, "Whoa,

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
my consciousness had shifted away from my normal

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
perception of reality, where I'm the person on the

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
machine having the experience, to some esoteric space

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
where I'm witnessing myself having this experience.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
just getting worse. So I get off the machine,

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and I'm walking across my living room floor, and I

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
realize that everything inside of my body has

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
slowed way down. And every step is very rigid and

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace,

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and there's this constriction in my area of perceptions,

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
so I'm just focused on internal systems.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
step into the shower, and I could actually hear the

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
saying, "OK. You muscles, you gotta contract.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You muscles, you relax."

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And  then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And I look down at my arm and I realize

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't define where I begin and where I end,

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because the atoms and the molecules of my arm

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And all I could detect was this energy -- energy.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I'm asking myself, "What is wrong with me?

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is going on?" And in that moment, my brain chatter --

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
my left hemisphere brain chatter -- went totally silent.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Just like someone took a remote control

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and pushed the mute button. Total silence.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And at first I was shocked to find myself

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And because I could no longer identify

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I felt at one with all the energy that was,

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and it was beautiful there.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
online, and it says to me, "Hey! We got a problem!

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We got a problem! We gotta get some help."

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I'm going, "Ahh! I got a problem.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I got a problem." So it's like, "OK. OK. I got a problem."

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But then I immediately drifted right back

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
refer to this space as La La Land.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
be like to be totally disconnected from your brain

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
chatter that connects you to the external world.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So here I am in this space, and my job -- and any

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
stress related to my job -- it was gone.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
all of the relationships in the external world and any

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
stressors related to any of those -- they were gone.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage!

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
euphoria. It was beautiful.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then, again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says,

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I got to get help.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I gotta focus."

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So I get out of the shower and I mechanically

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
dress and I'm walking around my apartment,

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and I'm thinking, "I gotta get to work. I gotta get to work.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Can I drive? Can I drive?"

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And in that moment my right arm went totally

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized,

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
"Oh my gosh! I'm having a stroke! I'm having a stroke!"

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And the next thing my brain says to me is, "Wow!

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is so cool." (Laughter) "This is so cool!

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How many brain scientists have the opportunity

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to study their own brain from the inside out?"

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
(Laughter)

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And then it crosses my mind, "But I'm a very busy woman!"

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
(Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!"

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop the stroke from happening,

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
so I'll do this for a week or two, and

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
then I'll get back to my routine. OK.

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I gotta call help. I gotta call work."

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I couldn't remember the number at work,

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
so I remembered, in my office I had a business card

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
with my number on it. So I go into my business room,

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I'm looking at the card on top and even though

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like,

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I couldn't tell if this

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And the pixels of the words blended

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and I just couldn't tell.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And in that moment, I would be able to

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
reattach to normal reality and I could tell

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that's not the card ... that's not the card ... that's not the card.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
inside of that stack of cards.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
getting bigger in my left hemisphere.

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone,

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but it's the only plan I have.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here. I take the business card,

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I put it right here, and

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But then I would drift back out into La La Land,

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and not remember when I came back if I'd already

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
dialed those numbers.

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
them, so that as I would come back to normal

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes, I've already dialed that number."

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and I'm listening to the phone, and

229
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me,

230
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) And I think to myself,

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
"Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!"

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And so I say to him -- clear in my mind, I say to him:

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
"This is Jill! I need help!"

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And what comes out of my voice is, "Woo woo woo woo woo."

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever."

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And a little while later, I am riding in an

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ambulance from one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air,

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
just, just right out of the balloon,

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I just felt my energy lift and just -- I felt my spirit surrender.

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And in that moment, I knew that I

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
was no longer the choreographer of my life.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
second chance at life, or this was perhaps

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
my moment of transition.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I said goodbye to my life.

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And my mind was now suspended between two very

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
opposite planes of reality. Stimulation coming in

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain.

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
voice out from the background noise,

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
position of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive,

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
like a genie just liberated from her bottle.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And my spirit soared free, like a great whale

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
gliding through the sea of silent euphoria.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking,

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body.

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive,

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and I have found Nirvana. And if I have

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
found Nirvana and I'm still alive, then everyone

270
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
who is alive can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate,

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
loving people who knew that they could come to

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
this space at any time. And that they could

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
purposely choose to step to the right of their

275
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
left hemispheres and find this peace. And then

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I realized what a tremendous gift this experience

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
could be, what a stroke of insight this could be

278
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover.

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers.

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Here I am with my mama,

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years to completely recover.

284
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So who are we? We are the life-force power of the universe,

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And we have the power to choose, moment by moment,

287
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
who and how we want to be in the world.

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Right here, right now, I can step into the

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am the life-force power of the universe.

291
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is.

293
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of

294
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual,

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
a solid. Separate from the flow,

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me.

298
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when?

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I believe that the more time we spend

300
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
project into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I thought that was an idea worth spreading.

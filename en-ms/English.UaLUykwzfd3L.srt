00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:10,630
CHAPTER I.

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,670
One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,010
bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:30,810
He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown,

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,879
arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow- like sections.

6
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,659
From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly

7
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,920
stay in place.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,370
His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his

9
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,629
circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

10
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,699
"What's happened to me," he thought.

11
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:06,280
It was no dream. His room, a proper room for a human being,

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,850
only somewhat too small, lay quietly between the four well-known walls.

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,030
Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread

14
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,369
out--Samsa was a travelling salesman--hung the picture which he had cut out of an

15
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,020
illustrated magazine a little while ago and set in a pretty gilt frame.

16
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,600
It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa.

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,570
She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff

18
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,429
into which her entire forearm had disappeared.

19
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:49,159
Gregor's glance then turned to the window.

20
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,249
The dreary weather--the rain drops were falling audibly down on the metal window

21
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:56,840
ledge--made him quite melancholy.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,119
"Why don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all this

23
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,329
foolishness," he thought.

24
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:12,370
But this was entirely impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and

25
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,250
in his present state he couldn't get himself into this position.

26
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,849
No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always rolled again onto

27
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,420
his back.

28
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,340
He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so that he would not have

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,430
to see the wriggling legs, and gave up only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,819
his side which he had never felt before.

31
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,640
"O God," he thought, "what a demanding job I've chosen!

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,819
Day in, day out, on the road.

33
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,140
The stresses of selling are much greater than the work going on at head office, and,

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,750
in addition to that, I have to cope with the problems of travelling, the worries

35
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,060
about train connections, irregular bad

36
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,510
food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships, which never come from

37
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,379
the heart. To hell with it all!"

38
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,430
He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen.

39
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,819
He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so that he could lift his

40
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,849
head more easily, found the itchy part, which was entirely covered with small white

41
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:35,180
spots--he did not know what to make of them and wanted to feel the place with a leg.

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,180
But he retracted it immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower all over

43
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,510
him.

44
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,579
He slid back again into his earlier position.

45
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:53,750
"This getting up early," he thought, "makes a man quite idiotic.

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,620
A man must have his sleep.

47
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,989
Other travelling salesmen live like harem women.

48
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,280
For instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,760
up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast.

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,239
If I were to try that with my boss, I'd be thrown out on the spot.

51
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,480
Still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good for me?

52
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,290
If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake, I'd have quit ages ago.

53
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,850
I would've gone to the boss and told him just what I think from the bottom of my

54
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,200
heart.

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,820
He would've fallen right off his desk! How weird it is to sit up at that desk and

56
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,250
talk down to the employee from way up there.

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,660
The boss has trouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him.

58
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,220
Anyway, I haven't completely given up that hope yet.

59
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,810
Once I've got together the money to pay off my parents' debt to him--that should take

60
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,860
another five or six years--I'll do it for sure.

61
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,820
Then I'll make the big break.

62
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,720
In any case, right now I have to get up. My train leaves at five o'clock."

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,570
He looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of drawers.

64
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,760
"Good God!" he thought.

65
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,580
It was half past six, and the hands were going quietly on.

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,510
It was past the half hour, already nearly quarter to.

67
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,190
Could the alarm have failed to ring?

68
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,690
One saw from the bed that it was properly set for four o'clock.

69
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,160
Certainly it had rung. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,220
that noise which made the furniture shake?

71
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:51,600
Now, it's true he'd not slept quietly, but evidently he'd slept all the more deeply.

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,980
Still, what should he do now? The next train left at seven o'clock.

73
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,940
To catch that one, he would have to go in a mad rush.

74
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,800
The sample collection wasn't packed up yet, and he really didn't feel particularly

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,910
fresh and active.

76
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:13,120
And even if he caught the train, there was no avoiding a blow-up with the boss,

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,230
because the firm's errand boy would've waited for the five o'clock train and

78
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,020
reported the news of his absence long ago.

79
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,880
He was the boss's minion, without backbone or intelligence.

80
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,860
Well then, what if he reported in sick?

81
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,410
But that would be extremely embarrassing and suspicious, because during his five

82
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,450
years' service Gregor hadn't been sick even once.

83
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,910
The boss would certainly come with the doctor from the health insurance company

84
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,850
and would reproach his parents for their lazy son and cut short all objections with

85
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,730
the insurance doctor's comments; for him

86
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,210
everyone was completely healthy but really lazy about work.

87
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,110
And besides, would the doctor in this case be totally wrong?

88
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,950
Apart from a really excessive drowsiness after the long sleep, Gregor in fact felt

89
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,660
quite well and even had a really strong appetite.

90
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,360
As he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, without being able to make

91
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,060
the decision to get out of bed--the alarm clock was indicating exactly quarter to

92
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,990
seven--there was a cautious knock on the door by the head of the bed.

93
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,400
"Gregor," a voice called--it was his mother!--"it's quarter to seven.

94
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,030
Don't you want to be on your way?"

95
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,040
The soft voice! Gregor was startled when he heard his voice

96
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,380
answering.

97
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:56,090
It was clearly and unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as if

98
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,870
from below, an irrepressibly painful squeaking, which left the words positively

99
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,260
distinct only in the first moment and

100
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,750
distorted them in the reverberation, so that one didn't know if one had heard

101
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,630
correctly.

102
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,320
Gregor wanted to answer in detail and explain everything, but in these

103
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,530
circumstances he confined himself to saying, "Yes, yes, thank you mother.

104
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,390
I'm getting up right away."

105
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,250
Because of the wooden door the change in Gregor's voice was not really noticeable

106
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,500
outside, so his mother calmed down with this explanation and shuffled off.

107
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,720
However, as a result of the short conversation, the other family members

108
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,459
became aware that Gregor was unexpectedly still at home, and already his father was

109
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,279
knocking on one side door, weakly but with his fist.

110
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,439
"Gregor, Gregor," he called out, "what's going on?"

111
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:04,410
And, after a short while, he urged him on again in a deeper voice: "Gregor!"

112
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,279
Gregor!" At the other side door, however, his sister

113
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,959
knocked lightly.

114
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,329
"Gregor? Are you all right?

115
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:18,649
Do you need anything?" Gregor directed answers in both directions,

116
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,259
"I'll be ready right away."

117
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:27,199
He made an effort with the most careful articulation and by inserting long pauses

118
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:34,790
between the individual words to remove everything remarkable from his voice.

119
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,560
His father turned back to his breakfast.

120
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:44,600
However, the sister whispered, "Gregor, open the door--I beg you."

121
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,160
Gregor had no intention of opening the door, but congratulated himself on his

122
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,829
precaution, acquired from travelling, of locking all doors during the night, even at

123
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,110
home.

124
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:04,540
First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed, above all have

125
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:12,639
breakfast, and only then consider further action, for--he noticed this clearly--by

126
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,470
thinking things over in bed he would not reach a reasonable conclusion.

127
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,749
He remembered that he had already often felt a light pain or other in bed, perhaps

128
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:29,589
the result of an awkward lying position, which later turned out to be purely

129
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,310
imaginary when he stood up, and he was

130
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,199
eager to see how his present fantasies would gradually dissipate.

131
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:43,310
That the change in his voice was nothing other than the onset of a real chill, an

132
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,069
occupational illness of commercial travellers, of that he had not the

133
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,870
slightest doubt.

134
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,899
It was very easy to throw aside the blanket.

135
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,269
He needed only to push himself up a little, and it fell by itself.

136
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,439
But to continue was difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide.

137
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:11,240
He needed arms and hands to push himself upright.

138
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,329
Instead of these, however, he had only many small limbs which were incessantly moving

139
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:26,050
with very different motions and which, in addition, he was unable to control.

140
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,569
If he wanted to bend one of them, then it was the first to extend itself, and if he

141
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:39,209
finally succeeded doing what he wanted with this limb, in the meantime all the others,

142
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,050
as if left free, moved around in an excessively painful agitation.

143
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,470
"But I must not stay in bed uselessly," said Gregor to himself.

144
00:11:51,470 --> 00:12:00,829
At first he wanted to get out of bed with the lower part of his body, but this lower

145
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:05,439
part--which, by the way, he had not yet looked at and which he also couldn't

146
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:09,829
picture clearly--proved itself too difficult to move.

147
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:14,680
The attempt went so slowly.

148
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,540
When, having become almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his

149
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,339
force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower

150
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,399
bedpost hard.

151
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,350
The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower part of his body was at the

152
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,160
moment probably the most sensitive.

153
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:45,240
Thus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first and turned his head carefully

154
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,660
toward the edge of the bed.

155
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,040
He managed to do this easily, and in spite of its width and weight his body mass at

156
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,430
last slowly followed the turning of his head.

157
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,240
But as he finally raised his head outside the bed in the open air, he became anxious

158
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,100
about moving forward any further in this manner, for if he allowed himself

159
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,870
eventually to fall by this process, it

160
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,889
would take a miracle to prevent his head from getting injured.

161
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:20,930
And at all costs he must not lose consciousness right now.

162
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,069
He preferred to remain in bed.

163
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:31,209
However, after a similar effort, while he lay there again, sighing as before, and

164
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:38,249
once again saw his small limbs fighting one another, if anything worse than earlier,

165
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,329
and didn't see any chance of imposing quiet

166
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:46,749
and order on this arbitrary movement, he told himself again that he couldn't

167
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:52,529
possibly remain in bed and that it might be the most reasonable thing to sacrifice

168
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:55,170
everything if there was even the slightest

169
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,379
hope of getting himself out of bed in the process.

170
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:05,720
At the same moment, however, he didn't forget to remind himself from time to time

171
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,430
of the fact that calm--indeed the calmest-- reflection might be better than the most

172
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,720
confused decisions.

173
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,459
At such moments, he directed his gaze as precisely as he could toward the window,

174
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,980
but unfortunately there was little confident cheer to be had from a glance at

175
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,069
the morning mist, which concealed even the other side of the narrow street.

176
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:40,430
"It's already seven o'clock," he told himself at the latest striking of the alarm

177
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,329
clock, "already seven o'clock and still such a fog."

178
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:52,110
And for a little while longer he lay quietly with weak breathing, as if perhaps

179
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,439
waiting for normal and natural conditions to re-emerge out of the complete stillness.

180
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:06,110
But then he said to himself, "Before it strikes a quarter past seven, whatever

181
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,369
happens I must be completely out of bed.

182
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:14,809
Besides, by then someone from the office will arrive to inquire about me, because

183
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:18,779
the office will open before seven o'clock."

184
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,809
And he made an effort then to rock his entire body length out of the bed with a

185
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,600
uniform motion.

186
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,119
If he let himself fall out of the bed in this way, his head, which in the course of

187
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:38,519
the fall he intended to lift up sharply, would probably remain uninjured.

188
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,939
His back seemed to be hard; nothing would really happen to that as a result of the

189
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:45,899
fall.

190
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,749
His greatest reservation was a worry about the loud noise which the fall must create

191
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:58,029
and which presumably would arouse, if not fright, then at least concern on the other

192
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,569
side of all the doors.

193
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,420
However, it had to be tried.

194
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,899
As Gregor was in the process of lifting himself half out of bed--the new method was

195
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:16,550
more of a game than an effort; he needed only to rock with a constant rhythm--it

196
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:22,059
struck him how easy all this would be if someone were to come to his aid.

197
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:27,959
Two strong people--he thought of his father and the servant girl--would have been quite

198
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,309
sufficient.

199
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:34,420
They would have only had to push their arms under his arched back to get him out of the

200
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,990
bed, to bend down with their load, and then merely to exercise patience and care that

201
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,449
he completed the flip onto the floor, where

202
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:50,040
his diminutive legs would then, he hoped, acquire a purpose.

203
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,420
Now, quite apart from the fact that the doors were locked, should he really call

204
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,399
out for help?

205
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:04,890
In spite of all his distress, he was unable to suppress a smile at this idea.

206
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,209
He had already got to the point where, by rocking more strongly, he maintained his

207
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,839
equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he would finally have to decide, for in

208
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,010
five minutes it would be a quarter past seven.

209
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,870
Then there was a ring at the door of the apartment.

210
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,720
"That's someone from the office," he told himself, and he almost froze while his

211
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,760
small limbs only danced around all the faster.

212
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,780
For one moment everything remained still.

213
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,020
"They aren't opening," Gregor said to himself, caught up in some absurd hope.

214
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:49,890
But of course then, as usual, the servant girl with her firm tread went to the door

215
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,190
and opened it.

216
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,900
Gregor needed to hear only the first word of the visitor's greeting to recognize

217
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,070
immediately who it was, the manager himself.

218
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:08,020
Why was Gregor the only one condemned to work in a firm where, at the slightest

219
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,280
lapse, someone immediately attracted the greatest suspicion?

220
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,590
Were all the employees then collectively, one and all, scoundrels?

221
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,980
Among them was there then no truly devoted person who, if he failed to use just a

222
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,990
couple of hours in the morning for office work, would become abnormal from pangs of

223
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,010
conscience and really be in no state to get out of bed?

224
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,400
Was it really not enough to let an apprentice make inquiries, if such

225
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,010
questioning was even necessary?

226
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,770
Must the manager himself come, and in the process must it be demonstrated to the

227
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,340
entire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious

228
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,190
circumstance could be entrusted only to the intelligence of the manager?

229
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,760
And more as a consequence of the excited state in which this idea put Gregor than as

230
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,370
a result of an actual decision, he swung himself with all his might out of the bed.

231
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,540
There was a loud thud, but not a real crash.

232
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,870
The fall was absorbed somewhat by the carpet and, in addition, his back was more

233
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,400
elastic than Gregor had thought.

234
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,750
For that reason the dull noise was not quite so conspicuous.

235
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,060
But he had not held his head up with sufficient care and had hit it.

236
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:43,180
He turned his head, irritated and in pain, and rubbed it on the carpet.

237
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,950
"Something has fallen in there," said the manager in the next room on the left.

238
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,200
Gregor tried to imagine to himself whether anything similar to what was happening to

239
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,410
him today could have also happened at some point to the manager.

240
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,870
At least one had to concede the possibility of such a thing.

241
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,010
However, as if to give a rough answer to this question, the manager now, with a

242
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:15,310
squeak of his polished boots, took a few determined steps in the next room.

243
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,960
From the neighbouring room on the right the sister was whispering to inform Gregor:

244
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,680
"Gregor, the manager is here." "I know," said Gregor to himself.

245
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,820
But he did not dare make his voice loud enough so that his sister could hear.

246
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,110
"Gregor," his father now said from the neighbouring room on the left, "Mr. Manager

247
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,590
has come and is asking why you have not left on the early train.

248
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,530
We don't know what we should tell him.

249
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,880
Besides, he also wants to speak to you personally.

250
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,010
So please open the door. He will be good enough to forgive the mess

251
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,320
in your room."

252
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,900
In the middle of all this, the manager called out in a friendly way, "Good

253
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,010
morning, Mr. Samsa."

254
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:08,280
"He is not well," said his mother to the manager, while his father was still talking

255
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,590
at the door, "He is not well, believe me, Mr. Manager.

256
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,150
Otherwise how would Gregor miss a train?

257
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,680
The young man has nothing in his head except business.

258
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm almost angry that he never goes out at night.

259
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,050
Right now he's been in the city eight days, but he's been at home every evening.

260
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:35,380
He sits here with us at the table and reads the newspaper quietly or studies his travel

261
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,770
schedules.

262
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,860
It's a quite a diversion for him to busy himself with fretwork.

263
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,870
For instance, he cut out a small frame over the course of two or three evenings.

264
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,250
You'd be amazed how pretty it is.

265
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,470
It's hanging right inside the room. You'll see it immediately, as soon as

266
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,950
Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I'm happy that you're here, Mr.

267
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,550
Manager.

268
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,780
By ourselves, we would never have made Gregor open the door.

269
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,940
He's so stubborn, and he's certainly not well, although he denied that this

270
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,970
morning."

271
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:17,990
"I'm coming right away," said Gregor slowly and deliberately and didn't move, so as not

272
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,130
to lose one word of the conversation.

273
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,960
"My dear lady, I cannot explain it to myself in any other way," said the manager;

274
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,170
"I hope it is nothing serious.

275
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,860
On the other hand, I must also say that we business people, luckily or unluckily,

276
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,350
however one looks at it, very often simply have to overcome a slight indisposition for

277
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,540
business reasons."

278
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,910
"So can Mr. Manager come in to see you now?" asked his father impatiently and

279
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,880
knocked once again on the door. "No," said Gregor.

280
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,030
In the neighbouring room on the left a painful stillness descended.

281
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:05,510
In the neighbouring room on the right the sister began to sob.

282
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,810
Why didn't his sister go to the others?

283
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,470
She'd probably just gotten up out of bed now and hadn't even started to get dressed

284
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,710
yet. Then why was she crying?

285
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,900
Because he wasn't getting up and wasn't letting the manager in, because he was in

286
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,710
danger of losing his position, and because then his boss would badger his parents once

287
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,720
again with the old demands?

288
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,650
Those were probably unnecessary worries right now.

289
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,990
Gregor was still here and wasn't thinking at all about abandoning his family.

290
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,390
At the moment he was lying right there on the carpet, and no one who knew about his

291
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,230
condition would've seriously demanded that he let the manager in.

292
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,750
But Gregor wouldn't be casually dismissed right way because of this small

293
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,470
discourtesy, for which he would find an easy and suitable excuse later on.

294
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,390
It seemed to Gregor that it might be far more reasonable to leave him in peace at

295
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,340
the moment, instead of disturbing him with crying and conversation.

296
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,710
But it was the very uncertainty which distressed the others and excused their

297
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:25,120
behaviour. "Mr. Samsa," the manager was now shouting,

298
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,300
his voice raised, "what's the matter?

299
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,320
You are barricading yourself in your room, answer with only a yes and a no, are making

300
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,890
serious and unnecessary troubles for your parents, and neglecting (I mention this

301
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:46,680
only incidentally) your commercial duties in a truly unheard of manner.

302
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,990
I am speaking here in the name of your parents and your employer, and I am

303
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,860
requesting you in all seriousness for an immediate and clear explanation.

304
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,910
I am amazed.

305
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:05,340
I am amazed. I thought I knew you as a calm, reasonable

306
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,830
person, and now you appear suddenly to want to start parading around in weird moods.

307
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:18,500
The Chief indicated to me earlier this very day a possible explanation for your

308
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,820
neglect--it concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a short while ago--

309
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,580
but in truth I almost gave him my word of

310
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,530
honour that this explanation could not be correct.

311
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:36,930
However, now I see here your unimaginable pig headedness, and I am totally losing any

312
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,680
desire to speak up for you in the slightest.

313
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,470
And your position is not at all the most secure.

314
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,710
Originally I intended to mention all this to you privately, but since you are letting

315
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,430
me waste my time here uselessly, I don't know why the matter shouldn't come to the

316
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,700
attention of your parents.

317
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:01,170
Your productivity has also been very unsatisfactory recently.

318
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,080
Of course, it's not the time of year to conduct exceptional business, we recognize

319
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,170
that, but a time of year for conducting no business, there is no such thing at all,

320
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,790
Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be."

321
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:22,620
"But Mr. Manager," called Gregor, beside himself and, in his agitation, forgetting

322
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,880
everything else, "I'm opening the door immediately, this very moment.

323
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,920
A slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, has prevented me from getting up.

324
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,990
I'm still lying in bed right now. But I'm quite refreshed once again.

325
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,410
I'm in the midst of getting out of bed.

326
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,560
Just have patience for a short moment! Things are not going as well as I thought.

327
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,000
But things are all right. How suddenly this can overcome someone!

328
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,660
Only yesterday evening everything was fine with me.

329
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,830
My parents certainly know that. Actually just yesterday evening I had a

330
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,540
small premonition.

331
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:06,710
People must have seen that in me. Why have I not reported that to the office?

332
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,290
But people always think that they'll get over sickness without having to stay at

333
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,480
home.

334
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,150
Mr. Manager! Take it easy on my parents!

335
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,930
There is really no basis for the criticisms which you're now making against me, and

336
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,510
really nobody has said a word to me about that.

337
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,440
Perhaps you have not read the latest orders which I shipped.

338
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,850
Besides, now I'm setting out on my trip on the eight o'clock train; the few hours'

339
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,160
rest have made me stronger.

340
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,000
Mr. Manager, do not stay. I will be at the office in person right

341
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,290
away. Please have the goodness to say that and to

342
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,180
convey my respects to the Chief."

343
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,690
While Gregor was quickly blurting all this out, hardly aware of what he was saying, he

344
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,030
had moved close to the chest of drawers without effort, probably as a result of the

345
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,860
practice he had already had in bed, and now

346
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:10,220
he was trying to raise himself up on it. Actually, he wanted to open the door.

347
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,270
He really wanted to let himself be seen by and to speak with the manager.

348
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:21,460
He was keen to witness what the others now asking about him would say when they saw

349
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,400
him. If they were startled, then Gregor had no

350
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,690
more responsibility and could be calm.

351
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:35,270
But if they accepted everything quietly, then he would have no reason to get excited

352
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,380
and, if he got a move on, could really be at the station around eight o'clock.

353
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,780
At first he slid down a few times on the smooth chest of drawers.

354
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,480
But at last he gave himself a final swing and stood upright there.

355
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,840
He was no longer at all aware of the pains in his lower body, no matter how they might

356
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,140
still sting.

357
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,120
Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair, on the edge of which he

358
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,300
braced himself with his thin limbs.

359
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,080
By doing this he gained control over himself and kept quiet, for he could now

360
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,650
hear the manager.

361
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:22,950
"Did you understood a single word?" the manager asked the parents, "Is he playing

362
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,920
the fool with us?"

363
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,020
"For God's sake," cried the mother already in tears, "perhaps he's very ill and we're

364
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,960
upsetting him. Grete!

365
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,940
Grete!" she yelled at that point.

366
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,320
"Mother?" called the sister from the other side.

367
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,250
They were making themselves understood through Gregor's room.

368
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,270
"You must go to the doctor right away.

369
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,830
Gregor is sick. Hurry to the doctor.

370
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,530
Have you heard Gregor speak yet?"

371
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:56,500
"That was an animal's voice," said the manager, remarkably quietly in comparison

372
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,340
to the mother's cries. "Anna!

373
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,120
Anna!' yelled the father through the hall into the kitchen, clapping his hands,

374
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,860
"fetch a locksmith right away!"

375
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,970
The two young women were already running through the hall with swishing skirts--how

376
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,250
had his sister dressed herself so quickly?- -and yanked open the doors of the

377
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,520
apartment.

378
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,150
One couldn't hear the doors closing at all. They probably had left them open, as is

379
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,530
customary in an apartment where a huge misfortune has taken place.

380
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,360
However, Gregor had become much calmer.

381
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,540
All right, people did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear

382
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,450
enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because his ears had gotten used to

383
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,450
them.

384
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,190
But at least people now thought that things were not all right with him and were

385
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,430
prepared to help him.

386
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,700
The confidence and assurance with which the first arrangements had been carried out

387
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,630
made him feel good.

388
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:05,070
He felt himself included once again in the circle of humanity and was expecting from

389
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,740
both the doctor and the locksmith, without differentiating between them with any real

390
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,530
precision, splendid and surprising results.

391
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,630
In order to get as clear a voice as possible for the critical conversation

392
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,890
which was imminent, he coughed a little, and certainly took the trouble to do this

393
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,950
in a really subdued way, since it was

394
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:35,220
possible that even this noise sounded like something different from a human cough.

395
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,450
He no longer trusted himself to decide any more.

396
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,230
Meanwhile in the next room it had become really quiet.

397
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,460
Perhaps his parents were sitting with the manager at the table whispering; perhaps

398
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,940
they were all leaning against the door listening.

399
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,080
Gregor pushed himself slowly towards the door, with the help of the easy chair, let

400
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,900
go of it there, threw himself against the door, held himself upright against it--the

401
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,200
balls of his tiny limbs had a little sticky

402
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,870
stuff on them--and rested there momentarily from his exertion.

403
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:20,100
Then he made an effort to turn the key in the lock with his mouth.

404
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,690
Unfortunately it seemed that he had no real teeth.

405
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,070
How then was he to grab hold of the key?

406
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:34,070
But to make up for that his jaws were naturally very strong; with their help he

407
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,160
managed to get the key really moving.

408
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,150
He didn't notice that he was obviously inflicting some damage on himself, for a

409
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:50,560
brown fluid came out of his mouth, flowed over the key, and dripped onto the floor.

410
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,230
"Just listen for a moment," said the manager in the next room; "he's turning the

411
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,530
key." For Gregor that was a great encouragement.

412
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,970
But they all should've called out to him, including his father and mother, "Come on,

413
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:10,100
Gregor," they should've shouted; "keep going, keep working on the lock."

414
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,150
Imagining that all his efforts were being followed with suspense, he bit down

415
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,720
frantically on the key with all the force he could muster.

416
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,190
As the key turned more, he danced around the lock.

417
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:30,380
Now he was holding himself upright only with his mouth, and he had to hang onto the

418
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,060
key or then press it down again with the whole weight of his body, as necessary.

419
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:43,370
The quite distinct click of the lock as it finally snapped really woke Gregor up.

420
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:50,190
Breathing heavily he said to himself, "So I didn't need the locksmith," and he set his

421
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,870
head against the door handle to open the door completely.

422
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,650
Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already open very wide without

423
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,310
him yet being really visible.

424
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,950
He first had to turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, very carefully, of

425
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,849
course, if he didn't want to fall awkwardly on his back right at the entrance into the

426
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:16,240
room.

427
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,369
He was still preoccupied with this difficult movement and had no time to pay

428
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:26,609
attention to anything else, when he heard the manager exclaim a loud "Oh!"--it

429
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:30,269
sounded like the wind whistling--and now he

430
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:35,990
saw him, nearest to the door, pressing his hand against his open mouth and moving

431
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:42,329
slowly back, as if an invisible constant force was pushing him away.

432
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:48,480
His mother--in spite of the presence of the manager she was standing here with her hair

433
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,409
sticking up on end, still a mess from the night--was looking at his father with her

434
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,609
hands clasped.

435
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:01,049
She then went two steps towards Gregor and collapsed right in the middle of her

436
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:06,960
skirts, which were spread out all around her, her face sunk on her breast,

437
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,329
completely concealed.

438
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:15,640
His father clenched his fist with a hostile expression, as if he wished to push Gregor

439
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,150
back into his room, then looked uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes

440
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:27,990
with his hands, and cried so that his mighty breast shook.

441
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:33,999
At this point Gregor did not take one step into the room, but leaned his body from the

442
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:40,680
inside against the firmly bolted wing of the door, so that only half his body was

443
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,470
visible, as well as his head, tilted

444
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,109
sideways, with which he peeped over at the others.

445
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:50,880
Meanwhile it had become much brighter.

446
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Standing out clearly from the other side of the street was a part of the endless grey-

447
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,190
black house situated opposite--it was a hospital--with its severe regular windows

448
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,480
breaking up the facade.

449
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:12,799
The rain was still coming down, but only in large individual drops visibly and firmly

450
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:17,749
thrown down one by one onto the ground.

451
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:23,240
The breakfast dishes were standing piled around on the table, because for his father

452
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,910
breakfast was the most important meal time in the day, which he prolonged for hours by

453
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,650
reading various newspapers.

454
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,680
Directly across on the opposite wall hung a photograph of Gregor from the time of his

455
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,950
military service; it was a picture of him as a lieutenant, as he, smiling and worry

456
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:51,920
free, with his hand on his sword, demanded respect for his bearing and uniform.

457
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,410
The door to the hall was ajar, and since the door to the apartment was also open,

458
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,809
one could see out into the landing of the apartment and the start of the staircase

459
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:05,440
going down.

460
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,579
"Now," said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one who had kept his composure.

461
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:17,730
"I'll get dressed right away, pack up the collection of samples, and set off.

462
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,890
You'll allow me to set out on my way, will you not?

463
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:26,599
You see, Mr. Manager, I am not pig-headed, and I am happy to work.

464
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,859
Travelling is exhausting, but I couldn't live without it.

465
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:33,480
Where are you going, Mr. Manager? To the office?

466
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,220
Really?

467
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,140
Will you report everything truthfully?

468
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:42,779
A person can be incapable of work momentarily, but that's precisely the best

469
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:48,329
time to remember the earlier achievements and to consider that later, after the

470
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,109
obstacles have been shoved aside, the

471
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:54,299
person will work all the more eagerly and intensely.

472
00:37:54,299 --> 00:38:00,359
I am really so indebted to Mr. Chief--you know that perfectly well.

473
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:05,079
On the other hand, I am concerned about my parents and my sister.

474
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,309
I'm in a fix, but I'll work myself out of it again.

475
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:13,640
Don't make things more difficult for me than they already are.

476
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,999
Speak up on my behalf in the office! People don't like travelling salesmen.

477
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,519
I know that.

478
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,240
People think they earn pots of money and thus lead a fine life.

479
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,680
People don't even have any special reason to think through this judgment more

480
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,130
clearly.

481
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:35,819
But you, Mr. Manager, you have a better perspective on what's involved than other

482
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,970
people, even, I tell you in total confidence, a better perspective than Mr.

483
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,900
Chairman himself, who in his capacity as

484
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,690
the employer may let his judgment make casual mistakes at the expense of an

485
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,049
employee.

486
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:55,049
You also know well enough that the travelling salesman who is outside the

487
00:38:55,049 --> 00:39:02,809
office almost the entire year can become so easily a victim of gossip, coincidences,

488
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,579
and groundless complaints, against which

489
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:10,660
it's impossible for him to defend himself, since for the most part he doesn't hear

490
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,990
about them at all and only then when he's exhausted after finishing a trip and at

491
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,150
home gets to feel in his own body the nasty

492
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,890
consequences, which can't be thoroughly explored back to their origins.

493
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:30,900
Mr. Manager, don't leave without speaking a word telling me that you'll at least

494
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,049
concede that I'm a little in the right!"

495
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:41,400
But at Gregor's first words the manager had already turned away, and now he looked back

496
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,680
at Gregor over his twitching shoulders with pursed lips.

497
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,819
During Gregor's speech he was not still for a moment but kept moving away towards the

498
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:58,680
door, without taking his eyes off Gregor, but really gradually, as if there was a

499
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,749
secret ban on leaving the room.

500
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:06,680
He was already in the hall, and given the sudden movement with which he finally

501
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,049
pulled his foot out of the living room, one could have believed that he had just burned

502
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:13,359
the sole of his foot.

503
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,660
In the hall, however, he stretched his right hand out away from his body towards

504
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,140
the staircase, as if some truly supernatural relief was waiting for him

505
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,079
there.

506
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:33,759
Gregor realized that he must not under any circumstances allow the manager to go away

507
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:39,150
in this frame of mind, especially if his position in the firm was not to be placed

508
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,789
in the greatest danger.

509
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:44,690
His parents did not understand all this very well.

510
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:50,359
Over the long years, they had developed the conviction that Gregor was set up for life

511
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,200
in his firm and, in addition, they had so much to do nowadays with their present

512
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,249
troubles that all foresight was foreign to them.

513
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:06,019
But Gregor had this foresight. The manager must be held back, calmed down,

514
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:09,390
convinced, and finally won over.

515
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,630
The future of Gregor and his family really depended on it!

516
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,430
If only the sister had been there! She was clever.

517
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,509
She had already cried while Gregor was still lying quietly on his back.

518
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:27,989
And the manager, this friend of the ladies, would certainly let himself be guided by

519
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:29,009
her.

520
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:33,880
She would have closed the door to the apartment and talked him out of his fright

521
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,099
in the hall. But the sister was not even there.

522
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,509
Gregor must deal with it himself.

523
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:48,170
Without thinking that as yet he didn't know anything about his present ability to move

524
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:54,039
and that his speech possibly--indeed probably--had once again not been

525
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,700
understood, he left the wing of the door,

526
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,680
pushed himself through the opening, and wanted to go over to the manager, who was

527
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,599
already holding tight onto the handrail with both hands on the landing in a

528
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,329
ridiculous way.

529
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:14,150
But as he looked for something to hold onto, with a small scream Gregor

530
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,650
immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs.

531
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:23,099
Scarcely had this happened, when he felt for the first time that morning a general

532
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,450
physical well being.

533
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:32,259
The small limbs had firm floor under them; they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed to his

534
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:37,710
joy, and strove to carry him forward in the direction he wanted.

535
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:43,069
Right away he believed that the final amelioration of all his suffering was

536
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:44,349
immediately at hand.

537
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:51,329
But at the very moment when he lay on the floor rocking in a restrained manner quite

538
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:56,599
close and directly across from his mother, who had apparently totally sunk into

539
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,869
herself, she suddenly sprang right up with

540
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:06,819
her arms spread far apart and her fingers extended and cried out, "Help, for God's

541
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:08,839
sake, help!"

542
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:14,460
She held her head bowed down, as if she wanted to view Gregor better, but ran

543
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,720
senselessly back, contradicting that gesture, forgetting that behind her stood

544
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,109
the table with all the dishes on it.

545
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:27,839
When she reached the table, she sat down heavily on it, as if absent-mindedly, and

546
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,369
did not appear to notice at all that next to her coffee was pouring out onto the

547
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:37,980
carpet in a full stream from the large overturned container.

548
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:45,579
"Mother, mother," said Gregor quietly, and looked over towards her.

549
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:49,970
The manager momentarily had disappeared completely from his mind.

550
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:56,420
At the sight of the flowing coffee Gregor couldn't stop himself snapping his jaws in

551
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,660
the air a few times .

552
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:05,369
At that his mother screamed all over again, hurried from the table, and collapsed into

553
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:09,539
the arms of his father, who was rushing towards her.

554
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,619
But Gregor had no time right now for his parents--the manager was already on the

555
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:18,920
staircase. His chin level with the banister, the

556
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,259
manager looked back for the last time.

557
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,039
Gregor took an initial movement to catch up to him if possible.

558
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,730
But the manager must have suspected something, because he made a leap down over

559
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,319
a few stairs and disappeared, still shouting "Huh!"

560
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,440
The sound echoed throughout the entire stairwell.

561
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,130
Now, unfortunately this flight of the manager also seemed to bewilder his father

562
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:46,789
completely.

563
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:52,420
Earlier he had been relatively calm, for instead of running after the manager

564
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,069
himself or at least not hindering Gregor from his pursuit, with his right hand he

565
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,960
grabbed hold of the manager's cane, which

566
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,079
he had left behind with his hat and overcoat on a chair.

567
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,599
With his left hand, his father picked up a large newspaper from the table and,

568
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,619
stamping his feet on the floor, he set out to drive Gregor back into his room by

569
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,829
waving the cane and the newspaper.

570
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:25,079
No request of Gregor's was of any use; no request would even be understood.

571
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:30,739
No matter how willing he was to turn his head respectfully, his father just stomped

572
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:33,880
all the harder with his feet.

573
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,730
Across the room from him his mother had pulled open a window, in spite of the cool

574
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,980
weather, and leaning out with her hands on her cheeks, she pushed her face far outside

575
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,920
the window.

576
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,749
Between the alley and the stairwell a strong draught came up, the curtains on the

577
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:57,829
window flew around, the newspapers on the table swished, and individual sheets

578
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,460
fluttered down over the floor.

579
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:07,420
The father relentlessly pressed forward, pushing out sibilants, like a wild man.

580
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,970
Now, Gregor had no practice at all in going backwards--it was really very slow going.

581
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,339
If Gregor only had been allowed to turn himself around, he would have been in his

582
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:23,710
room right away, but he was afraid to make his father impatient by the time-consuming

583
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,920
process of turning around, and each moment

584
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,460
he faced the threat of a mortal blow on his back or his head from the cane in his

585
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,039
father's hand.

586
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:39,819
Finally Gregor had no other option, for he noticed with horror that he did not

587
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:44,970
understand yet how to maintain his direction going backwards.

588
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:51,799
And so he began, amid constantly anxious sideways glances in his father's direction,

589
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:57,029
to turn himself around as quickly as possible, although in truth this was only

590
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:57,809
done very slowly.

591
00:46:57,809 --> 00:47:04,359
Perhaps his father noticed his good intentions, for he did not disrupt Gregor

592
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:09,970
in this motion, but with the tip of the cane from a distance he even directed

593
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,650
Gregor's rotating movement here and there.

594
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:18,809
If only his father had not hissed so unbearably!

595
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:23,119
Because of that Gregor totally lost his head.

596
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,349
He was already almost totally turned around, when, always with this hissing in

597
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:33,609
his ear, he just made a mistake and turned himself back a little.

598
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:38,239
But when he finally was successful in getting his head in front of the door

599
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,729
opening, it became clear that his body was too wide to go through any further.

600
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:50,839
Naturally his father, in his present mental state, had no idea of opening the other

601
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:56,229
wing of the door a bit to create a suitable passage for Gregor to get through.

602
00:47:56,229 --> 00:48:02,069
His single fixed thought was that Gregor must get into his room as quickly as

603
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:02,869
possible.

604
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:08,160
He would never have allowed the elaborate preparations that Gregor required to orient

605
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,779
himself and thus perhaps get through the door.

606
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:16,950
On the contrary, as if there were no obstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now

607
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,749
drove Gregor forwards.

608
00:48:19,749 --> 00:48:24,729
Behind Gregor the sound at this point was no longer like the voice of only a single

609
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:25,819
father.

610
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:31,599
Now it was really no longer a joke, and Gregor forced himself, come what might,

611
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,289
into the door. One side of his body was lifted up.

612
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:39,089
He lay at an angle in the door opening.

613
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:46,829
His one flank was sore with the scraping. On the white door ugly blotches were left.

614
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:52,529
Soon he was stuck fast and would have not been able to move any more on his own.

615
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:58,710
The tiny legs on one side hung twitching in the air above, and the ones on the other

616
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,630
side were pushed painfully into the floor.

617
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:08,369
Then his father gave him one really strong liberating push from behind, and he

618
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:14,339
scurried, bleeding severely, far into the interior of his room.

619
00:49:14,339 --> 99:59:59,999
The door was slammed shut with the cane, and finally it was quiet.

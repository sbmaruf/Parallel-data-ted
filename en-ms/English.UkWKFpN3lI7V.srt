1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
I have this problem here from
chapter five of the Kotz,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,660
Treichel, and Townsend Chemistry
and Chemical

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,560
Reactivity book, and I'm doing
this with their permission.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,990
So they tell us that ethanol,
C2H5OH, boils at-- let me do

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,930
this in orange-- it boils at
78.29 degrees Celsius.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,860
How much energy, in joules,
is required to raise the

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,920
temperature of 1 kilogram of
ethanol from 20 degrees

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,390
Celsius to the boiling point and
then change the liquid to

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,850
vapor at that temperature?

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,440
So there's really two parts
of this problem.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,290
How much energy, in joules, to
take the ethanol from 20

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,340
degrees to 78.29 degrees
Celsius?

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,510
That's the first part.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,310
And then once we're there,
we're going to have 78.29

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,100
degrees Celsius liquid
ethanol.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,730
But then we also need the energy
to turn it into vapor.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,150
So those are going to
be the two parts.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,010
So let's just think about
just raising the liquid

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,260
temperature.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,680
Raising, Raising the liquid temperature

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,220
Let's figure out how we're
going to do that.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,150
Just the liquid temperature.

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,850
So the first thing I looked at
is well how many degrees are

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,970
we raising the temperature?

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:27,110
Well we're going from 20 degrees
Celsius-- let me write

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,560
Celsius there just so it's
clear-- 20 degrees Celsius to

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,120
78.29 degrees Celsius.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,250
So how much did we raise it?

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,040
Well, 78.29 minus 20 is 58.29.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:55,910
So our change in temperature
is equal to 58.29 degrees

31
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:02,050
Celsius or this could even
be 58.29 kelvin.

32
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,400
And the reason why we can do
that is because differences on

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,800
the Celsius scale and
the kelvin scale

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
are the same thing.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,180
The kelvin scale is just
a shifted version

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,030
of the Celsius scale.

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,840
If you added 273 to each of
these numbers you would have

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,270
the kelvin temperature, but
then if you take the

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,990
difference, it's going to be
the exact same difference.

40
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,240
Either way you do it,
78.29 minus 20.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,120
So that's how much we have
to raise the temperature.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,450
So let's figure out how much
energy is required to raise

43
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,420
that temperature.

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,340
So we want a delta T.

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,720
We want to raise the
temperature 58.29.

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,190
I'll stay in Celsius.

47
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,400
Actually let me just change it
to kelvin because that looks

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,490
like what our units are given
in terms of specific heat.

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,390
So let me write that down.

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,690
58.29 kelvin is our change
in temperature.

51
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,060
I could have converted either of
these to kelvin first, then

52
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,510
found the difference, and gotten
the exact same number.

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,470
Because the Celsius scale and
the kelvin scale, the

54
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,820
increments are the
same amount.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,600
Now, that's our change
in temperature.

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,820
Now how much ethanol are
we trying to boil?

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,420
Well, it tells us
right over here.

58
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,030
It tells us that we're dealing
with 1 kilogram of ethanol.

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,460
And everything else they give us
is in grams. So let me just

60
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,190
write that 1 kilogram, that's
the same thing as 1,000 grams.

61
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,940
We could just write it here.

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,050
1.00 kilogram is equal to-- or
let me write it this way--

63
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,760
times 1,000 grams
per 1 kilogram.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,710
These cancel out.

65
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,950
This is the same thing as 1,000
grams. Although the

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,270
reality is we only have three
significant digits-- this

67
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,260
makes it look like
we have four.

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,780
So we have 1,000 grams times
1,000 grams. And then we just

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,030
multiply this times the specific
heat of ethanol.

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,410
The specific heat capacity of
ethanol right here, 2.44

71
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,720
joules per gram kelvin.

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,920
So times 2.44 joules.

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:11,460
Let me write it this way, 2.44
joules per gram kelvin.

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,990
You see that the
units work out.

75
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,150
This kelvin is going to cancel
out with that kelvin in the

76
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,100
denominator.

77
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,450
This gram in the numerator
will cancel out with that

78
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,959
grams. And it makes sense.

79
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,180
Specific heat is the amount of
energy per mass per degree

80
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,510
that is required to push
it that 1 degree.

81
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,290
So here we're doing 58 degrees,
1,000 grams, you just

82
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:31,870
multiply it.

83
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,350
The units cancel out.

84
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,110
So you have kelvin canceling
out with kelvin.

85
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,880
You have grams canceling
out with grams.

86
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,030
And we are left with-- take out
the calculator, put it on

87
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,380
the side here.

88
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:57,660
So we have 58.29 times 1,000--
times one, two, three-- times

89
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,720
2.44 is equal to-- and
we only have three

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,890
significant digits here.

91
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,200
So this is going to be 142--
we'll just round down--

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,310
142,000 kelvin.

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,370
So this is 142,000.

94
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,820
Sorry 142,000 joules.

95
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,810
Joules is our units.

96
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,220
We want energy.

97
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,430
So this right here is the amount
of energy to take our

98
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,100
ethanol, our 1 kilogram of
ethanol, from 20 degrees

99
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,990
Celsius to 78.29 degrees
Celsius.

100
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,950
Or you could view this as from
293 kelvin to whatever this

101
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,850
number is plus 273, that
temperature in kelvin.

102
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,390
Either way, we've raised its
temperature by 58.29 kelvin.

103
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,980
Now, the next step is, it's
just a lot warmer ethanol,

104
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,900
liquid ethanol.

105
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,200
We now have to vaporize it.

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,750
It has to become vapor
at that temperature.

107
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,490
So now we have to add the
heat of vaporization.

108
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,460
So that's right here.

109
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,260
We should call it the enthalpy
of vaporization.

110
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,390
The enthalpy of vaporization,
they tell us, is

111
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,880
855 joules per gram.

112
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,980
And this is how much energy you
have to do to vaporize a

113
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,400
certain amount per
gram of ethanol.

114
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,570
Assuming that it's already
at the temperature of

115
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,460
vaporization, assuming that it's
already at its boiling

116
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,500
point, how much extra energy per
gram do you have to add to

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,880
actually make it vaporize?

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,960
So we have this much.

119
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,690
And we know we have 1,000
grams of enthanol.

120
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,990
The grams cancel out.

121
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:43,150
855 times 1,000 is
855,000 joules.

122
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,130
So it actually took a lot less
energy to make the ethanol go

123
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,220
from 20 degrees Celsius to 78.29
degrees Celsius than it

124
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,130
took it to stay at 78.29, but go
from the liquid form to the

125
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,790
vapor form.

126
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,180
This took the bulk
of the energy.

127
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,070
But if we want to know the total
amount of energy, let's

128
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,000
see if we can add this
up in our heads.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,910
855,000 plus 142,000.

130
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,120
800 plus 100 is 900.

131
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,340
That's 900,000.

132
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,720
50 plus 40 is 90.

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,970
5 plus 2 is 7.

134
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:25,500
So it's 997,000 joules
or 997 kilojoules.

135
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,220
Or we could say it's almost 1
megajoule, if we wanted to

136
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,360
speak in those terms. But that's
what it will take for

137
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,070
us to vaporize that 1
kilogram of ethanol.

138
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,320
ethanol.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,920
I thought I would do another
example of the partial quotient

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,370
method for long division,
so that it actually

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,619
has some positives to it, it
actually is kind of fun to do.

5
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,660
So let's say I want to do
something really hairy,

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,160
like 291 divided into--
let me just throw

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,861
some digits over
here-- 390-- actually,

8
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,610
let's throw another
digit right over here.

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,050
So this is, how
many times does 291

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,440
go into-- what is
this-- 9,873,952?

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,770
And to just kind of
get our bearings,

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,029
we know what 291 times 1 is.

13
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:34,820
That's pretty easy.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,590
291 times 1 is clearly just 291.

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,270
We know what 291 times 10 is.

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,252
That's clearly 2,910.

17
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,550
Now let's get some stuff in
between here that will help us

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,840
as we try to approximate
how many times 291 goes

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,380
into this crazy thing over here.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,270
So let's just pick.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,730
And in the last example,
I picked 2 and 5.

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,602
You could just pick
3 and 6 if you want.

23
00:00:58,602 --> 00:00:59,560
You could pick 2 and 7.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
You could pick
whatever you want.

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,250
You could even just do 1, one
of them, one of the above.

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,700
But let's just say 291 times--
let's try 3 out-- 291 times 3.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,260
So I could do this in my head.

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,110
Or just make sure I
don't make a mistake,

29
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,520
let me do it right over here.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,480
So 291 times 3 is--
1 times 3 is 3.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,950
9 times 3 is 27.

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,700
2 times 3 is 6.

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,390
6 plus 2 is 8.

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,220
So this is equal to 873.

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,010
It's actually strange that
873 showed up over there.

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,410
Maybe my brain is doing strange
things in the background.

37
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,159
But anyway, that has
actually no relevance

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,580
to the actual solution
of this problem.

39
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,146
And let's also try 291 times 6.

40
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,920

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,270
Let's figure out what that is.

42
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,110
So 291 times 6, it's
actually just going

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,330
to be this thing times 2.

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,660
But I'll just calculate it.

45
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,120
291 times 6-- 1 times 6 is 6.

46
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,330
9 times 6 is 54.

47
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,720
2 times 6 is 12, plus 5 is 17.

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,889
So it's 1,746.

49
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,850
And you might say,
Sal, why did you

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,210
go through the trouble of
figuring out this and this?

51
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,280
And I'm just using these
as some approximation tools

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,380
when we try to figure out
how many times 291 goes

53
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,895
into this whole crazy mess.

54
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:23,340
So first of all, let's just
look at this whole thing.

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,785
This is 9,873,000.

56
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:28,720
So let's just say, how
many times does 291

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,180
go into 9 million?

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,720
So 291 times 3 would be 873.

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,700
We want to have a bunch
of zeros after the 873.

60
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,550
So think of it this way--
and I'm picking 873,

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,910
because its leading digit is
as close to the 9 as possible.

62
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,420
But it's definitely
lower than the 9.

63
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,070
So you say, OK,
873-- and I'm going

64
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,060
to have one, two, three,
four zeros behind it.

65
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,086
So 291 times 3 will give me 873.

66
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,460
But I have to
multiply it times 3

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,830
with one, two, three,
four zeros to get

68
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,940
this number, 8.73 million.

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,640
So I have to multiply
it by 30,000.

70
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,500
But I got that straight from
this idea, that 291 times 3

71
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,320
is 873.

72
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,930
So let's subtract
this right over here.

73
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,880
Let's subtract this,
2 minus 0 is 2.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,170
5, 9, 3, 7 minus 3 is 4.

75
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,750
8 minus 7 is 1.

76
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,260
9 minus 8 is 1.

77
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,870
So now we're left
with 1,143,952.

78
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,190
So which of these just
gets us right under that?

79
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,105
So let's see.

80
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:43,830
Let's see.

81
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,750
If we want to go to-- we
can't go straight to 1,746,

82
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,410
that will be too big over here.

83
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,300
We might want to do 873 again.

84
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,590
But this time, we're
going to do it 873,000.

85
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,460
That is equal to 3-- and then
you have one, two, three zeros,

86
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,110
so one, two, three.

87
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,330
3 times 291 is 873.

88
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,240
3,000 is 873,000.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,910
Let me write this a
little bit neater.

90
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:19,620
My handwriting is-- so this is
going to be 3,000 times 291.

91
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,750
And just let me make sure.

92
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,959
This is a 2 right over here.

93
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,310
2 minus 0 is 2.

94
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,110
And then you subtract again.

95
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,630
2 minus 0 is 2.

96
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,370
5 minus 0 is 5.

97
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,850
9 minus 0 is 9.

98
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,390
3 minus 3 is 0.

99
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,460
And then you have 4 minus 7.

100
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,040
So the way I like
to do it when I

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,730
have to start
regrouping and borrowing

102
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,810
is making sure I
go from the left.

103
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,030
So this 1, I could
borrow from there,

104
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,310
so that this becomes an 11.

105
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,280
And then the 4, I can
borrow 1 from here,

106
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
so that becomes a 10.

107
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,160
And then this becomes a 14.

108
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,090
So 14 minus 7 is 7.

109
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,480
10 minus 8 is 2.

110
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,435
So I'm down to 270,952.

111
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,464
So what's right below that?

112
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:06,130
So it seems that we
can get pretty close

113
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,310
if we do 291 times 6,
so if you do a 1,746

114
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,240
and then add two zeros to it.

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,590
This is going to be
times 6 with two zeros,

116
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,290
so this is times 600.

117
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,561
Once again, you subtract.

118
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,810
And let's say I'm only using
the sixes and the threes,

119
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,180
because I figured those
out ahead of time,

120
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,763
so I didn't have to
do any extra math.

121
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:29,690
So 2 minus 0 is 2.

122
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,400
5 minus 0 is 5.

123
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,240
9 minus 6 is 3.

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,360
0 minus 4-- well,
there's a couple

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
of ways you could
think about doing this.

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
You could borrow from here.

127
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,030
That will become a 6.

128
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,450
This becomes a 10.

129
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,640
10 minus 4 is 6.

130
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,160
Now this one's lower, so
it has to borrow as well.

131
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,950
Make this into a 16.

132
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,107
16 minus 7-- and I have multiple
videos on how to borrow,

133
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,440
if I'm doing that part too fast.

134
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
But the idea here is to
show you a different way

135
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,170
of long division.

136
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,690
So 16 minus 7 is 9.

137
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,710
So now we're at 96,352.

138
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,530
And once again, it
looks like the 873

139
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,070
is about as close as we can get.

140
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,090
So let me put a 873 over
here with two zeros.

141
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,990
So that would literally
be 291 times 3

142
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,960
with two zeros times 300.

143
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,870
And so once again, we
want to subtract here.

144
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,860
2 minus 0-- you
get a 2, a 5, a 0.

145
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,180
Make this a 16.

146
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,020
Make this an 8.

147
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,400
16 minus 7 is 9.

148
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,760
And then we have to
get close to 9,052.

149
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,020
Once again, that 873, those
digits look pretty good, 873.

150
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,780
We have to multiply
3 and then 10,

151
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,950
so this is going to be
times 30 right over here.

152
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,720
We subtract again.

153
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,130
2 minus 0 is 2.

154
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,460
5 minus 3 is 2.

155
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,337
And then you have
90 minus 87 is 3.

156
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,670
I'm doing the subtraction a
little fast, just so that we

157
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,690
can get the general idea.

158
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,820
Then we have to go into 322.

159
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,853
And how can we
get close to that?

160
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,311
Well, actually, 291 is
pretty darn close to that.

161
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,260
So you go into it one time.

162
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,710
1 times 291 is 291.

163
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,990
2 minus 1 is 1.

164
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,070
32 minus 29 is 3.

165
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,730
So you have a remainder of 31.

166
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,714
291 cannot go into 31 any
more, so that's our remainder.

167
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,130
But how many times
did it actually

168
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,080
go into this big,
beastly number?

169
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,114
This 9,873,952?

170
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,530
Well there, we
just have to add up

171
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,960
all of these right over here.

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,890
30 plus 3,000-- we can even do
it in our head-- 30 plus 3,000

173
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,636
is 33,000.

174
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:46,330
33,600, 33,900,
33,931, and we are

175
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,380
done, assuming I haven't
made some silly mistake.

176
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,275
291 goes into this thing 33,931
times with a remainder of 31.

177
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:55,775

1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,394
Travelling up the Mekong River, we are heading for the point known as the Golden Triangle

2
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:25,451
where Loas on the right, Thailand on the left and Myanmar up ahead share a common border

3
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:32,009
When Mao Tse Tung's Red Army swept into Yunnan 10,000 Nationalist from the Kuomintang Army

4
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,783
fled into this region led by General Tang, better known as Khunsa

5
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:46,980
With the fall of Vietnam to Communism in the 1960's the United States and the West were fearful

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,344
of the Domino Effect in South East Asia, provided Khunsa with funds and arms to enable him

7
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:57,223
to fight Communist expansion.

8
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:04,089
Instead Khunsa expanded the existing opium cultivation by the hill tribes

9
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:10,424
He commenced opium cultivation and opium manufacturing to an industrial scale

10
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:17,371
In the 80's up to 70 % of the heroine in the west came from the Golden Triangle

11
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,301
Kunsa became the most wanted man in the world.

12
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,354
In the early 90's the Royal Thai Army destroyed Khunsa's Opium base and together with the

13
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:35,287
United Nations International Drug Control Program converted most of the opium fields to

14
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,530
tea, coffee and tobacco plantations.

15
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:48,313
Khunsa surrendered to the Burmese Govt in 1996 and passed away in 2007

16
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:59,391
All this while the Myanmar refused to extradite him to the USA even though he was charged for

17
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:02,060
opium smuggling in a New York Court.

18
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:12,245
With the opening of casinos at the Myanmar and Laos borders, the Golden Triangle looks set to

19
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:14,334
regain some of its previous notoriety and reputation.

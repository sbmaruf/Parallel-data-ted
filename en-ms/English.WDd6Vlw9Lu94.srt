Episode 16 - Final

3
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:41,251
How come you're riding a bike?

4
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:41,999
Oh, you came.

5
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,233
Yeah.

6
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,001
Oh, hi.

7
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,000
Hi.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,545
Is it a couple bike?

9
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:52,003
You're making it so obvious.

10
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,002
It's because of my mother.

11
00:00:54,002 --> 00:01:02,567
She tried to make us wear couple clothes as well, but I ran away.

12
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:08,233
But, you're not wearing the most important thing, the ring.

13
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,567
Oh, later . . .

14
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,004
I'm going to wear it once we get our marriage license.

15
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,567
Marriage license?

16
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:15,094
Nothing, let's go.

17
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:16,667
Yeah.

18
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:23,133
<i>

19
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:26,577
Really?!

20
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:27,007
Ha Ni . . .

21
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:32,067
So by law, you're not related specifically to him?

22
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:37,002
What are you talking about? The sky and land knows that we married.

23
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:40,433
Do you know how many witnesses there were? You came as well.

24
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,204
Because of that paper . . .

25
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,004
That's the power of a document.

26
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,867
The stamp's power.

27
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:53,167
That means that I have another chance yet.

28
00:01:53,167 --> 00:02:10,833
oh~~ yeah yeah, no wonder, I thought that this was too easy.

29
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,533
But is it true?

30
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,002
Yeah.

31
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,884
Is she going to do nursing because of you?Because you are going to be a doctor?

32
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:19,933
Yeah.

33
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,003
Oh Ha Ni is amazing.

34
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,009
She's like a star that orbits around Baek Seung Jo.

35
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,009
Isn't it expected that the earth orbits around the sun?

36
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:47,933
Oh my god, Baek Seung Jo you're the macho type?!

37
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:51,667
What? Still have a chance?

38
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:54,533
Can't believe it!

39
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:59,228
And what?! You're not going to register me until I'm able to pass the test to change majors?!

40
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:13,009
So mean and petty.

41
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,767
Okay.

42
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:22,000
Since it's mean and petty, I will pass.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,367
So we can make it like a buffet, and customers can personally make their own lunches with the food they like.

44
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:33,733
And if they order something they really like, then I can personally make it a lunch.

45
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,067
Doesn't that sound okay?

46
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,004
Hello.

47
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:39,333
Welcome! Aigoo. You came?

48
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,009
Welcome.

49
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,033
Hey.

50
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:55,033
Eh?

51
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,133
What would you like?

52
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,004
Today, I want to eat Sam Gye Noodles.

53
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,316
Why do you always eat noodles?

54
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,533
You should eat rice, and bread as well.

55
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:08,267
Better than noodles, I wanted to eat the seasoned cucumber. It tastes so nice.

56
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,000
Probably I'm addicted to it.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,733
Ah, what should I do? There's no seasoned cucumber left.

58
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:17,000
Eh? Really?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,005
What is that? It sure does look fancy.

60
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:25,133
It's a tereré, which you use to drink mate tea cold! Have some!

61
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,867
Why should I drink what you have been drinking?

62
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,001
We usually share this between people. It means that you're friends.

63
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,333
Why would people share this one thing?

64
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,006
I'll catch something from it! Put it away!

65
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:38,233
You won't get sick. Tereré has a component that kills bacteria.

66
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,005
Drink it so we can be friends.

67
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:42,867
I don't want to be your friend. Just eat the noodles and go okay?

68
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:46,233
Then be my boyfriend.

69
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:46,933
What?

70
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,006
I like you Mr. Bong. I liked you at first sight.

71
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,733
Let's be a couple.

72
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:56,005
Oh my goodness, this girl is absolutely crazy! Didn't I say that I have someone that I like?

73
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:59,004
Liar! I came everyday and haven't seen her once!

74
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:00,533
I haven't seen you date as well

75
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,433
If I like someone, do I have to go on dates and be a couple with them?

76
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:07,667
Just by myself, in my heart, I see this one person.

77
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,533
What is that?

78
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:24,733
You, don't come from now on. Alright? Don't come!

79
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,733
Oh Min Ah.

80
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,433
I'm going right now.

81
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:36,367
I'll see you later.

82
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:37,767
Oh! Ha Ni.

83
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,067
Long time, no see.

84
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,167
Sunbae!

85
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,003
Why don't you come to practice tennis nowadays?

86
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,267
Just because you got married, you're skipping?

87
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:48,033
It's not that.

88
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:51,933
Change of major? Are you being serious?

89
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,007
Yes, I'm desperate.

90
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:58,533
I know a little about it because one of my friends is in the nursing program.

91
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,009
Employment and competition is really fierce for that program,

92
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,967
so not many people get in. How are you supposed to change into that major when you don't even have a chance?

93
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:07,006
I know that,

94
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:10,667
then what do I do? I really have to get in.

95
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:15,001
You're probably better off just studying again and reapplying at university under that major.

96
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,009
Try again? No way.

97
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,433
There's no way that the typhoon's gonna come at that time again.

98
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,833
Typhoon?

99
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,033
There's something like that.

100
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,667
Ha Ni!

101
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,006
I, had "something."

102
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:33,567
Something?

103
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,553
With Hae Ra?

104
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:39,267
Are you dating?

105
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:45,567
We're not exactly dating, but we are eating hot dogs together.

106
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,005
Hot dogs?

107
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,004
What is that?

108
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:51,003
Hot dogs are very important.

109
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:55,001
Yah, but how could it be like this?

110
00:06:55,001 --> 00:07:00,067
Can a person like another person this much?

111
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:07,233
Sunbae! It is very possible a person can like another person that much.

112
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:11,833
Joo Ri!

113
00:07:11,833 --> 00:08:02,006
You came?

114
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:08,633
At first, his hair was pretty long. Maybe up to his shoulders? Isn't it long?

115
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:15,033
He comes everyday and tells me to cut it little by little. That's why it's that short.

116
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:25,867
But the strange thing is, he comes a bit later after work hours, and that's why I cut it.

117
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:29,233
He's coming to see you.

118
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:32,001
It could be like that.

119
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,001
To you who doesn't have certification, pretty great.

120
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,004
I've been studying.

121
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:43,333
Hey Jung Joo Ri, if you leave me and start dating, it'll be the end of our friendship.

122
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:49,433
Hey, since you're always in a room drawing all the time, that's why you haven't dated yet.

123
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,008
Aigoo Dok Go Min Ah, it's a waste of your face.

124
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:54,004
Why? She's cool.

125
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,009
Your cartoon ratings are really high.

126
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,004
I uploaded a new one yesterday. Do you want to see it?

127
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:01,767
Why did you draw me so fat again?

128
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,008
Because you're fat.

129
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:10,467
-How can you draw like this?-My arms are so big!

130
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:15,001
Omo, it's really the same.

131
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:20,433
Hey! What is this? Why did you draw something like this?

132
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:27,008
This Oh Ha Ni is now Seung Jo's wife.That's something to see while living.

133
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:33,267
Right? I found it interesting while I was drawing.

134
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:45,133
I'm not his wife yet.

135
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,007
Everyone says it's not going to work.

136
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,009
The test to change majors is hard.

137
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,333
But they say there's no way there are spots available in the nursing program.

138
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,467
Really?

139
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:05,833
What should I do, Mother? Marriage license.

140
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,667
Ha Ni...!

141
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,009
Follow me.

142
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,007
Marriage license.

143
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,667
We can just do it then.

144
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:20,003
What is this? Doing it his own way? What is he?

145
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:23,267
But still, I promised.

146
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:28,467
How is that a promise? He did it alone.

147
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,133
Oh, it's here.

148
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,006
Marriage license.

149
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,833
Signatures of 2 witnesses.

150
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,467
Well, your father-in-law and I can do that.

151
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,633
Will it be okay?

152
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,267
It's alright, it's alright.

153
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,004
First we'll report it, and then you can take the test.

154
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:53,433
You pass for the report and the report for your passing. It's just a different way of going about it.

155
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,167
Is that so?

156
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:58,002
Of course. What's the point in waiting when we don't even know when a spot will open up for you!

157
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:02,333
This is the problem. Identification.

158
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,367
We need Seung Jo's ID.

159
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,367
ID?

160
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:18,685
Does Seung Jo always carry around his ID?

161
00:11:18,685 --> 00:12:09,243
Good

162
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,455
What are you doing?

163
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:14,143
Why are you looking at someone else's wallet?

164
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,744
What do you mean looking through?

165
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:19,044
Your wallet was pretty so I was just looking at it.

166
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,971
Ah, it's so cute!

167
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:24,447
Should I buy a couple's wallet too?

168
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,779
Hey, Oh Ha Ni.

169
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,677
Are you touching your husband's wallet already?

170
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:33,577
It's not that.

171
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,071
It seems like there are a couple bills missing.

172
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:44,031
Hey what are you talking about? What do you see me as?

173
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,777
Aren't you gonna sleep?

174
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:52,829
I am.

175
00:12:52,829 --> 00:14:11,005
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

176
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,609
It's already been reported.

177
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,009
What?

178
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,059
That can't be.

179
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,899
This is the first time we've been here.

180
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,115
Really?!

181
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:23,076
But why is it already done?

182
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:26,876
Your husband registered it. Mr. Baek Seung Jo.

183
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:42,139
Baek Seung Jo?

184
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,691
Did you know that I took it?

185
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:48,476
Did you not know what was in here?

186
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,955
Seung Jo.

187
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,327
Why do you tease her so much?

188
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,292
It's fun.

189
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,329
I live for teasing Oh Ha Ni.

190
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,109
She tries hard when she has a goal.

191
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:01,576
Changing into the nursing program isn't easy.

192
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,965
I did it on purpose so that she would set her mind to it.

193
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:06,019
But then you touch my wallet.

194
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,055
I'm disappointed in you.

195
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,176
No.

196
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,676
I'm gonna do it. I'll do it!

197
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,361
I'll work hard.

198
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,369
Don't be disappointed.

199
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,009
Well 1,000 hand outs for the time being.

200
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,249
Ok.

201
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:22,232
Let's see how many lunch boxes...

202
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:25,109
Hey, but...

203
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:28,109
When will you finish all this?

204
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:33,559
The end is right in front of us so I think I'll have to pull an all-nighter.

205
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,503
Hey, but...

206
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:41,143
After that day, Chris hasn't shown up.

207
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:42,443
Is that so?

208
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:49,009
I was so busy I didn't know.

209
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,295
Ah paper cups...

210
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:58,868
Breathing techniques for the Heimlich maneuver...

211
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:02,556
Breathe into the mouth...

212
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,979
Ha Ni, Ha Ni.

213
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:07,187
Hello.

214
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:08,461
Really?!

215
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:10,012
Joon Gu?

216
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,072
Sit down.

217
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:14,808
Joon Gu is so cool!

218
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,576
By any chance, because the food is so good...

219
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:21,183
You're not confused are you? That could happen.

220
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:23,209
No. I like everything.

221
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,543
I like the way he looks. I like how he's like a man.

222
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:30,011
And especially the way he talks. It's like he's singing.

223
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,387
Oh I see.

224
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:34,076
I have to go to England on Christmas Eve.

225
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,643
But I don't want to go. I want to be with him.

226
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:39,876
If Mr. Bong tells me not to go, I'm not going.

227
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,068
You like him that much?

228
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:44,909
But Mr. Bong said that he has someone he likes.

229
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,707
Is that true?

230
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,943
Who is it?

231
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:54,328
He said that?

232
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:56,709
No. There's no such person.

233
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,377
Really?!

234
00:16:58,377 --> 00:16:59,543
I knew it!

235
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,476
Then Ha Ni, help me a bit.

236
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,776
Tell Mr. Bong that I'm pretty.

237
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:05,309
Alright.

238
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,576
So Pal Bok Lunches!

239
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,639
Here, here, here.

240
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,409
Hello!

241
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:15,985
Hello, welcome to So Pal Bok. Please go inside.

242
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:18,909
Wow, this is great Bong Joon Gu.

243
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:21,576
You had this kind of ability?

244
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,689
This is just for your opening.

245
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,571
Where did you leave Ha Ni and why are you with this girl?

246
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:29,809
Joon Gu!

247
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:31,043
Hello.

248
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:32,776
Ha Ni, you came? Good job!

249
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:36,309
This is so that your business will unravel into greatness.

250
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,709
Buying this kind of present in this country...

251
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:41,976
I told her to buy it.

252
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,109
Oh really? Okay good job, good job!

253
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:46,543
We actually need this.

254
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,043
Oh it's 3 fold!

255
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,076
Thanks!

256
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:50,609
Boss Bong!

257
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,876
Your honored guests are here so you should say something.

258
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:55,909
Chef, what would I say? You may do it

259
00:17:55,909 --> 00:18:09,409
What are you talking about? Boss Bong has to do it.

260
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:12,609
Although there may be some that already know...

261
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,609
There's a book known as the Michelin Guide.

262
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:18,143
It's a book that introduces the best restaurants around the world.

263
00:18:18,143 --> 00:18:21,427
Getting even 1 star in that book is the most honorable thing ever!

264
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:24,876
The restaurant becomes a worldwide landmark overnight!

265
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,109
At first I thought they were really jerks.

266
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,709
Who are they to put stars next to someone else's food?

267
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:35,509
Right? But then the way they rate the food isn't just that it tastes good!

268
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:39,076
But it's about whether the food is always good no matter when you go.

269
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:46,376
A star is only given if the taste of the food is always great whether the chef goes through heartache or happiness.

270
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:52,709
So I too would like to receive a star with So Pal Bok Lunches!

271
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,976
Then the Goddess So Pal Bok in Heaven...

272
00:18:55,976 --> 00:19:03,943
would be so happy, right?

273
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,376
Thank you. Thank you.

274
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,376
You're so cool, Mr. Bong.

275
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:09,376
Ah, Mr. Bong.

276
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:12,276
I have to go to England, but I don't want to go.

277
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,109
Tell me not to, then I won't.

278
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:19,109
What the hell are you talking about?!

279
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,009
Did I not tell you? ...

280
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:25,476
... I have no one but Ha Ni.

281
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,143
Ha Ni?

282
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:30,443
Oh Ha Ni?

283
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:33,209
Yeah, I have no one but Ha Ni.

284
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:37,109
You're going to England? Okay, go go go. Go and don't come back, okay?

285
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:44,176
Bong Joon Gu.

286
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:45,809
Oh hey.

287
00:19:45,809 --> 00:20:07,343
Chris!

288
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,843
What should I do?

289
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:13,843
Chris decided she was going to go to England.

290
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:15,876
She trusted me and told me everything.

291
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:19,343
I feel like I betrayed her.

292
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,143
Then why did you get involved in someone else's business?

293
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:26,876
She told me to help her.

294
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,876
You must like it.

295
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:31,276
For an ahjumma to have a scandal and all.

296
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:34,043
Why are you being like that!

297
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:35,776
But...

298
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,443
What exactly happened?

299
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:41,576
You and Bong Joon Gu.

300
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,776
What happened...

301
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,276
that he's acting that way even though we got married?

302
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,476
Nothing happened.

303
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,876
It's just Joon Gu's character.

304
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,509
During Freshman year in high school...

305
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,876
Are you jealous?

306
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:58,243
Hey!

307
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:00,976
Who's jealous?

308
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:05,576
Jealous?!

309
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,343
Ah just leave it.

310
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:11,343
Let those two figure it out on their own.

311
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,576
If you keep getting involved...

312
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:16,443
it might get worse.

313
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,843
Maybe?

314
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,243
Yeah.

315
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:21,476
Just leave them alone,

316
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:24,176
until they figure everything out.

317
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:28,109
I guess so.

318
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,043
You did that too, didn't you?

319
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:32,376
What?

320
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,743
You too,

321
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:35,509
after leaving everything alone,

322
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,609
you found out your true feelings.

323
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:38,909
Ah,really.

324
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:39,676
I'm right, huh?

325
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:40,843
Hey, just study.

326
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:44,809
I'm right, aren't I? You were jealous earlier weren't you?

327
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:45,543
I said I'm not!

328
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,809
I know you were.

329
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,676
Are you crazy?

330
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:55,543
Hey! Aigoo cute.

331
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:56,809
Did you finish all the leftover dishes?

332
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,776
I'll get housewife's eczema like this!

333
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,443
Me too.

334
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:03,209
But, she's really not coming.

335
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,009
Who?

336
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,143
Chris.

337
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:09,009
Yeah. Did she leave already?

338
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,209
Hey, hurry and come!

339
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,476
Let's hurry.

340
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:19,603
Hello!

341
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,737


342
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:28,097


343
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:32,007
Chris is leaving.

344
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,825
You heard, right?

345
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:37,331
What does that have to do with me?

346
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:39,703
Tell me honestly.

347
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,237
Do you not like Chris?

348
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:42,507
Well . . .

349
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:45,007
There's nothing not to like . . .

350
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,067
Doesn't not seeing her make you curious?

351
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,106
You miss her, right?

352
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,837
No way.

353
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:55,025
To me, you're the only one. Didn't I tell you?

354
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,837
I told you

355
00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:02,703
that you're my family.

356
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,837
I'm married, Joon Gu.

357
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:09,686
Now, Seung Jo is my family.

358
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:12,937
Yeah, that's right.

359
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:14,087
Ah, in that case

360
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:16,603
Then insurance!

361
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,625
Think of it like you took on insurance!

362
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,037
Whenever you're having a hard time, then look for me then!

363
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:25,665
Don't people look to insurance when they're having a hard time or in a sticky situation?

364
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:29,537
Joon Gu

365
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:33,087
Sit here.

366
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:46,047
Hurry.

367
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:48,875
All this time, Joon Gu, you . . .

368
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,603
you've supported me with everything I have done,

369
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:55,803
cheering me on and doing as I asked.

370
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:59,803
Thank you.

371
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,123
So this time too,

372
00:24:02,123 --> 00:24:04,803
just this once,

373
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:08,037
just listen to me once more.

374
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:12,097
Sit here and calmly think about it.

375
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:15,237
"My heart feels this way"

376
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,103
"I know myself."

377
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:20,939
Don't just keep telling yourself that.

378
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:26,937
Just leave your heart to the swaying swing

379
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:31,027
while looking up at the sky.

380
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:36,803
They say that then you'll really see your own feelings.

381
00:24:36,803 --> 00:26:12,311
Try it.

382
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:13,937
And so?

383
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:16,886
What do you want me to do about you receiving your draft notice?

384
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:20,537
Ah, no it's not that you should do something,

385
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,307
it's just, I don't know either.

386
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:27,237
For some reason, I thought I should tell you.

387
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:30,471
Why?

388
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:34,422
Don't tell me it's because I cried in front of you that day.

389
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:37,053
You don't think there's something special between us, right?

390
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,081
Oh, no!

391
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,291
Am I a fool?

392
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,629
When I knew why you were crying,

393
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:47,947
I didn't think that, so don't worry.

394
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:52,637
Then that's a relief.

395
00:26:52,637 --> 00:26:55,806
I

396
00:26:55,806 --> 00:27:00,045
I'm just saying this so

397
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:02,771
don't feel burdened.

398
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:07,038
Ok.

399
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,438
When you're bored

400
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:14,338
When you really have nothing to do and you're really bored,

401
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:18,171
a letter . . .

402
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:21,675
Would you write a letter to me?

403
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,471
I don't want to.

404
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:25,728
It's bothersome, it's not even e-mail.

405
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:29,852
Right, it's not even an email.

406
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:33,638
Where do you have the time to write it, put a stamp on it, find a mailbox?

407
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:36,048
I probably couldn't do it either.

408
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:40,064
With that time you might as well sleep!

409
00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:50,007
Yes.

410
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:57,366
Yeah...

411
00:27:57,366 --> 00:28:14,104
Then, I'll go.

412
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:16,694
Hae Ra

413
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:21,019
I have another favor to ask.

414
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,814
This is a real favor.

415
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:27,027
From now on,

416
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:31,471
don't cry alone.

417
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:35,616
Back then, you cried into my shoulder.

418
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,028
It didn't feel very good,

419
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:44,138
like my bones were melting or something.

420
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,039
I'm really going now.

421
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,438
Be well.

422
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:57,504
If I'm really bored . . .

423
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:39,011
I'll come visit you.

424
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:43,542
Sleepy . . .

425
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,592
I don't know when a spot will open up,

426
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:49,479
so I don't even want to do it.

427
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:53,376
No, Seung Jo is expecting me to do this.

428
00:29:53,376 --> 00:30:18,656
Right, I can't disappoint Seung Jo.

429
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:24,182
S.J HEARTS H.NHappy Love

430
00:30:24,182 --> 00:30:36,096
FIGHTING!

431
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:39,038
Come outside.

432
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:39,638
Why?

433
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:43,951
I have something to say.

434
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:46,966
Really?

435
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:50,699
I guess there are times the draft comes out this quickly too.

436
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:51,936
What a pity.

437
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,686
Oh really?

438
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:57,078
You're the only one sad to hear that I'm going to the army.

439
00:30:57,078 --> 00:31:01,024
Even my parents were glad, because tuition is so expensive.

440
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:04,352
But I didn't come here to say that.

441
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:06,422
I wanted to thank you.

442
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,803
To me?For what?

443
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:11,002
Didn't you always tell me?

444
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,987
You don't need to prepare special events or anything.

445
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:15,387
Just sincerely

446
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:18,539
telling the truth is best.

447
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,811
Of course.

448
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:23,424
Did you confess?

449
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,747
To Hae Ra?

450
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:30,144
Why would I confess? But I did do something similar to confessing.

451
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:32,875
Did you know...

452
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,374
Honestly, watching you I've learned a lot.

453
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:39,574
I didn't do it at all because I was afraid of failing.

454
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:42,603
Or being afraid of being rejected so I didn't confess.

455
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:44,544
I was always like that.

456
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:47,431
But watching you I began to think, who cares if I fail.

457
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:50,002
And who cares if I get rejected.

458
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,139
This was my way of thinking, this mindset.

459
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:54,707
I learned all of this watching you.

460
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:57,707
There are a few things I know!

461
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:02,187
In any case, thanks to you I had a fun time.

462
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,256
That's why

463
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,944
this older brother of yours would like to..

464
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:09,682
give my Ha Ni a present.

465
00:32:09,682 --> 00:32:10,998
Really?

466
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:13,814
Ok, give it to me.

467
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:16,288
Not that kind.

468
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:20,056
You said you wanted to get into the nursing program right?

469
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:21,558
When I go to the army,

470
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:23,991
I'll open up a spot for you in the nursing program.

471
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:27,595
How could you do that Sunbae? You're not even in the nursing program.

472
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:29,963
Ha Ni

473
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:32,736
In this world our country is the only one that

474
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:35,872
has a very great system known as the accompanying draft system.

475
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:39,891
Remember last time when I said I had a friend in the nursing program?

476
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,498
He's a man. He shares a room with me.

477
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:45,643
When I get drafted, I'll take him with me.

478
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:47,122
Really?!

479
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:48,008
He said he'll go with you?!

480
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:53,087
What's he going to do if he doesn't go? I'm taking away the room from him!

481
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:55,968
If I get rid of the room he has nowhere to go!

482
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:57,895
If I go to the army he has to go to the army too.

483
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,312
If I go to a secluded island, he has to go and catch tuna or something--

484
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,168
Sunbaenim!

485
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:05,696
So I'll make a spot somehow.

486
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:06,004
The exam.

487
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:10,098
I can't do anything with the exam! So you have to do well and get accepted!

488
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,584
Aah of course!

489
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:17,366
Aaaah! Assa! Thank you so much, really!

490
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:23,062
Sunbae! Thank you! Sunbaenim!

491
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:24,812
Thank you!

492
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:26,354
Are you this happy to see me go into the army?

493
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:59,007
Yes, I'm so happy.

494
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:04,367
Please cut it short.

495
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:13,733
It's already very short. Do you want to make it shorter?

496
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:21,067
Oh, okay.

497
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:37,005
I'm going to the army.

498
00:34:37,005 --> 00:35:00,233
Then . . . we can't do it with this.

499
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,009
It's okay.

500
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:04,002
Don't worry,

501
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:08,333
I will wait for you.

502
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:14,833
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

503
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:21,767
I requested a change of majors!

504
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,009
The exam is right away.

505
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:26,016
Yeah. There aren't many days left.

506
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,003
But what can I do?

507
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:30,155
The competition is intense.

508
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,067
Do well.

509
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,009
How can you go to sleep already?

510
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:35,267
What do you want?

511
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,233
You have to help me study!

512
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:39,243
Pick out the questions you think are going to appear on the exam. It's your major.

513
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:41,007
What are you talking about?!

514
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,633
Please Mr. ESP Baek!

515
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,867
I beg of you.

516
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,533
In order to inspect the patient's nutritional status,

517
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:53,433
when is the best time to inspect the patient's abdomen?

518
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:56,003
4 to 5 hours after a meal.

519
00:35:56,003 --> 00:36:01,007
The 3 premises of setting up a goal in order to motivate someone?

520
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:04,003
Be detailed.

521
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:07,967
It must be achievable and yet slightly hard.

522
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,833
Also . . .

523
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,000
By yourself . . .

524
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,082
That's right! It has to be set on your own.

525
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:18,008
See, you need a goal to be more motivated.

526
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:21,233
I even set up a goal for you.

527
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:22,633
I have a goal!

528
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:24,133
What is it?

529
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,333
If I pass this time,

530
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,002
a date on Christmas Day.

531
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,933
A date?

532
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:35,003
We got married without even a proper date.

533
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:37,005
And during the honeymoon, too.

534
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:42,033
If I pass, let's go on a date.

535
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,767
All right.

536
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:46,133
All day. Full.

537
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:47,367
Fine.

538
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,533
Awesome!

539
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,967
Shall we practice the practical skill portion?

540
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:54,433
The practical skill is giving CPR.

541
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,009
I read about it, but

542
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:57,767
I still haven't tried it yet.

543
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:01,000
About 100 compressions per minute.

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,833
So then,

545
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,009
One-Two-Three.

546
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,236
About this much.

547
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:09,633
Ok, I'll try it.

548
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:15,567
The Heimlich maneuver.

549
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:21,133
Uhh, check for breathing.

550
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,633
There's no breath.

551
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:27,533
Open the airway, mouth to mouth

552
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:31,533
Hey, what are you doing?

553
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,567
This is an emergency.

554
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,733
You're feeling it?

555
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,002
That's not it! What do you mean "feeling" it?

556
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:39,433
Hurry, what's next?

557
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,233
Okay.

558
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:45,533
Next, chest compressions, 30 times . . .

559
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:49,333
One-two-three-four-five.

560
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,567
Hey!

561
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:53,002
Are you treating a sick person or a healthy person right now?

562
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:54,633
Huh?

563
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,004
I thought it would hurt.

564
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:58,666
Harder?

565
00:37:58,666 --> 00:37:59,833
One-two. . .

566
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,066
Arms straight.

567
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:04,033
Four -- how is this?

568
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,367
Five...Six...Seven...Eight...

569
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,003
Rest a bit.

570
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:13,004
Come here.

571
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:16,967
I have a lot to do.

572
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:23,267
This is study as well.

573
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,433
Ah, Eun Joo.

574
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:29,967
I wanted to ask you something.

575
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,765
Gosh. . . hyung!

576
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,007
Oh Ha Ni sister-in-law!

577
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:36,733
Next to your room there's a way before adolescence' me

578
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,733
So please watch yourselves

579
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,167
Yeah.

580
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:51,233
I'm sorry.

581
00:38:51,233 --> 00:39:00,002
Here, take these to relax!

582
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:02,033
Did you say it was 2 sessions?

583
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:07,433
The first is the writing exam and the second is the interview.

584
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:11,005
What would they ask? I'm so nervous.

585
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:13,267
No there's no need for that.

586
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:17,000
You'll do fine after eating this!

587
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,433
Hurry and go. It's almost time.

588
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,003
Ha Ni, Fighting!

589
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:32,033
Fighting!

590
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:55,967
She could have taken the easy route, but she chooses the hardest one!

591
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:59,333
Gosh, how does he know exactly what's on it?

592
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:04,133
I really must have married an amazing man.

593
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:09,933
Min Ah, what if I really get into the nursing program like this?

594
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:12,000
Number 68, Oh Ha Ni.

595
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,867
Yes.

596
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:27,767
I'll get back to you later.

597
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:33,933
<i>Interviewer</i>

598
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:42,233
Hello, I'm number 68, Oh Ha Ni.

599
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:46,767
By any chance are you the snail?

600
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,667
So you eventually got in.

601
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,367
Why should we choose you?

602
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:57,000
Ah, yes, as an additional acceptee.

603
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,003
Oh, you got lucky.

604
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:05,633
A quick and accurate act of CPR,

605
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:08,003
increases the probability of survival by 3 times.

606
00:41:08,003 --> 00:41:11,005
But if it's done incorrectly the patient can die as well.

607
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:16,001
In real life someone gave CPR to someone whose heart stopped.

608
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:19,767
They did it incorrectly and eventually went to jail.

609
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,002
Really? It had to be done for the person to live.

610
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:27,833
- After all, murder is murder.- Murder?!

611
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,367
What would you do?

612
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:37,008
If someone can live or die by me giving CPR,

613
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:39,433
I have to try,

614
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,233
hoping they'll live.

615
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,004
Is that so?

616
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:51,733
Then, try it!

617
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,004
You have to check to see if they're conscious first!

618
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:56,067
Oh?

619
00:41:56,067 --> 00:42:13,166
Are you alright?

620
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:16,832
You're not going to report it?

621
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:29,001
Someone please call 119!

622
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:37,267
Hey, are you treating a sick person or a healthy person here?

623
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:40,733
Stop. That's enough.

624
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:47,667
The people of our country will not call it in unless you say, "YOU do it!".

625
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:52,233
Just a second ago you said "Please report it!", right?

626
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:55,567
The call probably still hasn't been made yet.

627
00:42:55,567 --> 00:43:00,367
And you have to press in hard enough for it to be 4-5 centimeters deep.

628
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:05,002
But you nearly crushed them with 6-7 centimeters deep.

629
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,633
This patient probably is 100%

630
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:12,003
dead from a broken rib piercing their lung.

631
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:14,333
If this was a real situation,

632
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:17,533
you just murdered someone.

633
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:25,009
We can't choose a murderer as a nurse.

634
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:29,733
It was announced on the spot.

635
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,633
She said they can't pick a murderer.

636
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:33,006
Oh my goodness!

637
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:35,000
What did I say?

638
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,933
I told you that Oh Ha Ni sister-in-law and being a nurse just doesn't match.

639
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:42,067
That's right.

640
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:46,033
I was nervous even though it was a mannequin.

641
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,007
When she said the mannequin was dead,

642
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:51,333
my heart dropped.

643
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,333
How in the world could I treat a person?

644
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,633
Ha Ni.

645
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,033
Then, what are you going to do?

646
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:02,733
I must have reached beyond my abilities, Dad.

647
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:07,033
I shouldn't have made the decision so easily.

648
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:10,002
Oh, I should hurry and pick a major.

649
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:21,467
I will go upstairs first.

650
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:24,433
It seems Ha Ni is quite upset.

651
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:49,201
Really. She must be really ill fated with that professor.

652
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:53,367
What to do? I guess there's no date after all!

653
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:57,244
There's nothing we can do.

654
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:03,587
I'm going crazy because I want to go on a date with Oh Ha Ni!

655
00:45:03,587 --> 00:45:08,667
I can't break it because a promise is a promise.

656
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:14,233
Shouldn't just having dinner together be alright?

657
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:29,947
Really?

658
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:31,576
Hey!

659
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:34,009
What are you doing in here, doing this? A young guy like you should be playing outside.

660
00:45:34,009 --> 00:45:40,093
Why should I do anything on Jesus's birthday?

661
00:45:40,093 --> 00:45:42,867
That's right!

662
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:46,167
Chris is leaving today, right?

663
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:50,299
That's right, Chris said she was going to leave on Christmas Eve.

664
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:52,007
That's right.

665
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:58,733
Really, she said it was a 7:00 o'clock plane. I'm sure of it!

666
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:04,644
Aigoo!

667
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:18,617
Right about now, she should be at the airport.

668

669
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:58,617
This would be good.

670
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:06,396
He said that this bag looked pretty.

671
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:18,004
I'm late!

672
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:34,009
Cell phone!

673
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:48,251
Motorcycles are trouble makers!

674
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:53,267
I'm sorry. Is there any way that I could get there faster?

675
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:59,000
What can I do with the traffic?

676
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,006
What should I do?

677
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:06,652
There's an accident.

678
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:10,169
Anyway, motorcycles cause accidents!

679
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:11,733
Is that person dead?

680
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:14,287
Are you alright, young lady?

681
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:24,781
What should we do? What should we do?

682
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,211
Someone do something.

683
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:28,365
You've just murdered someone!

684
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:30,333
Are you alright?

685
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,572
What to do?!

686
00:48:33,572 --> 00:48:35,002
She seems to be unconscious!

687
00:48:35,002 --> 00:48:40,015
Did anybody call the ambulance? Someone call the ambulance!

688
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:41,856
What should we do?

689
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:47,104
No air for 5 minutes is brain damage and over 10 minutes is death.

690
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:51,004
Let her be!

691
00:48:51,004 --> 00:48:53,521
If you wrongly move a hurt person

692
00:48:53,521 --> 00:49:22,092
and damage the spine, they can become paralyzed completely.

693
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,003
Did someone call the ambulance?

694
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,015
Someone must have.

695
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,067
No one called?

696
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:29,889
Ajusshi with the blue jacket.

697
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:30,433
Phone?

698
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:31,433
Call 119.

699
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:40,002
Oh, yes.

700
00:49:40,002 --> 00:49:43,524
Oh. She's alive! She's alive!

701
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:45,067
That's a relief!

702
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,433
What kind of person is she?

703
00:49:46,433 --> 00:50:00,816
Oh my god, that's such a relief.

704
00:50:00,816 --> 00:50:01,768
Excuse me!

705
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:03,184
Do you have a ticket?

706
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:06,333
Did the plane going to the UK leave? Can't I just go in for a second?!

707
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,367
- You can't go in without a ticket.- It'll just be a minute!

708
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:15,467
Just for one minute.

709
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:23,067
What's up with you, Bong Joon Gu? Why are you here? Are you crazy?

710
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:27,006
Mr. Bong.

711
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:30,861
I was right. So I was right!

712
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:37,967
I saw everything. You came here to get me, right? You're here to tell me not to go.

713
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:42,801
I didn't come here to stop you. I came here to see you off.

714
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:46,713
I came here late because there was traffic in the subway.

715
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:50,003
How come you're here and not inside?<Br> Did I get the time wrong?

716
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:54,029
No, I went inside and just came back out.

717
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:57,003
If I went in, then my heart,

718
00:50:57,003 --> 00:51:21,267
I thought it would hurt so much right here.

719
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:25,433
Tonight, it's really just me.

720
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:29,087
Ha Ni went to see her husband.

721
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:35,009
Jong Gu . . . looks like he went to the airport.

722
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:40,121
That rascal.

723
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:49,867
Merry Christmas!

724
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:51,438
She's all right.

725
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:55,367
You've done well. Did you learn first aid?

726
00:51:55,367 --> 00:52:00,509
I didn't learn it, I just . . .

727
00:52:00,509 --> 00:52:22,767
If you didn't do it, then something big could have happened. You saved a person.

728
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:24,683
Customer,

729
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,333
Business hours are over.

730
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,367
Yeah.

731
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:31,633
Excuse me.

732
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:38,006
Yes.

733
00:52:38,006 --> 00:53:23,033
It's nothing.

734
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,002
There was an accident on the way.

735
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:29,367
If you were going to send a message, you should've sent it fast.

736
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:33,283
I was worried that something happened.

737
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:35,359
Are you okay?

738
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,833
Nothing big, right?

739
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:50,085
Yeah.

740
00:53:50,085 --> 00:54:05,359
I thought you left.

741
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,467
I'm hungry.

742
00:54:08,467 --> 00:54:13,004
Let's at least eat a hamburger somewhere.

743
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:22,767
Never mind. Where would we go like this? <Br> We'd better go home.

744
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:32,657
It's really hard to have one date.

745
00:54:32,657 --> 00:54:35,223
Even though I had told you that before.

746
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:41,757
Ha Ni is right here. If not for Ha Ni, I wouldn't have been here right now.

747
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:45,357
Whether that is loyalty, friendship, or love,

748
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:51,723
whatever it's called, Ha Ni is nailed in right here.

749
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:53,633
Do you understand?,

750
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:54,523
So what?

751
00:54:54,523 --> 00:55:00,029
So... so... because of that...

752
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:03,923
I mean, I can't erase it, ever. Are you okay with that?

753
00:55:03,923 --> 00:55:05,723
I don't like it! How can it be okay with me?

754
00:55:05,723 --> 00:55:08,523
Then I can't do anything. Go!

755
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,049
Then I'm going to nail it in too!,

756
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:14,657
If Ha Ni is just 1 nail, then I'm going to nail in 10, 20, 100 nails.

757
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:19,467
I'm going to nail it all over Mr. Bong's body!

758
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:22,023
Are you trying to kill me?!

759
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:26,019
With that many nails a person will die, not live!

760
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:27,657
Even 1 is this hard.

761
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,257
Really? Then . . .

762
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:33,079
Oh flowers! I'll cover you with flowers!

763
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:38,059
Because I don't like it when Mr.Bong is going through a hard time.

764
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:42,039
Kiddo, give up on the analogies.

765
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:45,257
I made a new batch of stuffed cucumber.

766
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:48,423
Why don't you come and have some of that?

767
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:51,019
Come on, let's go.

768
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:57,039
Hey, let go! People are watching!

769
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,223
Hurry, hurry!

770
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:10,823
Hey, wait. Let's go together.

771
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:14,223
Aren't cars not allowed here at night time?

772
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:16,598
Probably.

773
00:56:16,598 --> 00:56:19,039
Then why did you go in? What if we get caught?

774
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:21,557
Just don't get caught.

775
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:25,923
Isn't it exciting doing something we're not supposed to do?

776
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:30,323
As long as we don't get caught.

Ah, I'm sorry.

791

It's just that it's Christmas Eve. What are you doing? Where are you?

792
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:09,757
I'm out with my friends.

793

Oh my, why in the world would I think of you, Sunbae?

794
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:20,079
Really, little by little.

795

Do you eat well in the army?

796
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:40,089
I thought this year would be the busiest, but it's the most quiet.

797
00:58:40,089 --> 00:58:46,079
I like it. It's been awhile since I was able to spend time with you like this.

798
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:52,323
Does he not have any plans? Why didn't he go out?

799
00:58:52,323 --> 00:58:58,457
Anyway...Merry Christmas!

800

You're the Sunbae now.

801
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:05,257
I still haven't met a patient.

802
00:59:05,257 --> 00:59:08,157
You already saved someone.

803
00:59:08,157 --> 00:59:12,657
And killed a mannequin.

804
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:17,323
Truthfully, I feel weird.

805
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:22,257
It's really different from practicing on a mannequin.

806
00:59:22,257 --> 00:59:25,523
I didn't get scared.

807
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:30,823
All I could think about was having to save her.

808
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:36,123
I even forgot that I had a date with you.

809
00:59:36,123 --> 00:59:42,529
I had purely wanted to get into the nursing program because of you.

810
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:52,089
It was much more amazing than what I had thought.

811
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:57,079
I'm thinking about reapplying.

812

I'll help you.

It's a cool Christmas.

What?

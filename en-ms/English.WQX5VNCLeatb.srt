00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,041
Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,487
THE PROLOGUE [Enter Chorus.]

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:09,944
CHORUS Two households, both alike in dignity,

4
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:15,816
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:23,087
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

6
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:30,062
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows

7
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:36,300
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,468
And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which but their children's end naught could remove,

9
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:48,675
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which, if you with patient ears attend,

10
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:58,875
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. [Exeunt.]

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:03,123
ACT I. Scene I. A public place.

12
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:07,278
[Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.]

13
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:10,879
SAMPSON Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

14
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,703
GREGORY No, for then we should be colliers.

15
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:16,790
SAMPSON I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,870
GREGORY Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

17
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,006
SAMPSON I strike quickly, being moved.

18
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:24,838
GREGORY But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

19
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:27,886
SAMPSON A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

20
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:31,766
GREGORY To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:

21
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:35,367
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

22
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:42,934
SAMPSON A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

23
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:46,227
GREGORY That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the

24
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:47,326
wall.

25
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:55,169
SAMPSON True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men

26
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,288
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.

27
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:02,048
GREGORY The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

28
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:04,983
SAMPSON 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:

29
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:10,492
when I have fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids, I will cut off their heads.

30
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:12,684
GREGORY The heads of the maids?

31
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:16,524
SAMPSON Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;

32
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,844
take it in what sense thou wilt.

33
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,884
GREGORY They must take it in sense that feel it.

34
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:28,307
SAMPSON Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

35
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:31,316
GREGORY 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst,

36
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:36,164
thou hadst been poor-John.--Draw thy tool; Here comes two of the house of Montagues.

37
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:39,963
SAMPSON My naked weapon is out: quarrel! I will back thee.

38
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:42,443
GREGORY How! turn thy back and run?

39
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:43,955
SAMPSON Fear me not.

40
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,098
GREGORY No, marry; I fear thee!

41
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,338
SAMPSON Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

42
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,346
GREGORY I will frown as I pass by; and let them take it as they list.

43
00:02:53,346 --> 00:03:00,627
SAMPSON Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is

44
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:02,961
disgrace to them if they bear it. [Enter Abraham and Balthasar.]

45
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,102
ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

46
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,534
SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir.

47
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:11,214
ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

48
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:14,092
SAMPSON Is the law of our side if I say ay?

49
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,182
GREGORY No.

50
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:19,181
SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my

51
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,630
thumb, sir.

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,093
GREGORY Do you quarrel, sir?

53
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:25,308
ABRAHAM Quarrel, sir! no, sir.

54
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:29,285
SAMPSON But if you do, sir, am for you: I serve as good a man as

55
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:30,125
you.

56
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,188
ABRAHAM No better.

57
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:32,476
SAMPSON Well, sir.

58
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:35,237
GREGORY Say better; here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

59
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:36,964
SAMPSON Yes, better, sir.

60
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,789
ABRAHAM You lie.

61
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,844
SAMPSON Draw, if you be men.--Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

62
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,081
[They fight.] [Enter Benvolio.]

63
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:49,921
BENVOLIO Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.

64
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,144
[Beats down their swords.] [Enter Tybalt.]

65
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:57,617
TYBALT What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?

66
00:03:57,617 --> 00:04:01,098
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.

67
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:07,308
BENVOLIO I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.

68
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:11,493
TYBALT What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word

69
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:16,523
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: Have at thee, coward!

70
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:21,355
[They fight.] [Enter several of both Houses, who join the fray; then enter

71
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:22,925
Citizens with clubs.]

72
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:31,411
1 CITIZEN Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

73
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:34,810
[Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.]

74
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,619
CAPULET What noise is this?--Give me my long sword, ho!

75
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:41,995
LADY CAPULET A crutch, a crutch!--Why call you for a sword?

76
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:45,490
CAPULET My sword, I say!--Old Montague is come,

77
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,138
And flourishes his blade in spite of me. [Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.]

78
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:54,554
MONTAGUE Thou villain Capulet!-- Hold me not, let me go.

79
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:57,584
LADY MONTAGUE Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

80
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,928
[Enter Prince, with Attendants.]

81
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:07,350
PRINCE Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--

82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:16,758
Will they not hear?--What, ho! you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage

83
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:24,174
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,-- On pain of torture, from those bloody hands

84
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:31,386
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground And hear the sentence of your moved prince.--

85
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:40,725
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,

86
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:46,629
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets; And made Verona's ancient citizens

87
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:53,989
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old,

88
00:05:53,989 --> 00:06:02,141
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate: If ever you disturb our streets again,

89
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:11,467
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time, all the rest depart away:--

90
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:18,755
You, Capulet, shall go along with me;-- And, Montague, come you this afternoon,

91
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:27,204
To know our farther pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.--

92
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:37,626
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. [Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,

93
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,026
Citizens, and Servants.]

94
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,274
MONTAGUE Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?--

95
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,723
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

96
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:49,617
BENVOLIO Here were the servants of your adversary And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:

97
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:55,786
I drew to part them: in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;

98
00:06:55,786 --> 00:07:00,865
Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, He swung about his head, and cut the winds,

99
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:06,649
Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,

100
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:13,096
Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part.

101
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:16,073
LADY MONTAGUE O, where is Romeo?--saw you him to-day?--

102
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:19,185
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

103
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:25,111
BENVOLIO Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,

104
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:31,728
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where,--underneath the grove of sycamore

105
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:37,311
That westward rooteth from the city's side,-- So early walking did I see your son:

106
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:42,950
Towards him I made; but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood:

107
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,878
I, measuring his affections by my own,-- That most are busied when they're most alone,--

108
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:54,846
Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

109
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,125
MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen,

110
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:04,429
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:

111
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:10,845
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw

112
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:17,101
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,

113
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:24,018
And private in his chamber pens himself; Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out

114
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:30,442
And makes himself an artificial night: Black and portentous must this humour prove,

115
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:33,675
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

116
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,410
BENVOLIO My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

117
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,874
MONTAGUE I neither know it nor can learn of him.

118
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:40,090
BENVOLIO Have you importun'd him by any means?

119
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,666
MONTAGUE Both by myself and many other friends;

120
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:49,089
But he, his own affections' counsellor, Is to himself,--I will not say how true,--

121
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,840
But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery,

122
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,024
As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,

123
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:05,800
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
We would as willingly give cure as know.

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,392
BENVOLIO See, where he comes: so please you step aside; I'll know his grievance or be much denied.

126
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:17,784
MONTAGUE I would thou wert so happy by thy stay

127
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:23,574
To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away, [Exeunt Montague and Lady.]

128
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:25,078
[Enter Romeo.]

129
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:26,165
BENVOLIO Good morrow, cousin.

130
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,078
ROMEO Is the day so young?

131
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,165
BENVOLIO But new struck nine.

132
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:34,013
ROMEO Ay me! sad hours seem long.

133
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:38,045
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

134
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:42,692
BENVOLIO It was.--What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

135
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:47,269
ROMEO Not having that which, having, makes them short.

136
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,395
BENVOLIO In love?

137
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:49,612
ROMEO Out,--

138
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:50,709
BENVOLIO Of love?

139
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,844
ROMEO Out of her favour where I am in love.

140
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,340
BENVOLIO Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,

141
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,724
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

142
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,443
ROMEO Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,

143
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:10,035
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!-- Where shall we dine?--O me!--What fray was here?

144
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:15,387
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:--

145
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:22,170
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O anything, of nothing first create!

146
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,393
O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

147
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:37,217
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!--

148
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:45,169
This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh?

149
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,097
BENVOLIO No, coz, I rather weep.

150
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,161
ROMEO Good heart, at what?

151
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,304
BENVOLIO At thy good heart's oppression.

152
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:53,866
ROMEO Why, such is love's transgression.--

153
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:59,528
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast; Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest

154
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:05,927
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.

155
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:14,800
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;

156
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:23,280
Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: What is it else? a madness most discreet,

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,591
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.-- Farewell, my coz.

158
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,920
[Going.]

159
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,648
BENVOLIO Soft! I will go along: An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

160
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:37,550
ROMEO Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:

161
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,991
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

162
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,718
BENVOLIO Tell me in sadness who is that you love?

163
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:46,893
ROMEO What, shall I groan and tell thee?

164
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:49,038
BENVOLIO Groan! why, no;

165
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,134
But sadly tell me who.

166
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:54,317
ROMEO Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,--

167
00:11:54,317 --> 00:12:03,701
Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!-- In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

168
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,509
BENVOLIO I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.

169
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,253
ROMEO A right good markman!--And she's fair I love.

170
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:13,205
BENVOLIO A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

171
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:16,085
ROMEO Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit

172
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:21,580
With Cupid's arrow,--she hath Dian's wit; And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,

173
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:29,387
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. She will not stay the siege of loving terms

174
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:35,011
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:

175
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:42,459
O, she's rich in beauty; only poor That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

176
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,075
BENVOLIO Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

177
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:50,402
ROMEO She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;

178
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:55,898
For beauty, starv'd with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.

179
00:12:55,898 --> 00:13:04,043
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair:

180
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:10,753
She hath forsworn to love; and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

181
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:14,042
BENVOLIO Be rul'd by me, forget to think of her.

182
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,482
ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think.

183
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:20,296
BENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes;

184
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:22,298
Examine other beauties.

185
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:27,577
ROMEO 'Tis the way To call hers, exquisite, in question more:

186
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:36,296
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;

187
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:42,497
He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:

188
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:49,071
Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve but as a note

189
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:58,191
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair? Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

190
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:01,669
BENVOLIO I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

191
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,108
[Exeunt.]

192
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:09,243
Scene II. A Street. [Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servant.]

193
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:12,258
CAPULET But Montague is bound as well as I,

194
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:18,475
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace.

195
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,523
PARIS Of honourable reckoning are you both;

196
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:28,690
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long. But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

197
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,362
CAPULET But saying o'er what I have said before:

198
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:38,146
My child is yet a stranger in the world, She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;

199
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:44,394
Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

200
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:47,785
PARIS Younger than she are happy mothers made.

201
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:51,505
CAPULET And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

202
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:59,233
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,-- She is the hopeful lady of my earth:

203
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:06,711
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part;

204
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:13,536
An she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice.

205
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:20,311
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest,

206
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:26,551
Such as I love; and you among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more.

207
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:33,278
At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:

208
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:39,038
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well apparell'd April on the heel

209
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:45,471
Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night

210
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:52,854
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be:

211
00:15:52,854 --> 00:16:00,717
Which, among view of many, mine, being one, May stand in number, though in reckoning none.

212
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:08,532
Come, go with me.--Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona; find those persons out

213
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:17,175
Whose names are written there, [gives a paper] and to them say, My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

214
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:19,532
[Exeunt Capulet and Paris].

215
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:25,506
SERVANT Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with

216
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:32,323
his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am

217
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:38,914
sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person

218
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:45,641
hath here writ. I must to the learned:--in good time! [Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]

219
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:50,082
BENVOLIO Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,

220
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:57,529
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;

221
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:05,357
One desperate grief cures with another's languish: Take thou some new infection to thy eye,

222
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,901
And the rank poison of the old will die.

223
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,237
ROMEO Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.

224
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:12,813
BENVOLIO For what, I pray thee?

225
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:14,197
ROMEO For your broken shin.

226
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,147
BENVOLIO Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

227
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:19,932
ROMEO Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;

228
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:25,933
Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

229
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:29,757
SERVANT God gi' go-den.--I pray, sir, can you read?

230
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,180
ROMEO Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

231
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,748
SERVANT Perhaps you have learned it without book:

232
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,562
but I pray, can you read anything you see?

233
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:40,459
ROMEO Ay, If I know the letters and the language.

234
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,597
SERVANT Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

235
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:50,299
ROMEO Stay, fellow; I can read. [Reads.] 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;

236
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:58,386
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio and

237
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:03,882
his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and

238
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:09,650
daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the

239
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,712
lively Helena.' A fair assembly. [Gives back the paper]: whither should they

240
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:15,465
come?

241
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:16,145
SERVANT Up.

242
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:16,770
ROMEO Whither?

243
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,577
SERVANT To supper; to our house.

244
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:19,618
ROMEO Whose house?

245
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:20,745
SERVANT My master's.

246
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,953
ROMEO Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.

247
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:26,633
SERVANT Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the great

248
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:35,568
rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!

249
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:36,369
[Exit.]

250
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:42,895
BENVOLIO At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;

251
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:48,833
With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,

252
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:55,317
Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

253
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,437
ROMEO When the devout religion of mine eye

254
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:05,469
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; And these,--who, often drown'd, could never die,--

255
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:13,901
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! One fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun

256
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,773
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

257
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:24,860
BENVOLIO Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself pois'd with herself in either eye:

258
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,931
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd Your lady's love against some other maid

259
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:37,475
That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

260
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:40,407
ROMEO I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

261
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:45,022
But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.]

262
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:51,694
Scene III. Room in Capulet's House. [Enter Lady Capulet, and Nurse.]

263
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,845
LADY CAPULET Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

264
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:59,070
NURSE Now, by my maidenhea,--at twelve year old,--

265
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:08,245
I bade her come.--What, lamb! what ladybird!-- God forbid!--where's this girl?--what, Juliet!

266
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:09,956
[Enter Juliet.]

267
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:11,989
JULIET How now, who calls?

268
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,285
NURSE Your mother.

269
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:15,604
JULIET Madam, I am here. What is your will?

270
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,780
LADY CAPULET This is the matter,--Nurse, give leave awhile,

271
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,276
We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.

272
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:26,939
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

273
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:29,900
NURSE Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

274
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,555
LADY CAPULET She's not fourteen.

275
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:34,119
NURSE I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--

276
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:42,686
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,-- She is not fourteen. How long is it now

277
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:43,910
To Lammas-tide?

278
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,734
LADY CAPULET A fortnight and odd days.

279
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:48,158
NURSE Even or odd, of all days in the year,

280
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:56,818
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she,--God rest all Christian souls!--

281
00:20:56,818 --> 00:21:05,595
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me:--but, as I said,

282
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:12,450
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well.

283
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:18,626
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it--,

284
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:24,473
Of all the days of the year, upon that day: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,

285
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:29,584
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua:

286
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:35,760
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple

287
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,693
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!

288
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:47,141
Shake, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.

289
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:54,211
And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood

290
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:59,146
She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before, she broke her brow:

291
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:05,241
And then my husband,--God be with his soul! 'A was a merry man,--took up the child:

292
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:12,145
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;

293
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:20,023
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay:'

294
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:26,390
To see now how a jest shall come about! I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,

295
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:34,806
I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'

296
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:38,174
LADY CAPULET Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.

297
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:41,949
NURSE Yes, madam;--yet I cannot choose but laugh,

298
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:47,766
To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay:' And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow

299
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:53,674
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.

300
00:22:53,674 --> 00:23:01,130
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;

301
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,865
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted, and said 'Ay.'

302
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:09,629
JULIET And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

303
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,309
NURSE Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!

304
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:18,429
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd: An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.

305
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,294
LADY CAPULET Marry, that marry is the very theme

306
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:26,568
I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?

307
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:29,127
JULIET It is an honour that I dream not of.

308
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:33,096
NURSE An honour!--were not I thine only nurse,

309
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:36,783
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

310
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:40,728
LADY CAPULET Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,

311
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:45,415
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers: by my count

312
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:50,583
I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;--

313
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,974
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

314
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,014
NURSE A man, young lady! lady, such a man

315
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:01,271
As all the world--why he's a man of wax.

316
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:04,022
LADY CAPULET Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

317
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:07,998
NURSE Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.

318
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,926
LADY CAPULET What say you? can you love the gentleman?

319
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:16,613
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,

320
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:22,237
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; Examine every married lineament,

321
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:27,661
And see how one another lends content; And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies

322
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:33,933
Find written in the margent of his eyes. This precious book of love, this unbound lover,

323
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:39,508
To beautify him, only lacks a cover: The fish lives in the sea; and 'tis much pride

324
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:45,748
For fair without the fair within to hide: That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,

325
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:52,083
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; So shall you share all that he doth possess,

326
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,684
By having him, making yourself no less.

327
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:59,700
NURSE No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men

328
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,356
LADY CAPULET Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

329
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:10,034
JULIET I'll look to like, if looking liking move: But no more deep will I endart mine eye

330
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:14,314
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. [Enter a Servant.]

331
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:17,561
SERVANT Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you

332
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:25,042
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must

333
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:28,402
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

334
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,177
LADY CAPULET We follow thee. [Exit Servant.]--

335
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:33,059
Juliet, the county stays.

336
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:38,250
NURSE Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. [Exeunt.]

337
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:45,953
Scene IV. A Street. [Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;

338
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:48,432
Torch-bearers, and others.]

339
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:53,448
ROMEO What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? Or shall we on without apology?

340
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:56,215
BENVOLIO The date is out of such prolixity:

341
00:25:56,215 --> 00:26:01,767
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,

342
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:06,752
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke

343
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:11,478
After the prompter, for our entrance: But, let them measure us by what they will,

344
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:14,551
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

345
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:17,022
ROMEO Give me a torch,--I am not for this ambling;

346
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:20,087
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

347
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:23,856
MERCUTIO Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

348
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:31,934
ROMEO Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes, With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead

349
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:34,806
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

350
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:42,246
MERCUTIO You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.

351
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:46,133
ROMEO I am too sore enpierced with his shaft

352
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:52,165
To soar with his light feathers; and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:

353
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:55,589
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

354
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:04,068
MERCUTIO And, to sink in it, should you burden love; Too great oppression for a tender thing.

355
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:08,372
ROMEO Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,

356
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,180
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.

357
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,891
MERCUTIO If love be rough with you, be rough with love;

358
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:26,178
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.-- Give me a case to put my visage in: [Putting on a mask.]

359
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:32,107
A visard for a visard! what care I What curious eye doth quote deformities?

360
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:35,298
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.

361
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,315
BENVOLIO Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in

362
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:39,500
But every man betake him to his legs.

363
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,354
ROMEO A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart, Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;

364
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:52,097
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,-- I'll be a candle-holder and look on,--

365
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:55,843
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

366
00:27:55,843 --> 00:28:03,825
MERCUTIO Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word: If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire

367
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:12,000
Of this--sir-reverence--love, wherein thou stick'st Up to the ears.--Come, we burn daylight, ho.

368
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,168
ROMEO Nay, that's not so.

369
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:17,025
MERCUTIO I mean, sir, in delay

370
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:24,176
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits

371
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:27,737
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

372
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:32,055
ROMEO And we mean well, in going to this mask; But 'tis no wit to go.

373
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:33,657
MERCUTIO Why, may one ask?

374
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:35,887
ROMEO I dreamt a dream to-night.

375
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:37,759
MERCUTIO And so did I.

376
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,832
ROMEO Well, what was yours?

377
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:42,456
MERCUTIO That dreamers often lie.

378
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:45,527
ROMEO In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

379
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:49,778
MERCUTIO O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

380
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:56,368
She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone

381
00:28:56,368 --> 00:29:01,337
On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies

382
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:07,919
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;

383
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,024
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; The traces, of the smallest spider's web;

384
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:22,432
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams; Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;

385
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:29,830
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm

386
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:36,231
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid: Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,

387
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:42,695
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.

388
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:52,917
And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;

389
00:29:52,917 --> 00:30:02,157
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;

390
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:10,722
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,-- Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,

391
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:17,602
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,

392
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:24,946
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,

393
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:31,257
Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep, Then dreams he of another benefice:

394
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:37,578
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

395
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:44,984
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon

396
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:53,216
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,

397
00:30:53,216 --> 00:31:01,224
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night;

398
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:08,520
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:

399
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:16,600
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them, and learns them first to bear,

400
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,423
Making them women of good carriage: This is she,--

401
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:25,294
ROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,

402
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:27,583
Thou talk'st of nothing.

403
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:34,541
MERCUTIO True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain,

404
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:40,765
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; Which is as thin of substance as the air,

405
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:47,149
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north,

406
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:53,141
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

407
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:56,149
BENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:

408
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:59,229
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

409
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:02,932
ROMEO I fear, too early: for my mind misgives

410
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:08,469
Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, Shall bitterly begin his fearful date

411
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:14,492
With this night's revels; and expire the term Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,

412
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:21,421
By some vile forfeit of untimely death: But He that hath the steerage of my course

413
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:26,798
Direct my sail!--On, lusty gentlemen!

414
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,282
BENVOLIO Strike, drum. [Exeunt.]

415
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:36,585
Scene V. A Hall in Capulet's House. [Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.]

416
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:40,329
1 SERVANT Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?

417
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:43,297
he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!

418
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:49,800
2 SERVANT When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.

419
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,697
1 SERVANT Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look

420
00:32:53,697 --> 00:33:01,912
to the plate:--good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.--

421
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,855
Antony! and Potpan!

422
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:05,328
2 SERVANT Ay, boy, ready.

423
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:08,880
1 SERVANT You are looked for and called for, asked for

424
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,657
and sought for in the great chamber.

425
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:17,744
2 SERVANT We cannot be here and there too.--Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

426
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:23,926
[They retire behind.] [Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests the Maskers.]

427
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:27,879
CAPULET Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes

428
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:35,054
Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.-- Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all

429
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:42,663
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she, I'll swear hath corns; am I come near you now?

430
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:49,918
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day That I have worn a visard; and could tell

431
00:33:49,918 --> 00:33:57,765
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, Such as would please;--'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:

432
00:33:57,765 --> 00:34:04,877
You are welcome, gentlemen!--Come, musicians, play. A hall--a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.--

433
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:11,086
[Music plays, and they dance.] More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,

434
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:20,108
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.-- Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.

435
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:27,931
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; For you and I are past our dancing days;

436
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:32,268
How long is't now since last yourself and I Were in a mask?

437
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:35,060
2 CAPULET By'r Lady, thirty years.

438
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,163
CAPULET What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:

439
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:46,571
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,

440
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:50,395
Some five-and-twenty years; and then we mask'd.

441
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:58,426
2 CAPULET 'Tis more, 'tis more: his son is elder, sir; His son is thirty.

442
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:00,265
CAPULET Will you tell me that?

443
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,618
His son was but a ward two years ago.

444
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:09,137
ROMEO What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight?

445
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:10,577
SERVANT I know not, sir.

446
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:14,569
ROMEO O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

447
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:21,088
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;

448
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:31,072
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows

449
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:37,776
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand

450
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:49,631
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!

451
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:54,856
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

452
00:35:54,856 --> 00:36:01,791
TYBALT This, by his voice, should be a Montague.-- Fetch me my rapier, boy:--what, dares the slave

453
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:07,247
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

454
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:13,054
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

455
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:17,374
CAPULET Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

456
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:20,694
TYBALT Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;

457
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:26,085
A villain, that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night.

458
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:27,950
CAPULET Young Romeo, is it?

459
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,676
TYBALT 'Tis he, that villain, Romeo.

460
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:35,253
CAPULET Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,

461
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:41,124
He bears him like a portly gentleman; And, to say truth, Verona brags of him

462
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:46,340
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: I would not for the wealth of all the town

463
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:52,188
Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him,--

464
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:59,620
It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,

465
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,573
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

466
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:06,756
TYBALT It fits, when such a villain is a guest: I'll not endure him.

467
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:09,915
CAPULET He shall be endur'd:

468
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:18,787
What, goodman boy!--I say he shall;--go to; Am I the master here, or you? go to.

469
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:25,074
You'll not endure him!--God shall mend my soul, You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

470
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:27,851
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

471
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:30,001
TYBALT Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

472
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,995
CAPULET Go to, go to!

473
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:39,018
You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?-- This trick may chance to scathe you,--I know what:

474
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:45,786
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.-- Well said, my hearts!--You are a princox; go:

475
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:54,578
Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--For shame! I'll make you quiet. What!--cheerly, my hearts.

476
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:58,049
TYBALT Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting

477
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:04,936
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,

478
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:09,848
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall. [Exit.]

479
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:13,887
ROMEO [To Juliet.] If I profane with my unworthiest hand

480
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:23,374
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this,-- My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

481
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:27,145
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

482
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:33,392
JULIET Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

483
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:40,527
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

484
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,350
ROMEO Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

485
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,471
JULIET Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

486
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:52,169
ROMEO O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;

487
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:57,704
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

488
00:38:57,704 --> 00:39:01,415
JULIET Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

489
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:08,679
ROMEO Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.

490
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,286
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. [Kissing her.]

491
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:12,751
JULIET Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

492
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:17,767
ROMEO Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!

493
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,885
Give me my sin again.

494
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,911
JULIET You kiss by the book.

495
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:24,221
NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

496
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,623
ROMEO What is her mother?

497
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:27,086
NURSE Marry, bachelor,

498
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:32,614
Her mother is the lady of the house. And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:

499
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:38,172
I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal; I tell you, he that can lay hold of her

500
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,021
Shall have the chinks. ROMEO

501
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:46,541
Is she a Capulet? O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

502
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,501
BENVOLIO Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

503
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:54,571
ROMEO Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

504
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:57,643
CAPULET Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;

505
00:39:57,643 --> 00:40:06,234
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.-- Is it e'en so? why then, I thank you all;

506
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:14,114
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night.-- More torches here!--Come on then, let's to bed.

507
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:21,506
Ah, sirrah [to 2 Capulet], by my fay, it waxes late; I'll to my rest.

508
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:24,937
[Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.]

509
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:28,601
JULIET Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

510
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:30,977
NURSE The son and heir of old Tiberio.

511
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:33,376
JULIET What's he that now is going out of door?

512
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:36,872
NURSE Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

513
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:40,672
JULIET What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

514
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,296
NURSE I know not.

515
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:45,440
JULIET Go ask his name: if he be married,

516
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,777
My grave is like to be my wedding-bed. NURSE

517
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:53,264
His name is Romeo, and a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.

518
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:56,712
JULIET My only love sprung from my only hate!

519
00:40:56,712 --> 00:41:03,407
Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me,

520
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:05,648
That I must love a loathed enemy. NURSE

521
00:41:05,648 --> 00:41:07,663
What's this? What's this? JULIET

522
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:12,183
A rhyme I learn'd even now Of one I danc'd withal.

523
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:15,719
[One calls within, 'Juliet.'] NURSE

524
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,614
Anon, anon! Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

525
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:23,326
[Exeunt.] [Enter Chorus.]

526
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:27,310
CHORUS Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,

527
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:34,197
And young affection gapes to be his heir; That fair for which love groan'd for, and would die,

528
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:41,716
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair. Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,

529
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:48,413
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks; But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,

530
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:56,708
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: Being held a foe, he may not have access

531
00:41:56,708 --> 00:42:03,916
To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less

532
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:10,092
To meet her new beloved anywhere: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,

533
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:19,850
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet. [Exit.]

ROMEO AND JULIET by William Shakespeare

536
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:30,799
ACT II. Scene I. An open place adjoining Capulet's Garden.

537
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,218
[Enter Romeo.]

538
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:38,534
ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

539
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:45,319
[He climbs the wall and leaps down within it.] [Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]

540
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,983
BENVOLIO Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

541
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,646
MERCUTIO He is wise;

542
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:52,853
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.

543
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:57,150
BENVOLIO He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: Call, good Mercutio.

544
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,301
MERCUTIO Nay, I'll conjure too.--

545
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:08,480
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:

546
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:17,092
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied; Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but Love and dove;

547
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:23,932
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir,

548
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:29,956
Young auburn Cupid, he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!--

549
00:43:29,956 --> 00:43:36,884
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--

550
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:44,396
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,

551
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:54,075
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,

552
00:43:54,075 --> 00:43:57,328
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

553
00:43:57,328 --> 00:43:59,800
BENVOLIO An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

554
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,906
MERCUTIO This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,

555
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:13,161
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;

556
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:21,034
That were some spite: my invocation Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress' name,

557
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:24,706
I conjure only but to raise up him.

558
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:28,922
BENVOLIO Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, To be consorted with the humorous night:

559
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:32,208
Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.

560
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:36,480
MERCUTIO If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.

561
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,575
Now will he sit under a medlar tree, And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit

562
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:51,791
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.-- Romeo, good night.--I'll to my truckle-bed;

563
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:56,711
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep: Come, shall we go?

564
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:58,879
BENVOLIO Go then; for 'tis in vain

565
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:02,388
To seek him here that means not to be found. [Exeunt.]

00:45:07,516 --> 00:45:11,820
ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound.--

568
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:19,636
[Juliet appears above at a window.] But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?

569
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:28,804
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!-- Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

570
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:35,941
Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she:

571
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:42,995
Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green,

572
00:45:42,995 --> 00:45:51,355
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.-- It is my lady; O, it is my love!

573
00:45:51,355 --> 00:46:00,210
O, that she knew she were!-- She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?

574
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:10,587
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.-- I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:

575
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:17,259
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes

576
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:24,504
To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head?

577
00:46:24,504 --> 00:46:32,744
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven

578
00:46:32,744 --> 00:46:39,680
Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.--

579
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:48,384
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! O that I were a glove upon that hand,

580
00:46:48,384 --> 00:46:50,382
That I might touch that cheek!

581
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:51,567
JULIET Ah me!

582
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:52,694
ROMEO She speaks:--

583
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:58,238
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,

584
00:46:58,238 --> 00:47:03,022
As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes

585
00:47:03,022 --> 00:47:08,528
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds

586
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:11,416
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

587
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:19,829
JULIET O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name;

588
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:26,434
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

589
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:29,839
ROMEO [Aside.] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

590
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,309
JULIET 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;--

591
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:40,248
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,

592
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:47,448
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!

593
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:54,118
What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet;

594
00:47:54,118 --> 00:48:01,822
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes

595
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:08,950
Without that title:--Romeo, doff thy name; And for that name, which is no part of thee,

596
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,795
Take all myself.

597
00:48:10,795 --> 00:48:15,213
ROMEO I take thee at thy word: Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;

598
00:48:15,213 --> 00:48:17,746
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

599
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:22,756
JULIET What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night, So stumblest on my counsel?

600
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:24,060
ROMEO By a name

601
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,877
I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,

602
00:48:29,877 --> 00:48:34,356
Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word.

603
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:37,595
JULIET My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words

604
00:48:37,595 --> 00:48:43,587
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound; Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

605
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,651
ROMEO Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

606
00:48:46,651 --> 00:48:49,747
JULIET How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?

607
00:48:49,747 --> 00:48:55,115
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb; And the place death, considering who thou art,

608
00:48:55,115 --> 00:48:57,320
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

609
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:03,282
ROMEO With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out:

610
00:49:03,282 --> 00:49:09,994
And what love can do, that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

611
00:49:09,994 --> 00:49:12,418
JULIET If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

612
00:49:12,418 --> 00:49:15,353
ROMEO Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye

613
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:20,834
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.

614
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:23,122
JULIET I would not for the world they saw thee here.

615
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:25,858
ROMEO I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;

616
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:31,472
And, but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate

617
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:33,809
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

618
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:36,385
JULIET By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

619
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:39,785
ROMEO By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;

620
00:49:39,785 --> 00:49:47,152
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far

621
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:53,679
As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise.

622
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:56,087
JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;

623
00:49:56,087 --> 00:50:01,175
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.

624
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:10,618
Fain would I dwell on form,fain, fain deny What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!

625
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:19,361
Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say Ay; And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,

626
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:26,500
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries, They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,

627
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:33,004
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,

628
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:41,033
I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo: but else, not for the world.

629
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:48,259
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond; And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:

630
00:50:48,259 --> 00:50:53,505
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange.

631
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:59,640
I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,

632
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,713
My true-love passion: therefore pardon me; And not impute this yielding to light love,

633
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:07,953
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

634
00:51:07,953 --> 00:51:11,609
ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,

635
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:15,902
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,--

636
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:21,945
JULIET O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb,

637
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:25,240
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

638
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,337
ROMEO What shall I swear by?

639
00:51:26,337 --> 00:51:27,850
JULIET Do not swear at all;

640
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:35,207
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry,

641
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,328
And I'll believe thee.

642
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:39,243
ROMEO If my heart's dear love,--

643
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:42,088
JULIET Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,

644
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:48,095
I have no joy of this contract to-night; It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;

645
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:54,351
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night!

646
00:51:54,351 --> 00:52:00,231
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.

647
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:08,190
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

648
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,870
ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

649
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,318
JULIET What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

650
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,973
ROMEO The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

651
00:52:17,973 --> 00:52:20,469
JULIET I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;

652
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:23,556
And yet I would it were to give again.

653
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:27,181
ROMEO Would'st thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

654
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:29,861
JULIET But to be frank and give it thee again.

655
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:36,203
And yet I wish but for the thing I have; My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

656
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:42,468
My love as deep; the more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite.

657
00:52:42,468 --> 00:52:46,795
I hear some noise within: dear love, adieu!-- [Nurse calls within.]

658
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:52,387
Anon, good nurse!--Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little, I will come again.

659
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:53,118
[Exit.]

660
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:58,676
ROMEO O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream,

661
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:03,080
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. [Enter Juliet above.]

662
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,504
JULIET Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.

663
00:53:05,504 --> 00:53:10,465
If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,

664
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:14,632
By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;

665
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:20,016
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.

666
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:22,039
NURSE [Within.] Madam!

667
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,239
JULIET I come anon.-- But if thou meanest not well,

668
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,394
I do beseech thee,--

669
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:28,250
NURSE [Within.] Madam!

670
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,249
JULIET By-and-by I come:--

671
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:34,380
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.

672
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,521
ROMEO So thrive my soul,--

673
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,601
JULIET A thousand times good night!

674
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:39,415
[Exit.]

675
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:47,488
ROMEO A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!-- Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;

676
00:53:47,488 --> 00:53:55,721
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. [Retiring slowly.]

677
00:53:55,721 --> 00:53:57,649
[Re-enter Juliet, above.]

678
00:53:57,649 --> 00:54:01,468
JULIET Hist! Romeo, hist!--O for a falconer's voice

679
00:54:01,468 --> 00:54:05,880
To lure this tassel-gentle back again! Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;

680
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,687
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine

681
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,151
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

682
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:15,367
ROMEO It is my soul that calls upon my name:

683
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:21,575
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!

684
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:22,398
JULIET Romeo!

685
00:54:22,398 --> 00:54:23,078
ROMEO My dear?

686
00:54:23,078 --> 00:54:24,272
JULIET At what o'clock to-morrow

687
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:25,173
Shall I send to thee?

688
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:26,092
ROMEO At the hour of nine.

689
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:32,712
JULIET I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back.

690
00:54:32,712 --> 00:54:35,799
ROMEO Let me stand here till thou remember it.

691
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:38,791
JULIET I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,

692
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:41,148
Remembering how I love thy company.

693
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:45,687
ROMEO And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.

694
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:49,055
JULIET 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:

695
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:54,111
And yet no farther than a wanton's bird; That lets it hop a little from her hand,

696
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:59,741
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silk thread plucks it back again,

697
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:02,053
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

698
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:03,685
ROMEO I would I were thy bird.

699
00:55:03,685 --> 00:55:05,214
JULIET Sweet, so would I:

700
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:14,101
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow

701
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:17,887
That I shall say good night till it be morrow. [Exit.]

702
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:22,141
ROMEO Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!--

703
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:29,894
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,

704
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:36,755
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. [Exit.]

705
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:44,698
Scene III. Friar Lawrence's Cell. [Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.]

706
00:55:44,698 --> 00:55:48,001
FRIAR The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,

707
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:55,025
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light; And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels

708
00:55:55,025 --> 00:56:03,893
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye,

709
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:12,925
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must up-fill this osier cage of ours

710
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:20,222
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb;

711
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:28,752
What is her burying gave, that is her womb: And from her womb children of divers kind

712
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:35,627
We sucking on her natural bosom find; Many for many virtues excellent,

713
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:43,027
None but for some, and yet all different. O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies

714
00:56:43,027 --> 00:56:52,551
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: For naught so vile that on the earth doth live

715
00:56:52,551 --> 00:57:02,783
But to the earth some special good doth give; Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,

716
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:11,815
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;

717
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:21,256
And vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this small flower

718
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:31,378
Poison hath residence, and medicine power: For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;

719
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:39,794
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such opposed kings encamp them still

720
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:47,869
In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant,

721
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:53,821
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. [Enter Romeo.]

722
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:55,436
ROMEO Good morrow, father!

723
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:57,021
FRIAR Benedicite!

724
00:57:57,021 --> 00:58:03,899
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?-- Young son, it argues a distemper'd head

725
00:58:03,899 --> 00:58:10,898
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,

726
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:19,150
And where care lodges sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain

727
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:28,121
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure

728
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:36,453
Thou art uprous'd with some distemperature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right,--

729
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:41,186
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

730
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:43,753
ROMEO That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

731
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:48,198
FRIAR God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

732
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:54,313
ROMEO With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

733
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:59,369
FRIAR That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?

734
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,025
ROMEO I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.

735
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:08,704
I have been feasting with mine enemy; Where, on a sudden, one hath wounded me

736
00:59:08,704 --> 00:59:13,472
That's by me wounded. Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies;

737
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:21,761
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.

738
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:25,775
FRIAR Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;

739
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:29,997
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

740
00:59:29,997 --> 00:59:37,031
ROMEO Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:

741
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:43,263
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; And all combin'd, save what thou must combine

742
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:49,254
By holy marriage: when, and where, and how We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,

743
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:55,936
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, That thou consent to marry us to-day.

744
00:59:55,936 --> 01:00:00,097
FRIAR Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here!

745
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:08,600
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken? young men's love, then, lies

746
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:16,341
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine

747
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:23,229
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! How much salt water thrown away in waste,

748
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:30,592
To season love, that of it doth not taste! The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,

749
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:38,429
Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears; Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit

750
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:46,108
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet: If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,

751
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:54,411
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline; And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then,--

752
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:58,299
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

753
01:00:58,299 --> 01:01:01,674
ROMEO Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

754
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:05,236
FRIAR For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

755
01:01:05,236 --> 01:01:06,907
ROMEO And bad'st me bury love.

756
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:08,360
FRIAR Not in a grave

757
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,790
To lay one in, another out to have.

758
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:17,816
ROMEO I pray thee chide not: she whom I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;

759
01:01:17,816 --> 01:01:19,237
The other did not so.

760
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:25,112
FRIAR O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.

761
01:01:25,112 --> 01:01:32,752
But come, young waverer, come go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be;

762
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:39,367
For this alliance may so happy prove, To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

763
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:42,336
ROMEO O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

764
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:47,481
FRIAR Wisely, and slow; they stumble that run fast.

765
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:48,707
[Exeunt.]

766
01:01:48,707 --> 01:01:55,449
Scene IV. A Street. [Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]

767
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:57,622
MERCUTIO Where the devil should this Romeo be?--

768
01:01:57,622 --> 01:02:00,082
Came he not home to-night?

769
01:02:00,082 --> 01:02:02,189
BENVOLIO Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

770
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:07,812
MERCUTIO Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,

771
01:02:07,812 --> 01:02:11,148
Torments him so that he will sure run mad.

772
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:15,901
BENVOLIO Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

773
01:02:15,901 --> 01:02:18,435
MERCUTIO A challenge, on my life.

774
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,131
BENVOLIO Romeo will answer it.

775
01:02:20,131 --> 01:02:23,089
MERCUTIO Any man that can write may answer a letter.

776
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:25,603
BENVOLIO Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he

777
01:02:25,603 --> 01:02:27,436
dares, being dared.

778
01:02:27,436 --> 01:02:32,891
MERCUTIO Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabbed with a white

779
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:45,315
wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft:

780
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:49,207
and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

781
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:51,395
BENVOLIO Why, what is Tybalt?

782
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:56,130
MERCUTIO More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he's the

783
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:07,209
courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song--keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his

784
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:20,072
minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of

785
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:30,496
the very first house,--of the first and second cause: ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay.--

786
01:03:30,496 --> 01:03:31,591
BENVOLIO The what?

787
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:37,719
MERCUTIO The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes; these

788
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:51,152
new tuners of accents!--'By Jesu, a very good blade!--a very tall man!--a very good whore!'--Why, is not this a lamentable thing,

789
01:03:51,152 --> 01:04:02,108
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-moi's, who stand so

790
01:04:02,108 --> 01:04:09,533
much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bons, their bons!

791
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:11,805
BENVOLIO Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!

792
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:18,517
MERCUTIO Without his roe, like a dried herring.--O flesh, flesh, how art

793
01:04:18,517 --> 01:04:28,566
thou fishified!--Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench,--marry, she had

794
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:39,780
a better love to be-rhyme her; Dido, a dowdy; Cleopatra, a gypsy; Helen and Hero, hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a gray eye or so,

795
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,807
but not to the purpose,-- [Enter Romeo.]

796
01:04:43,807 --> 01:04:53,815
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

797
01:04:53,815 --> 01:04:57,814
ROMEO Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

798
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:01,633
MERCUTIO The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

799
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:05,638
ROMEO Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a

800
01:05:05,638 --> 01:05:08,423
case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

801
01:05:08,423 --> 01:05:14,682
MERCUTIO That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.

802
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,497
ROMEO Meaning, to court'sy.

803
01:05:16,497 --> 01:05:18,668
MERCUTIO Thou hast most kindly hit it.

804
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:20,505
ROMEO A most courteous exposition.

805
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:23,873
MERCUTIO Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

806
01:05:23,873 --> 01:05:25,488
ROMEO Pink for flower.

807
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,394
MERCUTIO Right.

808
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,368
ROMEO Why, then is my pump well-flowered.

809
01:05:28,368 --> 01:05:32,992
MERCUTIO Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out

810
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:40,552
thy pump;that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, sole singular.

811
01:05:40,552 --> 01:05:45,191
ROMEO O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!

812
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:49,527
MERCUTIO Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

813
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:53,327
ROMEO Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

814
01:05:53,327 --> 01:05:58,389
MERCUTIO Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done; for

815
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:07,943
thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five: was I with you there for the

816
01:06:07,943 --> 01:06:08,957
goose?

817
01:06:08,957 --> 01:06:13,038
ROMEO Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.

818
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:17,405
MERCUTIO I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

819
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:19,069
ROMEO Nay, good goose, bite not.

820
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:23,554
MERCUTIO Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp

821
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:24,578
sauce.

822
01:06:24,578 --> 01:06:28,050
ROMEO And is it not, then, well served in to a sweet goose?

823
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:33,209
MERCUTIO O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch

824
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:35,319
narrow to an ell broad!

825
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:44,064
ROMEO I stretch it out for that word broad: which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

826
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:51,817
MERCUTIO Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art

827
01:06:51,817 --> 01:07:05,087
thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a

828
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:10,767
great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

829
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:12,343
BENVOLIO Stop there, stop there.

830
01:07:12,343 --> 01:07:15,830
MERCUTIO Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

831
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,070
BENVOLIO Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

832
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:22,711
MERCUTIO O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: for I was

833
01:07:22,711 --> 01:07:28,414
come to the whole depth of my tale; and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.

834
01:07:28,414 --> 01:07:29,533
ROMEO Here's goodly gear!

835
01:07:29,533 --> 01:07:31,740
[Enter Nurse and Peter.]

836
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,764
MERCUTIO A sail, a sail, a sail!

837
01:07:33,764 --> 01:07:35,724
BENVOLIO Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

838
01:07:35,724 --> 01:07:36,879
NURSE Peter!

839
01:07:36,879 --> 01:07:37,693
PETER Anon.

840
01:07:37,693 --> 01:07:38,718
NURSE My fan, Peter.

841
01:07:38,718 --> 01:07:43,878
MERCUTIO Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face.

842
01:07:43,878 --> 01:07:45,654
NURSE God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

843
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:48,494
MERCUTIO God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.

844
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:49,684
NURSE Is it good-den?

845
01:07:49,684 --> 01:07:54,917
MERCUTIO 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is

846
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:57,803
now upon the prick of noon.

847
01:07:57,803 --> 01:08:00,347
NURSE Out upon you! what a man are you!

848
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:04,992
ROMEO One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.

849
01:08:04,992 --> 01:08:14,653
NURSE By my troth, it is well said;--for himself to mar, quoth 'a?--Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young

850
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:15,251
Romeo?

851
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:21,795
ROMEO I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of

852
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:24,274
that name, for fault of a worse.

853
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:25,492
NURSE You say well.

854
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:31,107
MERCUTIO Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely,

855
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,258
wisely.

856
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:35,506
NURSE If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

857
01:08:35,506 --> 01:08:37,419
BENVOLIO She will indite him to some supper.

858
01:08:37,419 --> 01:08:37,627
MERCUTIO A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

859
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:38,708
ROMEO What hast thou found?

860
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:44,203
MERCUTIO No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is

861
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,161
something stale and hoar ere it be spent. [Sings.]

862
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:51,352
An old hare hoar, And an old hare hoar,

863
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:55,646
Is very good meat in Lent; But a hare that is hoar

864
01:08:55,646 --> 01:08:59,968
Is too much for a score When it hoars ere it be spent.

865
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:05,727
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner thither.

866
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:06,855
ROMEO I will follow you.

867
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:09,615
MERCUTIO Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,--

868
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:17,359
[singing] lady, lady, lady. [Exeunt Mercutio, and Benvolio.]

869
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,303
NURSE Marry, farewell!--I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was

870
01:09:21,303 --> 01:09:23,631
this that was so full of his ropery?

871
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:30,929
ROMEO A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk; and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

872
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:34,739
NURSE An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an'a

873
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:43,576
were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his

874
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:51,696
flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates.--And thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!

875
01:09:51,696 --> 01:09:55,791
PETER I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon

876
01:09:55,791 --> 01:10:04,464
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law

877
01:10:04,464 --> 01:10:05,944
on my side.

878
01:10:05,944 --> 01:10:09,025
NURSE Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me

879
01:10:09,025 --> 01:10:19,473
quivers. Scurvy knave!--Pray you, sir, a word: and, as I told you, my young lady bid me enquire you out; what she bade me say I

880
01:10:19,473 --> 01:10:28,109
will keep to myself: but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross

881
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:36,878
kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were

882
01:10:36,878 --> 01:10:41,320
an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

883
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,558
ROMEO Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto

884
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:46,460
thee,--

885
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:51,534
NURSE Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much: Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

886
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:54,974
ROMEO What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

887
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:59,013
NURSE I will tell her, sir,--that you do protest: which, as I

888
01:10:59,013 --> 01:11:00,955
take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

889
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:04,797
ROMEO Bid her devise some means to come to shrift This afternoon;

890
01:11:04,797 --> 01:11:11,133
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

891
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,100
NURSE No, truly, sir; not a penny.

892
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,165
ROMEO Go to; I say you shall.

893
01:11:15,165 --> 01:11:18,046
NURSE This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

894
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:20,590
ROMEO And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey-wall:

895
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:26,365
Within this hour my man shall be with thee, And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;

896
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:31,582
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.

897
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:40,156
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains: Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

898
01:11:40,156 --> 01:11:44,493
NURSE Now God in heaven bless thee!--Hark you, sir.

899
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:46,116
ROMEO What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

900
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:49,220
NURSE Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,

901
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:52,010
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

902
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,773
ROMEO I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

903
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:59,632
NURSE Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady.--Lord, Lord!

904
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:08,440
when 'twas a little prating thing,--O, there's a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good

905
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:17,084
soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but

906
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:26,065
I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not Rosemary and Romeo begin both with

907
01:12:26,065 --> 01:12:26,623
a letter?

908
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,375
ROMEO Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

909
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:37,768
NURSE Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the dog: no; I know it begins with some other letter:--and she hath the

910
01:12:37,768 --> 01:12:43,877
prettiest sententious of it, of you and Rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.

911
01:12:43,877 --> 01:12:45,934
ROMEO Commend me to thy lady.

912
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:49,501
NURSE Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.]--Peter!

913
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:50,437
PETER Anon?

914
01:12:50,437 --> 01:12:52,485
NURSE Peter, take my fan, and go before.

915
01:12:52,485 --> 01:12:53,804
[Exeunt.]

916
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:59,061
Scene V. Capulet's Garden. [Enter Juliet.]

917
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:01,645
JULIET The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;

918
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:08,299
In half an hour she promis'd to return. Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.--

919
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:15,765
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,

920
01:13:15,765 --> 01:13:22,306
Driving back shadows over lowering hills: Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,

921
01:13:22,306 --> 01:13:28,075
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Now is the sun upon the highmost hill

922
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:33,713
Of this day's journey; and from nine till twelve Is three long hours,--yet she is not come.

923
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:39,298
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;

924
01:13:39,298 --> 01:13:42,961
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me:

925
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:52,387
But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.--

926
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:56,665
O God, she comes! [Enter Nurse and Peter].

927
01:13:56,665 --> 01:14:02,025
O honey nurse, what news? Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

928
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:03,898
NURSE Peter, stay at the gate.

929
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:04,984
[Exit Peter.]

930
01:14:04,984 --> 01:14:12,674
JULIET Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad? Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;

931
01:14:12,674 --> 01:14:17,769
If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.

932
01:14:17,769 --> 01:14:21,154
NURSE I am aweary, give me leave awhile;--

933
01:14:21,154 --> 01:14:25,928
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

934
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:34,761
JULIET I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: Nay, come, I pray thee speak;--good, good nurse, speak.

935
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:38,233
NURSE Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?

936
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:41,743
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

937
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:46,498
JULIET How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?

938
01:14:46,498 --> 01:14:51,272
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.

939
01:14:51,272 --> 01:14:57,542
Is thy news good or bad? answer to that; Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:

940
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:00,427
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

941
01:15:00,427 --> 01:15:10,222
NURSE Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than

942
01:15:10,222 --> 01:15:19,329
any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a foot, and a body,--though they be not to be talked on, yet they

943
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:29,192
are past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,--but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb.--Go thy ways, wench; serve God.-

944
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,502
-What, have you dined at home?

945
01:15:31,502 --> 01:15:37,511
JULIET No, no: but all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?

946
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:42,015
NURSE Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!

947
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:51,102
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!--

948
01:15:51,102 --> 01:15:56,777
Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jauncing up and down!

949
01:15:56,777 --> 01:15:59,678
JULIET I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

950
01:15:59,678 --> 01:16:06,442
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

951
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:12,252
NURSE Your love says, like an honest gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome;

952
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:16,459
And, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

953
01:16:16,459 --> 01:16:22,916
JULIET Where is my mother?--why, she is within; Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!

954
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:26,332
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,-- 'Where is your mother?'

955
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,396
NURSE O God's lady dear!

956
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:35,885
Are you so hot? marry,come up, I trow; Is this the poultice for my aching bones?

957
01:16:35,885 --> 01:16:39,308
Henceforward, do your messages yourself.

958
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:44,435
JULIET Here's such a coil!--come, what says Romeo?

959
01:16:44,435 --> 01:16:46,829
NURSE Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

960
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:47,997
JULIET I have.

961
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:51,085
NURSE Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell;

962
01:16:51,085 --> 01:16:57,635
There stays a husband to make you a wife: Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,

963
01:16:57,635 --> 01:17:03,773
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news. Hie you to church; I must another way,

964
01:17:03,773 --> 01:17:08,918
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:

965
01:17:08,918 --> 01:17:16,428
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; But you shall bear the burden soon at night.

966
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:20,681
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

967
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:26,026
JULIET Hie to high fortune!--honest nurse, farewell. [Exeunt.]

968
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:33,488
Scene VI. Friar Lawrence's Cell. [Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]

969
01:17:33,488 --> 01:17:37,370
FRIAR So smile the heavens upon this holy act

970
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,831
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

971
01:17:40,831 --> 01:17:46,105
ROMEO Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy

972
01:17:46,105 --> 01:17:52,281
That one short minute gives me in her sight: Do thou but close our hands with holy words,

973
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:58,456
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,-- It is enough I may but call her mine.

974
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:02,943
FRIAR These violent delights have violent ends,

975
01:18:02,943 --> 01:18:11,088
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume: the sweetest honey

976
01:18:11,088 --> 01:18:17,079
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness, And in the taste confounds the appetite:

977
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:25,605
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

978
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:32,694
Here comes the lady:--O, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:

979
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:38,461
A lover may bestride the gossamer That idles in the wanton summer air

980
01:18:38,461 --> 01:18:44,924
And yet not fall; so light is vanity. [Enter Juliet.]

981
01:18:44,924 --> 01:18:47,381
JULIET Good-even to my ghostly confessor.

982
01:18:47,381 --> 01:18:50,980
FRIAR Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

983
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:54,092
JULIET As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

984
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:57,647
ROMEO Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy

985
01:18:57,647 --> 01:19:04,570
Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath

986
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:10,458
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both

987
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:13,345
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

JULIET Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,

989
01:19:16,645 --> 01:19:21,892
Brags of his substance, not of ornament: They are but beggars that can count their worth;

990
01:19:21,892 --> 01:19:27,963
But my true love is grown to such excess, I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

991
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:32,178
FRIAR Come, come with me, and we will make short work;

992
01:19:32,178 --> 01:19:39,283
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one.

ROMEO AND JULIET by William Shakespeare

996
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:56,875
ACT III. Scene I. A public Place.

997
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:02,113
[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page, and Servants.]

998
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:07,891
BENVOLIO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,

999
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:13,651
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

1000
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:17,571
MERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the

1001
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:26,446
confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second

1002
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:30,916
cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

1003
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:33,368
BENVOLIO Am I like such a fellow?

1004
01:20:33,368 --> 01:20:38,776
MERCUTIO Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in

1005
01:20:38,776 --> 01:20:44,920
Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

1006
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,279
BENVOLIO And what to?

1007
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:51,384
MERCUTIO Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for

1008
01:20:51,384 --> 01:21:01,430
one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou

1009
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:10,878
hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;--what eye but such

1010
01:21:10,878 --> 01:21:20,558
an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been

1011
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:30,230
beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened

1012
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:39,885
thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with

1013
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:47,957
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

1014
01:21:47,957 --> 01:21:50,728
BENVOLIO An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy

1015
01:21:50,728 --> 01:21:53,076
the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

1016
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:56,180
MERCUTIO The fee simple! O simple!

1017
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,235
BENVOLIO By my head, here come the Capulets.

1018
01:21:58,235 --> 01:22:01,195
MERCUTIO By my heel, I care not.

1019
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:03,228
[Enter Tybalt and others.]

1020
01:22:03,228 --> 01:22:08,467
TYBALT Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--Gentlemen, good-den:

1021
01:22:08,467 --> 01:22:09,497
a word with one of you.

1022
01:22:09,497 --> 01:22:17,108
MERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

1023
01:22:17,108 --> 01:22:20,005
TYBALT You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give

1024
01:22:20,005 --> 01:22:20,665
me occasion.

1025
01:22:20,665 --> 01:22:23,743
MERCUTIO Could you not take some occasion without giving?

1026
01:22:23,743 --> 01:22:26,272
TYBALT Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo,--

1027
01:22:26,272 --> 01:22:37,034
MERCUTIO Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my

1028
01:22:37,034 --> 01:22:42,087
fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!

1029
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:46,969
BENVOLIO We talk here in the public haunt of men: Either withdraw unto some private place,

1030
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:52,049
And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

1031
01:22:52,049 --> 01:22:55,833
MERCUTIO Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;

1032
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:58,836
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

1033
01:22:58,836 --> 01:23:04,271
TYBALT Well, peace be with you, sir.--Here comes my man. [Enter Romeo.]

1034
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:08,838
MERCUTIO But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:

1035
01:23:08,838 --> 01:23:17,941
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; Your worship in that sense may call him man.

1036
01:23:17,941 --> 01:23:21,716
TYBALT Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford

1037
01:23:21,716 --> 01:23:25,170
No better term than this,--Thou art a villain.

1038
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:30,997
ROMEO Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage

1039
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:38,009
To such a greeting. Villain am I none; Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

1040
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:41,542
TYBALT Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries

1041
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:44,201
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

1042
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:50,803
ROMEO I do protest I never injur'd thee; But love thee better than thou canst devise

1043
01:23:50,803 --> 01:23:57,739
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love: And so good Capulet,--which name I tender

1044
01:23:57,739 --> 01:24:01,262
As dearly as mine own,--be satisfied.

1045
01:24:01,262 --> 01:24:11,075
MERCUTIO O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! Alla stoccata carries it away. [Draws.]

1046
01:24:11,075 --> 01:24:15,334
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

1047
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:17,851
TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me?

1048
01:24:17,851 --> 01:24:24,426
MERCUTIO Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I

1049
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:33,601
mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of

1050
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:38,793
his pitcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

1051
01:24:38,793 --> 01:24:42,162
TYBALT I am for you. [Drawing.]

1052
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:45,736
ROMEO Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

1053
01:24:45,736 --> 01:24:48,657
MERCUTIO Come, sir, your passado.

1054
01:24:48,657 --> 01:24:49,654
[They fight.]

1055
01:24:49,654 --> 01:24:55,763
ROMEO Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.-- Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!--

1056
01:24:55,763 --> 01:25:02,600
Tybalt,--Mercutio,--the prince expressly hath Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.--

1057
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:09,824
Hold, Tybalt!--good Mercutio!-- [Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans.]

1058
01:25:09,824 --> 01:25:16,647
MERCUTIO I am hurt;--

1059
01:25:16,647 --> 01:25:27,507
A plague o' both your houses!--I am sped.-- Is he gone, and hath nothing?

1060
01:25:27,507 --> 01:25:28,882
BENVOLIO What, art thou hurt?

1061
01:25:28,882 --> 01:25:34,201
MERCUTIO Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.--

1062
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:40,719
Where is my page?--go, villain, fetch a surgeon. [Exit Page.]

1063
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,175
ROMEO Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

1064
01:25:45,175 --> 01:25:51,773
MERCUTIO No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;

1065
01:25:51,773 --> 01:26:10,530
but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this

1066
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:26,188
world.--A plague o' both your houses!--Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a

1067
01:26:26,188 --> 01:26:36,867
villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!--Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.

1068
01:26:36,867 --> 01:26:39,491
ROMEO I thought all for the best.

1069
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:43,131
MERCUTIO Help me into some house, Benvolio,

1070
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:51,884
Or I shall faint.--A plague o' both your houses! They have made worms' meat of me:

1071
01:26:51,884 --> 01:27:01,461
I have it, and soundly too.--Your houses! [Exit Mercutio and Benvolio.]

1072
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:04,699
ROMEO This gentleman, the prince's near ally,

1073
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:11,411
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf; my reputation stain'd

1074
01:27:11,411 --> 01:27:22,915
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my kinsman.--O sweet Juliet,

1075
01:27:22,915 --> 01:27:30,195
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper soften'd valour's steel.

1076
01:27:30,195 --> 01:27:31,702
[Re-enter Benvolio.]

1077
01:27:31,702 --> 01:27:38,754
BENVOLIO O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,

1078
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:41,309
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

1079
01:27:41,309 --> 01:27:49,426
ROMEO This day's black fate on more days doth depend; This but begins the woe others must end.

1080
01:27:49,426 --> 01:27:51,433
BENVOLIO Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

1081
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:55,097
ROMEO Alive in triumph! and Mercutio slain!

1082
01:27:55,097 --> 01:28:01,985
Away to heaven respective lenity, And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!--

1083
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:08,240
[Re-enter Tybalt.] Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again

1084
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,793
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads,

1085
01:28:13,793 --> 01:28:21,543
Staying for thine to keep him company. Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

1086
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:25,279
TYBALT Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,

1087
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:26,848
Shalt with him hence.

1088
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:29,721
ROMEO This shall determine that.

1089
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,638
[They fight; Tybalt falls.]

1090
01:28:31,638 --> 01:28:36,991
BENVOLIO Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.--

1091
01:28:36,991 --> 01:28:43,007
Stand not amaz'd. The prince will doom thee death If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1092
01:28:43,007 --> 01:28:46,815
ROMEO O, I am fortune's fool!

1093
01:28:46,815 --> 01:28:48,230
BENVOLIO Why dost thou stay?

1094
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:52,775
[Exit Romeo.] [Enter Citizens, &c.]

1095
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:54,876
1 CITIZEN Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?

1096
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:57,145
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

1097
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:59,343
BENVOLIO There lies that Tybalt.

1098
01:28:59,343 --> 01:29:04,157
1 CITIZEN Up, sir, go with me; I charge thee in the prince's name obey.

1099
01:29:04,157 --> 01:29:09,934
[Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives, and others.]

1100
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:13,421
PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

1101
01:29:13,421 --> 01:29:15,525
BENVOLIO O noble prince. I can discover all

1102
01:29:15,525 --> 01:29:20,873
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,

1103
01:29:20,873 --> 01:29:23,762
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

1104
01:29:23,762 --> 01:29:27,442
LADY CAPULET Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!--

1105
01:29:27,442 --> 01:29:35,489
O prince!--O husband!--O, the blood is spill'd Of my dear kinsman!--Prince, as thou art true,

1106
01:29:35,489 --> 01:29:41,538
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.-- O cousin, cousin!

1107
01:29:41,538 --> 01:29:44,458
PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

1108
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:48,930
BENVOLIO Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;

1109
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:55,097
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal

1110
01:29:55,097 --> 01:30:02,096
Your high displeasure.--All this,--uttered With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,--

1111
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:07,522
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts

1112
01:30:07,522 --> 01:30:13,176
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast; Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,

1113
01:30:13,176 --> 01:30:18,152
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats Cold death aside, and with the other sends

1114
01:30:18,152 --> 01:30:22,536
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,

1115
01:30:22,536 --> 01:30:28,136
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points,

1116
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:33,376
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life

1117
01:30:33,376 --> 01:30:38,807
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled: But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,

1118
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:44,781
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I

1119
01:30:44,781 --> 01:30:51,410
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain; And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.

1120
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:54,511
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

1121
01:30:54,511 --> 01:31:00,840
LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague, Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:

1122
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:07,983
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life.

1123
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:16,863
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

1124
01:31:16,863 --> 01:31:20,335
PRINCE Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio:

1125
01:31:20,335 --> 01:31:24,274
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

1126
01:31:24,274 --> 01:31:31,509
MONTAGUE Not Romeo, prince; he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end,

1127
01:31:31,509 --> 01:31:33,775
The life of Tybalt.

1128
01:31:33,775 --> 01:31:35,558
PRINCE And for that offence

1129
01:31:35,558 --> 01:31:42,998
Immediately we do exile him hence: I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,

1130
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:50,929
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine

1131
01:31:50,929 --> 01:31:58,196
That you shall all repent the loss of mine: I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;

1132
01:31:58,196 --> 01:32:07,640
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,

1133
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:16,151
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last. Bear hence this body, and attend our will:

1134
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:23,039
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. [Exeunt.]

1135
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:27,876
Scene II. A Room in Capulet's House. [Enter Juliet.]

1136
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:31,609
JULIET Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,

1137
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:36,697
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such a waggoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west

1138
01:32:36,697 --> 01:32:43,792
And bring in cloudy night immediately.-- Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!

1139
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:50,414
That rude eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.--

1140
01:32:50,414 --> 01:32:56,608
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,

1141
01:32:56,608 --> 01:33:04,815
It best agrees with night.--Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,

1142
01:33:04,815 --> 01:33:10,824
And learn me how to lose a winning match, Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:

1143
01:33:10,824 --> 01:33:18,588
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,

1144
01:33:18,588 --> 01:33:28,059
Think true love acted simple modesty. Come, night;--come, Romeo;--come, thou day in night;

1145
01:33:28,059 --> 01:33:34,259
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.--

1146
01:33:34,259 --> 01:33:44,619
Come, gentle night;--come, loving, black-brow'd night, Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,

1147
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:50,754
Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine

1148
01:33:50,754 --> 01:33:55,897
That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun.--

1149
01:33:55,897 --> 01:34:02,409
O, I have bought the mansion of a love, But not possess'd it; and, though I am sold,

1150
01:34:02,409 --> 01:34:08,050
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day As is the night before some festival

1151
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:15,305
To an impatient child that hath new robes, And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,

1152
01:34:15,305 --> 01:34:22,024
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--

1153
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:28,808
[Enter Nurse, with cords.] Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords

1154
01:34:28,808 --> 01:34:30,440
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

1155
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,680
NURSE Ay, ay, the cords.

1156
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,759
[Throws them down.]

1157
01:34:33,759 --> 01:34:38,425
JULIET Ah me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

1158
01:34:38,425 --> 01:34:47,007
NURSE Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! We are undone, lady, we are undone!--

1159
01:34:47,007 --> 01:34:50,917
Alack the day!--he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

1160
01:34:50,917 --> 01:34:53,416
JULIET Can heaven be so envious?

1161
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:59,981
NURSE Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.--O Romeo, Romeo!--

1162
01:34:59,981 --> 01:35:02,723
Who ever would have thought it?--Romeo!

1163
01:35:02,723 --> 01:35:05,700
JULIET What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?

1164
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:12,706
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but I,

1165
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:17,043
And that bare vowel I shall poison more Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:

1166
01:35:17,043 --> 01:35:22,676
I am not I if there be such an I; Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I.

1167
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:29,946
If he be slain, say I; or if not, no: Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

1168
01:35:29,946 --> 01:35:33,288
NURSE I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--

1169
01:35:33,288 --> 01:35:41,899
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast. A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;

1170
01:35:41,899 --> 01:35:51,602
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, All in gore-blood;--I swounded at the sight.

1171
01:35:51,602 --> 01:35:57,268
JULIET O, break, my heart!--poor bankrout, break at once!

1172
01:35:57,268 --> 01:36:04,367
To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty! Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;

1173
01:36:04,367 --> 01:36:07,032
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

1174
01:36:07,032 --> 01:36:15,023
NURSE O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!

1175
01:36:15,023 --> 01:36:17,820
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

1176
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:24,672
JULIET What storm is this that blows so contrary? Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?

1177
01:36:24,672 --> 01:36:31,354
My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?-- Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!

1178
01:36:31,354 --> 01:36:34,111
For who is living, if those two are gone?

1179
01:36:34,111 --> 01:36:37,364
NURSE Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;

1180
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:40,265
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

1181
01:36:40,265 --> 01:36:44,243
JULIET O God!--did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

1182
01:36:44,243 --> 01:36:48,687
NURSE It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

1183
01:36:48,687 --> 01:36:52,207
JULIET O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!

1184
01:36:52,207 --> 01:36:59,406
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!

1185
01:36:59,406 --> 01:37:06,314
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show!

1186
01:37:06,314 --> 01:37:12,221
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st, A damned saint, an honourable villain!--

1187
01:37:12,221 --> 01:37:18,565
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend

1188
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:24,757
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?-- Was ever book containing such vile matter

1189
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:30,755
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace!

1190
01:37:30,755 --> 01:37:32,379
NURSE There's no trust,

1191
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:39,892
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.--

1192
01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:49,035
Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.-- These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.

1193
01:37:49,035 --> 01:37:50,988
Shame come to Romeo!

1194
01:37:50,988 --> 01:37:56,035
JULIET Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish! he was not born to shame:

1195
01:37:56,035 --> 01:38:01,515
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd

1196
01:38:01,515 --> 01:38:06,682
Sole monarch of the universal earth. O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

1197
01:38:06,682 --> 01:38:09,867
NURSE Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

1198
01:38:09,867 --> 01:38:12,483
JULIET Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

1199
01:38:12,483 --> 01:38:19,434
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I, thy three-hours' wife, have mangled it?--

1200
01:38:19,434 --> 01:38:27,058
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:

1201
01:38:27,058 --> 01:38:33,048
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; Your tributary drops belong to woe,

1202
01:38:33,048 --> 01:38:38,529
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;

1203
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:46,409
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: All this is comfort; wherefore weep I, then?

1204
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:52,744
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;

1205
01:38:52,744 --> 01:38:58,368
But O, it presses to my memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:

1206
01:38:58,368 --> 01:39:05,831
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.' That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'

1207
01:39:05,831 --> 01:39:11,799
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death Was woe enough, if it had ended there:

1208
01:39:11,799 --> 01:39:16,712
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship, And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,--

1209
01:39:16,712 --> 01:39:22,663
Why follow'd not, when she said Tybalt's dead, Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,

1210
01:39:22,663 --> 01:39:27,527
Which modern lamentation might have mov'd? But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,

1211
01:39:27,527 --> 01:39:34,381
'Romeo is banished'--to speak that word Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,

1212
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:41,477
All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished,'-- There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,

1213
01:39:41,477 --> 01:39:48,204
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.-- Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

1214
01:39:48,204 --> 01:39:50,910
NURSE Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:

1215
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:54,019
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

1216
01:39:54,019 --> 01:40:00,902
JULIET Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.

1217
01:40:00,902 --> 01:40:08,485
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd, Both you and I; for Romeo is exil'd:

1218
01:40:08,485 --> 01:40:14,620
He made you for a highway to my bed; But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.

1219
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:22,532
Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed; And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

1220
01:40:22,532 --> 01:40:26,067
NURSE Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo

1221
01:40:26,067 --> 01:40:33,378
To comfort you: I wot well where he is. Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:

1222
01:40:33,378 --> 01:40:37,923
I'll to him; he is hid at Lawrence' cell.

1223
01:40:37,923 --> 01:40:41,243
JULIET O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,

1224
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:45,612
And bid him come to take his last farewell. [Exeunt.]

1225
01:40:45,612 --> 01:40:51,095
Scene III. Friar Lawrence's cell. [Enter Friar Lawrence.]

1226
01:40:51,095 --> 01:40:56,548
FRIAR Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.

1227
01:40:56,548 --> 01:41:02,880
Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts, And thou art wedded to calamity.

1228
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,536
[Enter Romeo.]

1229
01:41:04,536 --> 01:41:08,256
ROMEO Father, what news? what is the prince's doom

1230
01:41:08,256 --> 01:41:11,479
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, That I yet know not?

1231
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:12,847
FRIAR Too familiar

1232
01:41:12,847 --> 01:41:19,121
Is my dear son with such sour company: I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

1233
01:41:19,121 --> 01:41:22,599
ROMEO What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?

1234
01:41:22,599 --> 01:41:25,959
FRIAR A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,--

1235
01:41:25,959 --> 01:41:29,739
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

1236
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:37,470
ROMEO Ha, banishment? be merciful, say death; For exile hath more terror in his look,

1237
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:40,264
Much more than death; do not say banishment.

1238
01:41:40,264 --> 01:41:48,854
FRIAR Hence from Verona art thou banished: Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

1239
01:41:48,854 --> 01:41:52,501
ROMEO There is no world without Verona walls,

1240
01:41:52,501 --> 01:41:58,655
But purgatory, torture, hell itself. Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,

1241
01:41:58,655 --> 01:42:05,957
And world's exile is death,--then banished Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,

1242
01:42:05,957 --> 01:42:10,916
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.

1243
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:14,805
FRIAR O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

1244
01:42:14,805 --> 01:42:23,709
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, Taking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,

1245
01:42:23,709 --> 01:42:33,339
And turn'd that black word death to banishment: This is dear mercy, and thou see'st it not.

1246
01:42:33,339 --> 01:42:38,068
ROMEO 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,

1247
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:43,850
Where Juliet lives; and every cat, and dog, And little mouse, every unworthy thing,

1248
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:51,163
Live here in heaven, and may look on her; But Romeo may not.--More validity,

1249
01:42:51,163 --> 01:42:58,177
More honourable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize

1250
01:42:58,177 --> 01:43:04,281
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand, And steal immortal blessing from her lips;

1251
01:43:04,281 --> 01:43:11,589
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;

1252
01:43:11,589 --> 01:43:21,097
But Romeo may not; he is banished,-- This may flies do, when I from this must fly.

1253
01:43:21,097 --> 01:43:29,728
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death! Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,

1254
01:43:29,728 --> 01:43:35,168
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But banished to kill me; banished?

1255
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:45,703
O friar, the damned use that word in hell; Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,

1256
01:43:45,703 --> 01:43:51,336
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,

1257
01:43:51,336 --> 01:43:54,924
To mangle me with that word banishment?

1258
01:43:54,924 --> 01:43:59,795
FRIAR Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,--

1259
01:43:59,795 --> 01:44:03,913
ROMEO O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

1260
01:44:03,913 --> 01:44:11,114
FRIAR I'll give thee armour to keep off that word; Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,

1261
01:44:11,114 --> 01:44:14,416
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

1262
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:21,813
ROMEO Yet banished? Hang up philosophy! Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,

1263
01:44:21,813 --> 01:44:29,181
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, It helps not, it prevails not,--talk no more.

1264
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:33,189
FRIAR O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

1265
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:37,606
ROMEO How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

1266
01:44:37,606 --> 01:44:40,317
FRIAR Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

1267
01:44:40,317 --> 01:44:43,525
ROMEO Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:

1268
01:44:43,525 --> 01:44:50,547
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,

1269
01:44:50,547 --> 01:44:57,692
Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,

1270
01:44:57,692 --> 01:45:02,444
And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

1271
01:45:02,444 --> 01:45:04,516
[Knocking within.]

1272
01:45:04,516 --> 01:45:08,966
FRIAR Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

1273
01:45:08,966 --> 01:45:13,134
ROMEO Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,

1274
01:45:13,134 --> 01:45:18,510
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. [Knocking.]

1275
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:23,109
FRIAR Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo, arise;

1276
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:27,783
Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile;--Stand up; [Knocking.]

1277
01:45:27,783 --> 01:45:34,823
Run to my study.--By-and-by!--God's will! What simpleness is this.--I come, I come!

1278
01:45:34,823 --> 01:45:40,808
[Knocking.] Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

1279
01:45:40,808 --> 01:45:44,464
NURSE [Within.] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;

1280
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:46,845
I come from Lady Juliet.

1281
01:45:46,845 --> 01:45:48,157
FRIAR Welcome then.

1282
01:45:48,157 --> 01:45:49,120
[Enter Nurse.]

1283
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:56,107
NURSE O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar, Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

1284
01:45:56,107 --> 01:46:00,109
FRIAR There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

1285
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:03,252
NURSE O, he is even in my mistress' case,--

1286
01:46:03,252 --> 01:46:04,696
Just in her case!

1287
01:46:04,696 --> 01:46:08,516
FRIAR O woeful sympathy! Piteous predicament!

1288
01:46:08,516 --> 01:46:10,274
NURSE Even so lies she,

1289
01:46:10,274 --> 01:46:17,082
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.-- Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:

1290
01:46:17,082 --> 01:46:24,586
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; Why should you fall into so deep an O?

1291
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:25,790
ROMEO Nurse!

1292
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:28,666
NURSE Ah sir! ah sir!--Well, death's the end of all.

1293
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:32,098
ROMEO Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?

1294
01:46:32,098 --> 01:46:37,579
Doth not she think me an old murderer, Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy

1295
01:46:37,579 --> 01:46:44,184
With blood remov'd but little from her own? Where is she? and how doth she? and what says

1296
01:46:44,184 --> 01:46:46,911
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

1297
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:49,830
NURSE O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;

1298
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:56,358
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,

1299
01:46:56,358 --> 01:46:58,235
And then down falls again.

1300
01:46:58,235 --> 01:47:02,318
ROMEO As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun,

1301
01:47:02,318 --> 01:47:09,736
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand Murder'd her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,

1302
01:47:09,736 --> 01:47:14,269
In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack

1303
01:47:14,269 --> 01:47:17,223
The hateful mansion. [Drawing his sword.]

1304
01:47:17,223 --> 01:47:18,981
FRIAR Hold thy desperate hand:

1305
01:47:18,981 --> 01:47:27,300
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art; Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote

1306
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:33,732
The unreasonable fury of a beast; Unseemly woman in a seeming man!

1307
01:47:33,732 --> 01:47:42,460
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,

1308
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:50,795
I thought thy disposition better temper'd. Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?

1309
01:47:50,795 --> 01:47:57,852
And slay thy lady, too, that lives in thee, By doing damned hate upon thyself?

1310
01:47:57,852 --> 01:48:07,781
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet

1311
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:22,298
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit;

1312
01:48:22,298 --> 01:48:28,463
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, And usest none in that true use indeed

1313
01:48:28,463 --> 01:48:38,125
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,

1314
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:45,094
Digressing from the valour of a man; Thy dear love sworn, but hollow perjury,

1315
01:48:45,094 --> 01:48:53,702
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,

1316
01:48:53,702 --> 01:49:00,805
Mis-shapen in the conduct of them both, Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,

1317
01:49:00,805 --> 01:49:07,892
Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance, And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.

1318
01:49:07,892 --> 01:49:19,063
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;

1319
01:49:19,063 --> 01:49:27,515
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slewest Tybalt; there art thou happy too:

1320
01:49:27,515 --> 01:49:37,187
The law, that threaten'd death, becomes thy friend, And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:

1321
01:49:37,187 --> 01:49:43,554
A pack of blessings lights upon thy back; Happiness courts thee in her best array;

1322
01:49:43,554 --> 01:49:51,323
But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench, Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:--

1323
01:49:51,323 --> 01:50:02,226
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,

1324
01:50:02,226 --> 01:50:11,761
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: But, look, thou stay not till the watch be set,

1325
01:50:11,761 --> 01:50:19,602
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; Where thou shalt live till we can find a time

1326
01:50:19,602 --> 01:50:26,065
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back

1327
01:50:26,065 --> 01:50:32,590
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--

1328
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:41,470
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; And bid her hasten all the house to bed,

1329
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:48,643
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto. Romeo is coming.

1330
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:50,785
NURSE O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night

1331
01:50:50,785 --> 01:50:57,448
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!-- My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

1332
01:50:57,448 --> 01:51:01,544
ROMEO Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

1333
01:51:01,544 --> 01:51:04,216
NURSE Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:

1334
01:51:04,216 --> 01:51:08,735
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. [Exit.]

1335
01:51:08,735 --> 01:51:13,064
ROMEO How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!

1336
01:51:13,064 --> 01:51:18,511
FRIAR Go hence; good night! and here stands all your state:

1337
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:25,630
Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.

1338
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:32,922
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time

1339
01:51:32,922 --> 01:51:42,145
Every good hap to you that chances here: Give me thy hand; 'tis late; farewell; good night.

1340
01:51:42,145 --> 01:51:45,488
ROMEO But that a joy past joy calls out on me,

1341
01:51:45,488 --> 01:51:50,144
It were a grief so brief to part with thee: Farewell

1342
01:51:50,144 --> 01:51:51,798
[Exeunt.]

1343
01:51:51,798 --> 01:51:59,598
Scene IV. A Room in Capulet's House. [Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and Paris.]

1344
01:51:59,598 --> 01:52:02,921
CAPULET Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily

1345
01:52:02,921 --> 01:52:09,397
That we have had no time to move our daughter: Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,

1346
01:52:09,397 --> 01:52:17,800
And so did I; well, we were born to die. 'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night:

1347
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:22,617
I promise you, but for your company, I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

1348
01:52:22,617 --> 01:52:26,489
PARIS These times of woe afford no tune to woo.--

1349
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:29,723
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

1350
01:52:29,723 --> 01:52:36,528
LADY CAPULET I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.

1351
01:52:36,528 --> 01:52:39,616
CAPULET Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender

1352
01:52:39,616 --> 01:52:46,285
Of my child's love: I think she will be rul'd In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.--

1353
01:52:46,285 --> 01:52:52,503
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;

1354
01:52:52,503 --> 01:52:59,191
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,-- But, soft! what day is this?

1355
01:52:59,191 --> 01:53:01,008
PARIS Monday, my lord.

1356
01:53:01,008 --> 01:53:04,791
CAPULET Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,

1357
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:10,205
Thursday let it be;--a Thursday, tell her, She shall be married to this noble earl.--

1358
01:53:10,205 --> 01:53:16,325
Will you be ready? do you like this haste? We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;

1359
01:53:16,325 --> 01:53:21,908
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly,

1360
01:53:21,908 --> 01:53:27,894
Being our kinsman, if we revel much: Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,

1361
01:53:27,894 --> 01:53:31,197
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

1362
01:53:31,197 --> 01:53:35,197
PARIS My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

1363
01:53:35,197 --> 01:53:38,501
CAPULET Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it then.--

1364
01:53:38,501 --> 01:53:44,525
Go you to Juliet, ere you go to bed, Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.--

1365
01:53:44,525 --> 01:53:52,780
Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!-- Afore me, it is so very very late

1366
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:56,220
That we may call it early by and by.-- Good night.

1367

Scene V. An open Gallery to Juliet's Chamber, overlooking the Garden.

1369
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:06,042
[Enter Romeo and Juliet.]

1370
01:54:06,042 --> 01:54:13,106
JULIET Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: It was the nightingale, and not the lark,

1371
01:54:13,106 --> 01:54:19,053
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree:

1372
01:54:19,053 --> 01:54:21,474
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

1373
01:54:21,474 --> 01:54:29,662
ROMEO It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks

1374
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:37,566
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day

1375
01:54:37,566 --> 01:54:46,510
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

1376
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:49,326
JULIET Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I:

1377
01:54:49,326 --> 01:54:55,037
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torch-bearer

1378
01:54:55,037 --> 01:55:01,237
And light thee on the way to Mantua: Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.

1379
01:55:01,237 --> 01:55:05,100
ROMEO Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;

1380
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:13,544
I am content, so thou wilt have it so. I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye,

1381
01:55:13,544 --> 01:55:19,843
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat

1382
01:55:19,843 --> 01:55:26,682
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: I have more care to stay than will to go.--

1383
01:55:26,682 --> 01:55:37,744
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.-- How is't, my soul? let's talk,--it is not day.

1384
01:55:37,744 --> 01:55:42,159
JULIET It is, it is!--hie hence, be gone, away!

1385
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:47,656
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.

1386
01:55:47,656 --> 01:55:53,636
Some say the lark makes sweet division; This doth not so, for she divideth us:

1387
01:55:53,636 --> 01:56:00,239
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes; O, now I would they had chang'd voices too!

1388
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:06,851
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.

1389
01:56:06,851 --> 01:56:09,908
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

1390
01:56:09,908 --> 01:56:17,574
ROMEO More light and light,--more dark and dark our woes! [Enter Nurse.]

1391
01:56:17,574 --> 01:56:19,208
NURSE Madam!

1392
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:20,358
JULIET Nurse?

1393
01:56:20,358 --> 01:56:22,808
NURSE Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:

1394
01:56:22,808 --> 01:56:26,967
The day is broke; be wary, look about. [Exit.]

1395
01:56:26,967 --> 01:56:30,686
JULIET Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

1396
01:56:30,686 --> 01:56:35,688
ROMEO Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

1397
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:36,585
[Descends.]

1398
01:56:36,585 --> 01:56:45,389
JULIET Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend! I must hear from thee every day i' the hour,

1399
01:56:45,389 --> 01:56:50,757
For in a minute there are many days: O, by this count I shall be much in years

1400
01:56:50,757 --> 01:56:52,450
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

1401
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:56,666
ROMEO Farewell! I will omit no opportunity

1402
01:56:56,666 --> 01:56:59,848
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

1403
01:56:59,848 --> 01:57:02,979
JULIET O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

1404
01:57:02,979 --> 01:57:06,490
ROMEO I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve

1405
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:08,777
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

1406
01:57:08,777 --> 01:57:16,605
JULIET O God! I have an ill-divining soul! Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,

1407
01:57:16,605 --> 01:57:22,491
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb: Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

1408
01:57:22,491 --> 01:57:26,900
ROMEO And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:

1409
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:37,186
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! [Exit below.]

1410
01:57:37,186 --> 01:57:41,794
JULIET O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:

1411
01:57:41,794 --> 01:57:48,635
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;

1412
01:57:48,635 --> 01:57:52,952
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long But send him back.

1413
01:57:52,952 --> 01:57:57,343
LADY CAPULET [Within.] Ho, daughter! are you up?

1414
01:57:57,343 --> 01:58:00,162
JULIET Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?

1415
01:58:00,162 --> 01:58:05,770
Is she not down so late, or up so early? What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

1416
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:07,078
[Enter Lady Capulet.]

1417
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:09,493
LADY CAPULET Why, how now, Juliet?

1418
01:58:09,493 --> 01:58:11,151
JULIET Madam, I am not well.

1419
01:58:11,151 --> 01:58:18,417
LADY CAPULET Evermore weeping for your cousin's death? What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?

1420
01:58:18,417 --> 01:58:26,430
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love;

1421
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:29,907
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

1422
01:58:29,907 --> 01:58:32,722
JULIET Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

1423
01:58:32,722 --> 01:58:37,808
LADY CAPULET So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.

1424
01:58:37,808 --> 01:58:39,472
JULIET Feeling so the loss,

1425
01:58:39,472 --> 01:58:40,912
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

1426
01:58:40,912 --> 01:58:47,688
LADY CAPULET Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

1427
01:58:47,688 --> 01:58:49,320
JULIET What villain, madam?

1428
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:51,321
LADY CAPULET That same villain Romeo.

1429
01:58:51,321 --> 01:58:54,179
JULIET Villain and he be many miles asunder.--

1430
01:58:54,179 --> 01:59:00,320
God pardon him! I do, with all my heart; And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

1431
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:03,552
LADY CAPULET That is because the traitor murderer lives.

1432
01:59:03,552 --> 01:59:06,651
JULIET Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.

1433
01:59:06,651 --> 01:59:09,539
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

1434
01:59:09,539 --> 01:59:17,027
LADY CAPULET We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,--

1435
01:59:17,027 --> 01:59:22,411
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,-- Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram

1436
01:59:22,411 --> 01:59:27,826
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

1437
01:59:27,826 --> 01:59:30,023
JULIET Indeed I never shall be satisfied

1438
01:59:30,023 --> 01:59:36,175
With Romeo till I behold him--dead-- Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:

1439
01:59:36,175 --> 01:59:41,329
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it,

1440
01:59:41,329 --> 01:59:47,555
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors

1441
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:52,275
To hear him nam'd,--and cannot come to him,-- To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt

1442
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:54,028
Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

1443
01:59:54,028 --> 02:00:01,882
LADY CAPULET Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

1444
02:00:01,882 --> 02:00:04,390
JULIET And joy comes well in such a needy time:

1445
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,137
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

1446
02:00:06,137 --> 02:00:13,493
LADY CAPULET Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,

1447
02:00:13,493 --> 02:00:19,782
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.

1448
02:00:19,782 --> 02:00:22,203
JULIET Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

1449
02:00:22,203 --> 02:00:26,189
LADY CAPULET Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn

1450
02:00:26,189 --> 02:00:31,357
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at St. Peter's Church,

1451
02:00:31,357 --> 02:00:34,269
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

1452
02:00:34,269 --> 02:00:37,139
JULIET Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,

1453
02:00:37,139 --> 02:00:43,156
He shall not make me there a joyful bride. I wonder at this haste; that I must wed

1454
02:00:43,156 --> 02:00:48,445
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,

1455
02:00:48,445 --> 02:00:53,827
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,

1456
02:00:53,827 --> 02:00:56,167
Rather than Paris:--these are news indeed!

1457
02:00:56,167 --> 02:01:01,444
LADY CAPULET Here comes your father: tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.

1458
02:01:01,444 --> 02:01:03,178
[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]

1459
02:01:03,178 --> 02:01:09,308
CAPULET When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; But for the sunset of my brother's son

1460
02:01:09,308 --> 02:01:15,122
It rains downright.-- How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?

1461
02:01:15,122 --> 02:01:21,484
Evermore showering? In one little body Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:

1462
02:01:21,484 --> 02:01:28,796
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,

1463
02:01:28,796 --> 02:01:35,527
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; Who,--raging with thy tears and they with them,--

1464
02:01:35,527 --> 02:01:41,094
Without a sudden calm, will overset Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife!

1465
02:01:41,094 --> 02:01:42,932
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

1466
02:01:42,932 --> 02:01:49,562
LADY CAPULET Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave!

1467
02:01:49,562 --> 02:01:53,306
CAPULET Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.

1468
02:01:53,306 --> 02:02:01,441
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? Is she not proud? doth she not count her bles'd,

1469
02:02:01,441 --> 02:02:06,694
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

1470
02:02:06,694 --> 02:02:10,174
JULIET Not proud you have; but thankful that you have:

1471
02:02:10,174 --> 02:02:15,385
Proud can I never be of what I hate; But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

1472
02:02:15,385 --> 02:02:20,032
CAPULET How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?

1473
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:27,130
Proud,--and, I thank you,--and I thank you not;-- And yet not proud:--mistress minion, you,

1474
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:33,265
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next

1475
02:02:33,265 --> 02:02:38,287
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

1476
02:02:38,287 --> 02:02:43,833
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! You tallow-face!

1477
02:02:43,833 --> 02:02:46,481
LADY CAPULET Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

1478
02:02:46,481 --> 02:02:49,792
JULIET Good father, I beseech you on my knees,

1479
02:02:49,792 --> 02:02:51,985
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

1480
02:02:51,985 --> 02:02:55,344
CAPULET Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!

1481
02:02:55,344 --> 02:02:59,512
I tell thee what,--get thee to church o' Thursday, Or never after look me in the face:

1482
02:02:59,512 --> 02:03:07,616
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us bles'd

1483
02:03:07,616 --> 02:03:12,327
That God had lent us but this only child; But now I see this one is one too much,

1484
02:03:12,327 --> 02:03:16,679
And that we have a curse in having her: Out on her, hilding!

1485
02:03:16,679 --> 02:03:18,679
NURSE God in heaven bless her!--

1486
02:03:18,679 --> 02:03:21,166
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

1487
02:03:21,166 --> 02:03:28,262
CAPULET And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

1488
02:03:28,262 --> 02:03:30,223
NURSE I speak no treason.

1489
02:03:30,223 --> 02:03:32,384
CAPULET O, God ye good-en!

1490
02:03:32,384 --> 02:03:33,729
NURSE May not one speak?

1491
02:03:33,729 --> 02:03:35,412
CAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool!

1492
02:03:35,412 --> 02:03:38,857
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, For here we need it not.

1493
02:03:38,857 --> 02:03:40,464
LADY CAPULET You are too hot.

1494
02:03:40,464 --> 02:03:43,010
CAPULET God's bread! it makes me mad:

1495
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:50,384
Day, night, hour, time, tide, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been

1496
02:03:50,384 --> 02:03:55,545
To have her match'd, and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage,

1497
02:03:55,545 --> 02:04:01,640
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,

1498
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:08,001
Proportion'd as one's heart would wish a man,-- And then to have a wretched puling fool,

1499
02:04:08,001 --> 02:04:14,807
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, To answer, 'I'll not wed,--I cannot love,

1500
02:04:14,807 --> 02:04:21,064
I am too young,--I pray you pardon me:'-- But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:

1501
02:04:21,064 --> 02:04:28,031
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me: Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.

1502
02:04:28,031 --> 02:04:34,783
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;

1503
02:04:34,783 --> 02:04:41,582
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die i' the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

1504
02:04:41,582 --> 02:04:48,573
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good: Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn.

1505
02:04:48,573 --> 02:04:49,375
[Exit.]

1506
02:04:49,375 --> 02:04:54,149
JULIET Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, That sees into the bottom of my grief?

1507
02:04:54,149 --> 02:05:00,605
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away! Delay this marriage for a month, a week;

1508
02:05:00,605 --> 02:05:04,787
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

1509
02:05:04,787 --> 02:05:08,733
LADY CAPULET Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word;

1510
02:05:08,733 --> 02:05:13,468
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. [Exit.]

1511
02:05:13,468 --> 02:05:18,611
JULIET O God!--O nurse! how shall this be prevented?

1512
02:05:18,611 --> 02:05:24,347
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; How shall that faith return again to earth,

1513
02:05:24,347 --> 02:05:30,604
Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?--comfort me, counsel me.--

1514
02:05:30,604 --> 02:05:36,906
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself!--

1515
02:05:36,906 --> 02:05:44,115
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, nurse.

1516
02:05:44,115 --> 02:05:47,130
NURSE Faith, here 'tis; Romeo

1517
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:52,808
Is banished; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;

1518
02:05:52,808 --> 02:05:59,954
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,

1519
02:05:59,954 --> 02:06:05,809
I think it best you married with the county. O, he's a lovely gentleman!

1520
02:06:05,809 --> 02:06:13,457
Romeo's a dishclout to him; an eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye

1521
02:06:13,457 --> 02:06:19,721
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match,

1522
02:06:19,721 --> 02:06:27,495
For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,

1523
02:06:27,495 --> 02:06:30,008
As living here, and you no use of him.

1524
02:06:30,008 --> 02:06:32,126
JULIET Speakest thou this from thy heart?

1525
02:06:32,126 --> 02:06:34,416
NURSE And from my soul too;

1526
02:06:34,416 --> 02:06:35,674
Or else beshrew them both.

1527
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:36,914
JULIET Amen!

1528
02:06:36,914 --> 02:06:38,093
NURSE What?

1529
02:06:38,093 --> 02:06:41,714
JULIET Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.

1530
02:06:41,714 --> 02:06:47,890
Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeas'd my father, to Lawrence' cell,

1531
02:06:47,890 --> 02:06:50,161
To make confession and to be absolv'd.

1532
02:06:50,161 --> 02:06:54,225
NURSE Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

[Exit.]

1534
02:06:54,956 --> 02:07:03,737
JULIET Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,

1535
02:07:03,737 --> 02:07:08,617
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais'd him with above compare

1536
02:07:08,617 --> 02:07:16,427
So many thousand times?--Go, counsellor; Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.--

1537
02:07:16,427 --> 02:07:23,173
I'll to the friar to know his remedy; If all else fail, myself have power to die.

1538
02:07:23,173 --> 02:07:30,600

ROMEO AND JULIET by William Shakespeare

1541
02:07:36,201 --> 02:07:40,644
ACT IV. Scene I. Friar Lawrence's Cell.

1542
02:07:40,644 --> 02:07:43,203
[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.]

1543
02:07:43,203 --> 02:07:46,530
FRIAR On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

1544
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:51,763
PARIS My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

1545
02:07:51,763 --> 02:07:54,155
FRIAR You say you do not know the lady's mind:

1546
02:07:54,155 --> 02:07:57,195
Uneven is the course; I like it not.

1547
02:07:57,195 --> 02:08:04,464
PARIS Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, And therefore have I little talk'd of love;

1548
02:08:04,464 --> 02:08:14,039
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous

1549
02:08:14,039 --> 02:08:22,087
That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And, in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,

1550
02:08:22,087 --> 02:08:28,673
To stop the inundation of her tears; Which, too much minded by herself alone,

1551
02:08:28,673 --> 02:08:35,693
May be put from her by society: Now do you know the reason of this haste.

1552
02:08:35,693 --> 02:08:40,418
FRIAR [Aside.] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.--

1553
02:08:40,418 --> 02:08:45,323
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. [Enter Juliet.]

1554
02:08:45,323 --> 02:08:48,181
PARIS Happily met, my lady and my wife!

1555
02:08:48,181 --> 02:08:51,045
JULIET That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

1556
02:08:51,045 --> 02:08:56,145
PARIS That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

1557
02:08:56,145 --> 02:08:58,044
JULIET What must be shall be.

1558
02:08:58,044 --> 02:09:00,442
FRIAR That's a certain text.

1559
02:09:00,442 --> 02:09:03,787
PARIS Come you to make confession to this father?

1560
02:09:03,787 --> 02:09:06,245
JULIET To answer that, I should confess to you.

1561
02:09:06,245 --> 02:09:09,083
PARIS Do not deny to him that you love me.

1562
02:09:09,083 --> 02:09:11,134
JULIET I will confess to you that I love him.

1563
02:09:11,134 --> 02:09:13,774
PARIS So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

1564
02:09:13,774 --> 02:09:16,316
JULIET If I do so, it will be of more price,

1565
02:09:16,316 --> 02:09:18,689
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.

1566
02:09:18,689 --> 02:09:22,104
PARIS Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.

1567
02:09:22,104 --> 02:09:27,820
JULIET The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite.

1568
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:31,011
PARIS Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.

1569
02:09:31,011 --> 02:09:33,508
JULIET That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;

1570
02:09:33,508 --> 02:09:36,123
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

1571
02:09:36,123 --> 02:09:39,860
PARIS Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

1572
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:45,723
JULIET It may be so, for it is not mine own.-- Are you at leisure, holy father, now;

1573
02:09:45,723 --> 02:09:47,740
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

1574
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:55,118
FRIAR My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.-- My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

1575
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:57,725
PARIS God shield I should disturb devotion!--

1576
02:09:57,725 --> 02:10:06,152
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you: Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

1577
02:10:06,152 --> 02:10:06,734
[Exit.]

1578
02:10:06,734 --> 02:10:15,958
JULIET O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

1579
02:10:15,958 --> 02:10:19,861
FRIAR Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;

1580
02:10:19,861 --> 02:10:27,260
It strains me past the compass of my wits: I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,

1581
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:30,675
On Thursday next be married to this county.

1582
02:10:30,675 --> 02:10:35,965
JULIET Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:

1583
02:10:35,965 --> 02:10:40,964
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise,

1584
02:10:40,964 --> 02:10:47,566
And with this knife I'll help it presently. God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;

1585
02:10:47,566 --> 02:10:52,667
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd, Shall be the label to another deed,

1586
02:10:52,667 --> 02:10:57,611
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both:

1587
02:10:57,611 --> 02:11:03,691
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, Give me some present counsel; or, behold,

1588
02:11:03,691 --> 02:11:08,538
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire; arbitrating that

1589
02:11:08,538 --> 02:11:12,450
Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring.

1590
02:11:12,450 --> 02:11:19,697
Be not so long to speak; I long to die, If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

1591
02:11:19,697 --> 02:11:24,066
FRIAR Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,

1592
02:11:24,066 --> 02:11:29,753
Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent.

1593
02:11:29,753 --> 02:11:37,457
If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,

1594
02:11:37,457 --> 02:11:44,719
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame,

1595
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:53,633
That cop'st with death himself to scape from it; And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.

1596
02:11:53,633 --> 02:11:56,752
JULIET O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,

1597
02:11:56,752 --> 02:12:01,895
From off the battlements of yonder tower; Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk

1598
02:12:01,895 --> 02:12:07,783
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,

1599
02:12:07,783 --> 02:12:13,822
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;

1600
02:12:13,822 --> 02:12:18,652
Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;

1601
02:12:18,652 --> 02:12:24,740
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; And I will do it without fear or doubt,

1602
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,377
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

1603
02:12:27,377 --> 02:12:36,686
FRIAR Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow;

1604
02:12:36,686 --> 02:12:44,861
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:

1605
02:12:44,861 --> 02:12:53,346
Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off:

1606
02:12:53,346 --> 02:13:02,217
When, presently, through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse

1607
02:13:02,217 --> 02:13:11,105
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease: No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;

1608
02:13:11,105 --> 02:13:19,323
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,

1609
02:13:19,323 --> 02:13:27,318
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; Each part, depriv'd of supple government,

1610
02:13:27,318 --> 02:13:36,293
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death: And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death

1611
02:13:36,293 --> 02:13:44,261
Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

1612
02:13:44,261 --> 02:13:52,372
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:

1613
02:13:52,372 --> 02:13:59,764
Then,--as the manner of our country is,-- In thy best robes, uncover'd, on the bier,

1614
02:13:59,764 --> 02:14:06,030
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

1615
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:13,631
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;

1616
02:14:13,631 --> 02:14:20,041
And hither shall he come: and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night

1617
02:14:20,041 --> 02:14:27,306
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame,

1618
02:14:27,306 --> 02:14:33,896
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it.

1619
02:14:33,896 --> 02:14:36,929
JULIET Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

1620
02:14:36,929 --> 02:14:41,361
FRIAR Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous

1621
02:14:41,361 --> 02:14:47,897
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

1622
02:14:47,897 --> 02:14:51,947
JULIET Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.

1623
02:14:51,947 --> 02:14:55,732
Farewell, dear father. [Exeunt.]

1624
02:14:55,732 --> 02:15:03,444
Scene II. Hall in Capulet's House. [Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse, and Servants.]

1625
02:15:03,444 --> 02:15:06,667
CAPULET So many guests invite as here are writ.--

1626
02:15:06,667 --> 02:15:12,490
[Exit first Servant.] Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

1627
02:15:12,490 --> 02:15:15,754
2 SERVANT You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can

1628
02:15:15,754 --> 02:15:16,605
lick their fingers.

1629
02:15:16,605 --> 02:15:18,106
CAPULET How canst thou try them so?

1630
02:15:18,106 --> 02:15:25,746
2 SERVANT Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

1631
02:15:25,746 --> 02:15:27,466
CAPULET Go, begone.--

1632
02:15:27,466 --> 02:15:31,611
[Exit second Servant.] We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.--

1633
02:15:31,611 --> 02:15:34,446
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?

1634
02:15:34,446 --> 02:15:35,998
NURSE Ay, forsooth.

1635
02:15:35,998 --> 02:15:43,990
CAPULET Well, be may chance to do some good on her: A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

1636
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:47,062
NURSE See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

1637
02:15:47,062 --> 02:15:47,964
[Enter Juliet.]

1638
02:15:47,964 --> 02:15:51,687
CAPULET How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

1639
02:15:51,687 --> 02:15:56,124
JULIET Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition

1640
02:15:56,124 --> 02:16:01,442
To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,

1641
02:16:01,442 --> 02:16:08,026
To beg your pardon:--pardon, I beseech you! Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.

1642
02:16:08,026 --> 02:16:11,082
CAPULET Send for the county; go tell him of this:

1643
02:16:11,082 --> 02:16:13,897
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

1644
02:16:13,897 --> 02:16:16,201
JULIET I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell;

1645
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:20,834
And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

1646
02:16:20,834 --> 02:16:24,664
CAPULET Why, I am glad on't; this is well,--stand up,--

1647
02:16:24,664 --> 02:16:30,736
This is as't should be.--Let me see the county; Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--

1648
02:16:30,736 --> 02:16:36,409
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, All our whole city is much bound to him.

1649
02:16:36,409 --> 02:16:39,529
JULIET Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,

1650
02:16:39,529 --> 02:16:43,689
To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

1651
02:16:43,689 --> 02:16:47,344
LADY CAPULET No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

1652
02:16:47,344 --> 02:16:50,992
CAPULET Go, nurse, go with her.--We'll to church to-morrow.

1653
02:16:50,992 --> 02:16:52,628
[Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.]

1654
02:16:52,628 --> 02:16:57,231
LADY CAPULET We shall be short in our provision: 'Tis now near night.

1655
02:16:57,231 --> 02:16:59,511
CAPULET Tush, I will stir about,

1656
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:05,550
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife: Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;

1657
02:17:05,550 --> 02:17:13,396
I'll not to bed to-night;--let me alone; I'll play the housewife for this once.--What, ho!--

1658
02:17:13,396 --> 02:17:19,211
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself To County Paris, to prepare him up

1659
02:17:19,211 --> 02:17:26,374
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

1660
02:17:26,374 --> 02:17:28,004
[Exeunt.]

1661

Scene III. Juliet's Chamber. [Enter Juliet and Nurse.]

1662
02:17:33,108 --> 02:17:37,260
JULIET Ay, those attires are best:--but, gentle nurse,

1663
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:42,292
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night; For I have need of many orisons

1664
02:17:42,292 --> 02:17:47,649
To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.

1665
02:17:47,649 --> 02:17:48,806
[Enter Lady Capulet.]

1666
02:17:48,806 --> 02:17:52,382
LADY CAPULET What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

1667
02:17:52,382 --> 02:17:57,979
JULIET No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:

1668
02:17:57,979 --> 02:18:02,842
So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you;

1669
02:18:02,842 --> 02:18:06,882
For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.

1670
02:18:06,882 --> 02:18:08,338
LADY CAPULET Good night:

1671
02:18:08,338 --> 02:18:14,785
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. [Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]

1672
02:18:14,785 --> 02:18:18,890
JULIET Farewell!--God knows when we shall meet again.

1673
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:25,879
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life:

1674
02:18:25,879 --> 02:18:32,643
I'll call them back again to comfort me;-- Nurse!--What should she do here?

1675
02:18:32,643 --> 02:18:38,166
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.-- Come, vial.--

1676
02:18:38,166 --> 02:18:44,438
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married, then, to-morrow morning?--

1677
02:18:44,438 --> 02:18:51,381
No, No!--this shall forbid it:--lie thou there.-- [Laying down her dagger.]

1678
02:18:51,381 --> 02:18:56,421
What if it be a poison, which the friar Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,

1679
02:18:56,421 --> 02:19:01,076
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, Because he married me before to Romeo?

1680
02:19:01,076 --> 02:19:06,908
I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man:--

1681
02:19:06,908 --> 02:19:12,698
I will not entertain so bad a thought.-- How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

1682
02:19:12,698 --> 02:19:17,571
I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!

1683
02:19:17,571 --> 02:19:24,451
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,

1684
02:19:24,451 --> 02:19:30,863
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? Or, if I live, is it not very like

1685
02:19:30,863 --> 02:19:34,746
The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place,--

1686
02:19:34,746 --> 02:19:40,146
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where, for this many hundred years, the bones

1687
02:19:40,146 --> 02:19:45,561
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd; Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,

1688
02:19:45,561 --> 02:19:51,608
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort;--

1689
02:19:51,608 --> 02:19:59,297
Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking,--what with loathsome smells,

1690
02:19:59,297 --> 02:20:04,048
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad;--

1691
02:20:04,048 --> 02:20:09,973
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears?

1692
02:20:09,973 --> 02:20:15,845
And madly play with my forefathers' joints? And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?

1693
02:20:15,845 --> 02:20:21,773
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?--

1694
02:20:21,773 --> 02:20:28,005
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body

1695
02:20:28,005 --> 02:20:37,861
Upon a rapier's point:--stay, Tybalt, stay!-- Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

1696
02:20:37,861 --> 02:20:40,587
[Throws herself on the bed.]

1697
02:20:40,587 --> 02:20:48,075
Scene IV. Hall in Capulet's House. [Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]

1698
02:20:48,075 --> 02:20:51,555
LADY CAPULET Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

1699
02:20:51,555 --> 02:20:54,075
NURSE They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

1700
02:20:54,075 --> 02:20:55,211
[Enter Capulet.]

1701
02:20:55,211 --> 02:20:59,234
CAPULET Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,

1702
02:20:59,234 --> 02:21:05,394
The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:-- Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;

1703
02:21:05,394 --> 02:21:06,538
Spare not for cost.

1704
02:21:06,538 --> 02:21:11,786
NURSE Go, you cot-quean, go, Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow

1705
02:21:11,786 --> 02:21:12,793
For this night's watching.

1706
02:21:12,793 --> 02:21:18,986
CAPULET No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

1707
02:21:18,986 --> 02:21:21,994
LADY CAPULET Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;

1708
02:21:21,994 --> 02:21:27,938
But I will watch you from such watching now. [Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]

1709
02:21:27,938 --> 02:21:31,225
CAPULET A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!--Now, fellow,

1710
02:21:31,225 --> 02:21:36,136
[Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.] What's there?

1711
02:21:36,136 --> 02:21:40,118
1 SERVANT Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

1712
02:21:40,118 --> 02:21:44,214
CAPULET Make haste, make haste. [Exit 1 Servant.]

1713
02:21:44,214 --> 02:21:49,261
--Sirrah, fetch drier logs: Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

1714
02:21:49,261 --> 02:21:52,193
2 SERVANT I have a head, sir, that will find out logs

1715
02:21:52,193 --> 02:21:55,272
And never trouble Peter for the matter. [Exit.]

1716
02:21:55,272 --> 02:21:58,528
CAPULET Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!

1717
02:21:58,528 --> 02:22:04,887
Thou shalt be logger-head.--Good faith, 'tis day. The county will be here with music straight,

1718
02:22:04,887 --> 02:22:09,526
For so he said he would:--I hear him near. [Music within.]

1719
02:22:09,526 --> 02:22:15,086
Nurse!--wife!--what, ho!--what, nurse, I say! [Re-enter Nurse.]

1720
02:22:15,086 --> 02:22:21,382
Go, waken Juliet; go and trim her up; I'll go and chat with Paris:--hie, make haste,

1721
02:22:21,382 --> 02:22:26,259
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: Make haste, I say.

1722
02:22:26,259 --> 02:22:28,035
[Exeunt.]

1723
02:22:28,035 --> 02:22:33,937
Scene V. Juliet's Chamber; Juliet on the bed. [Enter Nurse.]

1724
02:22:33,937 --> 02:22:40,552
NURSE Mistress!--what, mistress!--Juliet!--fast, I warrant her, she:--

1725
02:22:40,552 --> 02:22:52,207
Why, lamb!--why, lady!--fie, you slug-abed!-- Why, love, I say!--madam! sweetheart!--why, bride!--

1726
02:22:52,207 --> 02:23:00,146
What, not a word?--you take your pennyworths now; Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,

1727
02:23:00,146 --> 02:23:06,123
The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me!

1728
02:23:06,123 --> 02:23:16,145
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!--

1729
02:23:16,145 --> 02:23:23,533
Ay, let the county take you in your bed; He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?

1730
02:23:23,533 --> 02:23:33,658
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! I must needs wake you.--lady! lady! lady!--

1731
02:23:33,658 --> 02:23:43,224
Alas, alas!--Help, help! My lady's dead!-- O, well-a-day that ever I was born!--

1732
02:23:43,224 --> 02:23:48,742
Some aqua-vitae, ho!--my lord! my lady! [Enter Lady Capulet.]

1733
02:23:48,742 --> 02:23:50,523
LADY CAPULET What noise is here?

1734
02:23:50,523 --> 02:23:52,474
NURSE O lamentable day!

1735
02:23:52,474 --> 02:23:54,116
LADY CAPULET What is the matter?

1736
02:23:54,116 --> 02:23:57,332
NURSE Look, look! O heavy day!

1737
02:23:57,332 --> 02:24:01,401
LADY CAPULET O me, O me!--my child, my only life!

1738
02:24:01,401 --> 02:24:06,922
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!-- Help, help!--call help.

1739
02:24:06,922 --> 02:24:07,935
[Enter Capulet.]

1740
02:24:07,935 --> 02:24:11,762
CAPULET For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

1741
02:24:11,762 --> 02:24:16,074
NURSE She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead; alack the day!

1742
02:24:16,074 --> 02:24:20,986
LADY CAPULET Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

1743
02:24:20,986 --> 02:24:28,461
CAPULET Ha! let me see her:--out alas! she's cold;

1744
02:24:28,461 --> 02:24:38,874
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; Life and these lips have long been separated:

1745
02:24:38,874 --> 02:24:47,006
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

1746
02:24:47,006 --> 02:24:52,746
Accursed time! unfortunate old man!

1747
02:24:52,746 --> 02:24:55,081
NURSE O lamentable day!

1748
02:24:55,081 --> 02:24:56,922
LADY CAPULET O woful time!

1749
02:24:56,922 --> 02:25:00,650
CAPULET Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,

1750
02:25:00,650 --> 02:25:07,230
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. [Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris, with Musicians.]

1751
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:10,272
FRIAR Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

1752
02:25:10,272 --> 02:25:14,047
CAPULET Ready to go, but never to return:--

1753
02:25:14,047 --> 02:25:23,581
O son, the night before thy wedding day Hath death lain with thy bride:--there she lies,

1754
02:25:23,581 --> 02:25:32,618
Flower as she was, deflowered by him. Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;

1755
02:25:32,618 --> 02:25:41,726
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die. And leave him all; life, living, all is death's.

1756
02:25:41,726 --> 02:25:45,241
PARIS Have I thought long to see this morning's face,

1757
02:25:45,241 --> 02:25:47,983
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

1758
02:25:47,983 --> 02:25:55,505
LADY CAPULET Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

1759
02:25:55,505 --> 02:26:02,565
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,

1760
02:26:02,565 --> 02:26:09,428
But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

1761
02:26:09,428 --> 02:26:14,859
NURSE O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day!

1762
02:26:14,859 --> 02:26:21,346
Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever, I did yet behold!

1763
02:26:21,346 --> 02:26:29,842
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! Never was seen so black a day as this:

1764
02:26:29,842 --> 02:26:32,946
O woeful day! O woeful day!

1765
02:26:32,946 --> 02:26:47,011
PARIS Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,

1766
02:26:47,011 --> 02:26:56,835
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!-- O love! O life!--not life, but love in death!

1767
02:26:56,835 --> 02:27:00,707
CAPULET Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!--

1768
02:27:00,707 --> 02:27:06,907
Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?--

1769
02:27:06,907 --> 02:27:17,450
O child! O child!--my soul, and not my child!-- Dead art thou, dead!--alack, my child is dead;

1770
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:20,704
And with my child my joys are buried!

1771
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:25,900
FRIAR Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not

1772
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:34,884
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,

1773
02:27:34,884 --> 02:27:41,666
And all the better is it for the maid: Your part in her you could not keep from death;

1774
02:27:41,666 --> 02:27:49,393
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. The most you sought was her promotion;

1775
02:27:49,393 --> 02:27:57,258
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd: And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd

1776
02:27:57,258 --> 02:28:06,445
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? O, in this love, you love your child so ill

1777
02:28:06,445 --> 02:28:14,633
That you run mad, seeing that she is well: She's not well married that lives married long:

1778
02:28:14,633 --> 02:28:22,642
But she's best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary

1779
02:28:22,642 --> 02:28:30,538
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church;

1780
02:28:30,538 --> 02:28:38,337
For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

1781
02:28:38,337 --> 02:28:41,145
CAPULET All things that we ordained festival

1782
02:28:41,145 --> 02:28:47,697
Turn from their office to black funeral: Our instruments to melancholy bells;

1783
02:28:47,697 --> 02:28:55,441
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast; Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;

1784
02:28:55,441 --> 02:29:03,382
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary.

1785
02:29:03,382 --> 02:29:07,703
FRIAR Sir, go you in,--and, madam, go with him;--

1786
02:29:07,703 --> 02:29:15,142
And go, Sir Paris;--every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave:

1787
02:29:15,142 --> 02:29:23,902
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill; Move them no more by crossing their high will.

1788
02:29:23,902 --> 02:29:27,296
[Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris, and Friar.]

1789
02:29:27,296 --> 02:29:30,352
1 MUSICIAN Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

1790
02:29:30,352 --> 02:29:37,060
NURSE Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up; For well you know this is a pitiful case.

1791
02:29:37,060 --> 02:29:37,481
[Exit.]

1792
02:29:37,481 --> 02:29:41,914
1 MUSICIAN Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. [Enter Peter.]

1793
02:29:41,914 --> 02:29:46,307
PETER Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease':

1794
02:29:46,307 --> 02:29:50,218
O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

1795
02:29:50,218 --> 02:29:52,283
1 MUSICIAN Why 'Heart's ease'?

1796
02:29:52,283 --> 02:29:56,646
PETER O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is

1797
02:29:56,646 --> 02:30:00,546
full of woe': O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.

1798
02:30:00,546 --> 02:30:04,513
1 MUSICIAN Not a dump we: 'tis no time to play now.

1799
02:30:04,513 --> 02:30:06,088
PETER You will not then?

1800
02:30:06,088 --> 02:30:07,161
1 MUSICIAN No.

1801
02:30:07,161 --> 02:30:09,216
PETER I will then give it you soundly.

1802
02:30:09,216 --> 02:30:10,588
1 MUSICIAN What will you give us?

1803
02:30:10,588 --> 02:30:14,520
PETER No money, on my faith; but the gleek,--I will give you the

1804
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:15,000
minstrel.

1805
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,274
1 MUSICIAN Then will I give you the serving-creature.

1806
02:30:17,274 --> 02:30:27,455
PETER Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, I'll fa you: do you note

1807
02:30:27,455 --> 02:30:27,635
me?

1808
02:30:27,635 --> 02:30:30,244
1 MUSICIAN An you re us and fa us, you note us.

1809
02:30:30,244 --> 02:30:34,593
2 MUSICIAN Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

1810
02:30:34,593 --> 02:30:44,530
PETER Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.--Answer me like men:

1811
02:30:44,530 --> 02:30:52,204
'When griping grief the heart doth wound, And doleful dumps the mind oppress,

1812
02:30:52,204 --> 02:31:00,914
Then music with her silver sound'-- why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver sound'?--

1813
02:31:00,914 --> 02:31:02,800
What say you, Simon Catling?

1814
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:06,626
1 MUSICIAN Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

1815
02:31:06,626 --> 02:31:10,098
PETER Pretty!--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

1816
02:31:10,098 --> 02:31:15,609
2 MUSICIAN I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.

1817
02:31:15,609 --> 02:31:18,706
PETER Pretty too!--What say you, James Soundpost?

1818
02:31:18,706 --> 02:31:21,169
3 MUSICIAN Faith, I know not what to say.

1819
02:31:21,169 --> 02:31:25,474
PETER O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say for you.

1820
02:31:25,474 --> 02:31:32,873
It is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold for sounding:--

1821
02:31:32,873 --> 02:31:39,136
'Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress.'

1822
02:31:39,136 --> 02:31:40,409
[Exit.]

1823
02:31:40,409 --> 02:31:42,704
1 MUSICIAN What a pestilent knave is this same!

1824
02:31:42,704 --> 02:31:47,760
2 MUSICIAN Hang him, Jack!--Come, we'll in here; tarry for the

1825
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:57,350
mourners, and stay dinner. [Exeunt.]

ROMEO AND JULIET by William Shakespeare

1828
02:32:03,354 --> 02:32:07,571
Act V. Scene I. Mantua. A Street.

1829
02:32:07,571 --> 02:32:08,913
[Enter Romeo.]

1830
02:32:08,913 --> 02:32:16,907
ROMEO If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand;

1831
02:32:16,907 --> 02:32:23,921
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit

1832
02:32:23,921 --> 02:32:30,995
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,--

1833
02:32:30,995 --> 02:32:41,704
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!-- And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,

1834
02:32:41,704 --> 02:32:50,400
That I reviv'd, and was an emperor. Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,

1835
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:55,206
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy! [Enter Balthasar.]

1836
02:32:55,206 --> 02:33:01,174
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar? Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?

1837
02:33:01,174 --> 02:33:07,062
How doth my lady? Is my father well? How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;

1838
02:33:07,062 --> 02:33:09,124
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

1839
02:33:09,124 --> 02:33:17,407
BALTHASAR Then she is well, and nothing can be ill: Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,

1840
02:33:17,407 --> 02:33:23,806
And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,

1841
02:33:23,806 --> 02:33:30,950
And presently took post to tell it you: O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,

1842
02:33:30,950 --> 02:33:33,189
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

1843
02:33:33,189 --> 02:33:42,054
ROMEO Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!-- Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,

1844
02:33:42,054 --> 02:33:44,325
And hire post-horses. I will hence to-night. BALTHASAR

1845
02:33:44,325 --> 02:33:51,323
I do beseech you, sir, have patience: Your looks are pale and wild, and do import

1846
02:33:51,323 --> 02:33:52,348
Some misadventure.

1847
02:33:52,348 --> 02:33:57,012
ROMEO Tush, thou art deceiv'd: Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.

1848
02:33:57,012 --> 02:34:00,599
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

1849
02:34:00,599 --> 02:34:02,461
BALTHASAR No, my good lord.

1850
02:34:02,461 --> 02:34:08,356
ROMEO No matter: get thee gone, And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.

1851
02:34:08,356 --> 02:34:14,196
[Exit Balthasar.] Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.

1852
02:34:14,196 --> 02:34:21,435
Let's see for means;--O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!

1853
02:34:21,435 --> 02:34:29,379
I do remember an apothecary,-- And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted

1854
02:34:29,379 --> 02:34:34,836
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,

1855
02:34:34,836 --> 02:34:40,810
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,

1856
02:34:40,810 --> 02:34:45,923
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves

1857
02:34:45,923 --> 02:34:51,508
A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,

1858
02:34:51,508 --> 02:34:56,623
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.

1859
02:34:56,623 --> 02:35:04,953
Noting this penury, to myself I said, An if a man did need a poison now,

1860
02:35:04,953 --> 02:35:10,720
Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.

1861
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:17,624
O, this same thought did but forerun my need; And this same needy man must sell it me.

1862
02:35:17,624 --> 02:35:23,166
As I remember, this should be the house: Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--

1863
02:35:23,166 --> 02:35:27,645
What, ho! apothecary! [Enter Apothecary.]

1864
02:35:27,645 --> 02:35:29,317
APOTHECARY Who calls so loud?

1865
02:35:29,317 --> 02:35:32,283
ROMEO Come hither, man.--I see that thou art poor;

1866
02:35:32,283 --> 02:35:40,027
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have A dram of poison; such soon-speeding gear

1867
02:35:40,027 --> 02:35:44,228
As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker mall fall dead;

1868
02:35:44,228 --> 02:35:48,796
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd

1869
02:35:48,796 --> 02:35:50,528
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

1870
02:35:50,528 --> 02:35:56,355
APOTHECARY Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them.

1871
02:35:56,355 --> 02:35:58,618
ROMEO Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness

1872
02:35:58,618 --> 02:36:05,162
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,

1873
02:36:05,162 --> 02:36:09,826
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back, The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law:

1874
02:36:09,826 --> 02:36:16,882
The world affords no law to make thee rich; Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

1875
02:36:16,882 --> 02:36:19,882
APOTHECARY My poverty, but not my will consents.

1876
02:36:19,882 --> 02:36:22,386
ROMEO I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

1877
02:36:22,386 --> 02:36:24,670
APOTHECARY Put this in any liquid thing you will,

1878
02:36:24,670 --> 02:36:29,528
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.

1879
02:36:29,528 --> 02:36:33,481
ROMEO There is thy gold; worse poison to men's souls,

1880
02:36:33,481 --> 02:36:39,256
Doing more murders in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:

1881
02:36:39,256 --> 02:36:49,047
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. Farewell: buy food and get thyself in flesh.--

1882
02:36:49,047 --> 02:37:00,855
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

1883
02:37:00,855 --> 02:37:02,729
[Exeunt.]

1884
02:37:02,729 --> 02:37:08,599
Scene II. Friar Lawrence's Cell. [Enter Friar John.]

1885
02:37:08,599 --> 02:37:12,124
FRIAR JOHN Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

1886
02:37:12,124 --> 02:37:13,602
[Enter Friar Lawrence.]

1887
02:37:13,602 --> 02:37:20,626
FRIAR LAWRENCE This same should be the voice of Friar John. Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?

1888
02:37:20,626 --> 02:37:23,441
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

1889
02:37:23,441 --> 02:37:29,378
FRIAR JOHN Going to find a barefoot brother out, One of our order, to associate me,

1890
02:37:29,378 --> 02:37:35,017
Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town,

1891
02:37:35,017 --> 02:37:39,919
Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign,

1892
02:37:39,919 --> 02:37:47,184
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

1893
02:37:47,184 --> 02:37:49,337
FRIAR LAWRENCE Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

1894
02:37:49,337 --> 02:37:52,552
FRIAR JOHN I could not send it,--here it is again,--

1895
02:37:52,552 --> 02:37:57,456
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection.

1896
02:37:57,456 --> 02:38:00,879
FRIAR LAWRENCE Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,

1897
02:38:00,879 --> 02:38:06,483
The letter was not nice, but full of charge Of dear import; and the neglecting it

1898
02:38:06,483 --> 02:38:13,462
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence; Get me an iron crow and bring it straight

1899
02:38:13,462 --> 02:38:14,702
Unto my cell.

1900
02:38:14,702 --> 02:38:18,048
FRIAR JOHN Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

1901
02:38:18,048 --> 02:38:18,508
[Exit.]

1902
02:38:18,508 --> 02:38:26,664
FRIAR LAWRENCE Now must I to the monument alone; Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake:

1903
02:38:26,664 --> 02:38:33,496
She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents;

1904
02:38:33,496 --> 02:38:38,894
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;--

1905
02:38:38,894 --> 02:38:45,769
Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb! [Exit.]

1906
02:38:45,769 --> 02:38:51,497
Scene III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.

1907
02:38:51,497 --> 02:38:55,571
[Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.]

1908
02:38:55,571 --> 02:39:05,222
PARIS Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof;-- Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.

1909
02:39:05,222 --> 02:39:13,163
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;

1910
02:39:13,163 --> 02:39:20,795
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,-- Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,--

1911
02:39:20,795 --> 02:39:27,669
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear'st something approach.

1912
02:39:27,669 --> 02:39:32,206
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

1913
02:39:32,206 --> 02:39:39,801
PAGE [Aside.] I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.

1914
02:39:39,801 --> 02:39:40,533
[Retires.]

1915
02:39:40,533 --> 02:39:54,047
PARIS Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew: O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones!

1916
02:39:54,047 --> 02:40:04,693
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew; Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:

1917
02:40:04,693 --> 02:40:12,357
The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

1918
02:40:12,357 --> 02:40:16,184
[The Page whistles.] The boy gives warning something doth approach.

1919
02:40:16,184 --> 02:40:24,644
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night, To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?

1920
02:40:24,644 --> 02:40:31,409
What, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile. [Retires.]

1921
02:40:31,409 --> 02:40:36,606
[Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.]

1922
02:40:36,606 --> 02:40:38,973
ROMEO Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.

1923
02:40:38,973 --> 02:40:45,093
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father.

1924
02:40:45,093 --> 02:40:54,756
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof

1925
02:40:54,756 --> 02:40:59,985
And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death

1926
02:40:59,985 --> 02:41:06,107
Is partly to behold my lady's face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger

1927
02:41:06,107 --> 02:41:14,372
A precious ring,--a ring that I must use In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:--

1928
02:41:14,372 --> 02:41:19,703
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do,

1929
02:41:19,703 --> 02:41:28,907
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:

1930
02:41:28,907 --> 02:41:36,731
The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far

1931
02:41:36,731 --> 02:41:39,078
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

1932
02:41:39,078 --> 02:41:42,223
BALTHASAR I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

1933
02:41:42,223 --> 02:41:52,454
ROMEO So shalt thou show me friendship.--Take thou that: Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

1934
02:41:52,454 --> 02:41:56,325
BALTHASAR For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:

1935
02:41:56,325 --> 02:42:01,038
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [Retires.]

1936
02:42:01,038 --> 02:42:05,818
ROMEO Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,

1937
02:42:05,818 --> 02:42:13,954
Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

1938
02:42:13,954 --> 02:42:21,515
[Breaking open the door of the monument.] And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

1939
02:42:21,515 --> 02:42:24,550
PARIS This is that banish'd haughty Montague

1940
02:42:24,550 --> 02:42:31,651
That murder'd my love's cousin,--with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,--

1941
02:42:31,651 --> 02:42:39,522
And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.--

1942
02:42:39,522 --> 02:42:44,657
[Advances.] Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!

1943
02:42:44,657 --> 02:42:52,294
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee;

1944
02:42:52,294 --> 02:42:55,152
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

1945
02:42:55,152 --> 02:43:02,852
ROMEO I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.-- Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;

1946
02:43:02,852 --> 02:43:10,716
Fly hence and leave me:--think upon these gone; Let them affright thee.--I beseech thee, youth,

1947
02:43:10,716 --> 02:43:15,458
Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury: O, be gone!

1948
02:43:15,458 --> 02:43:22,476
By heaven, I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm'd against myself:

1949
02:43:22,476 --> 02:43:29,686
Stay not, be gone;--live, and hereafter say, A madman's mercy bid thee run away.

1950
02:43:29,686 --> 02:43:32,618
PARIS I do defy thy conjurations,

1951
02:43:32,618 --> 02:43:35,763
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

1952
02:43:35,763 --> 02:43:42,626
ROMEO Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! [They fight.]

1953
02:43:42,626 --> 02:43:45,458
PAGE O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

1954
02:43:45,458 --> 02:43:46,054
[Exit.]

1955
02:43:46,054 --> 02:43:57,208
PARIS O, I am slain! [Falls.] If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

1956
02:43:57,208 --> 02:43:57,844
[Dies.]

1957
02:43:57,844 --> 02:44:09,815
ROMEO In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face:-- Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!--

1958
02:44:09,815 --> 02:44:18,591
What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think

1959
02:44:18,591 --> 02:44:26,407
He told me Paris should have married Juliet: Said he not so? or did I dream it so?

1960
02:44:26,407 --> 02:44:37,188
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,

1961
02:44:37,188 --> 02:44:44,437
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book! I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;--

1962
02:44:44,437 --> 02:44:55,012
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes

1963
02:44:55,012 --> 02:45:04,162
This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.

1964
02:45:04,162 --> 02:45:09,448
[Laying Paris in the monument.] How oft when men are at the point of death

1965
02:45:09,448 --> 02:45:17,346
Have they been merry! which their keepers call A lightning before death: O, how may I

1966
02:45:17,346 --> 02:45:29,466
Call this a lightning?--O my love! my wife! Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,

1967
02:45:29,466 --> 02:45:39,055
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet

1968
02:45:39,055 --> 02:45:45,174
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--

1969
02:45:45,174 --> 02:45:56,768
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favour can I do to thee

1970
02:45:56,768 --> 02:46:03,547
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy?

1971
02:46:03,547 --> 02:46:16,790
Forgive me, cousin!--Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe

1972
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:23,149
That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps

1973
02:46:23,149 --> 02:46:30,081
Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee,

1974
02:46:30,081 --> 02:46:38,693
And never from this palace of dim night Depart again: here, here will I remain

1975
02:46:38,693 --> 02:46:46,856
With worms that are thy chambermaids: O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest;

1976
02:46:46,856 --> 02:46:55,832
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh.--Eyes, look your last!

1977
02:46:55,832 --> 02:47:05,391
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss

1978
02:47:05,391 --> 02:47:14,959
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!-- Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!

1979
02:47:14,959 --> 02:47:21,731
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!

1980
02:47:21,731 --> 02:47:40,084
Here's to my love! [Drinks.]--O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick.--Thus with a kiss I die.

1981
02:47:40,084 --> 02:47:46,459
[Dies.] [Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with

1982
02:47:46,459 --> 02:47:48,005
a lantern, crow, and spade.]

1983
02:47:48,005 --> 02:47:55,431
FRIAR Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?

1984
02:47:55,431 --> 02:47:58,200
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?

1985
02:47:58,200 --> 02:48:02,504
BALTHASAR Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

1986
02:48:02,504 --> 02:48:06,028
FRIAR Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,

1987
02:48:06,028 --> 02:48:12,560
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,

1988
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,332
It burneth in the Capels' monument.

1989
02:48:14,332 --> 02:48:20,154
BALTHASAR It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, One that you love.

1990
02:48:20,154 --> 02:48:21,177
FRIAR Who is it?

1991
02:48:21,177 --> 02:48:22,337
BALTHASAR Romeo.

1992
02:48:22,337 --> 02:48:23,921
FRIAR How long hath he been there?

1993
02:48:23,921 --> 02:48:25,393
BALTHASAR Full half an hour.

1994
02:48:25,393 --> 02:48:27,073
FRIAR Go with me to the vault.

1995
02:48:27,073 --> 02:48:28,977
BALTHASAR I dare not, sir;

1996
02:48:28,977 --> 02:48:34,704
My master knows not but I am gone hence; And fearfully did menace me with death

1997
02:48:34,704 --> 02:48:37,627
If I did stay to look on his intents.

1998
02:48:37,627 --> 02:48:41,786
FRIAR Stay then; I'll go alone:--fear comes upon me;

1999
02:48:41,786 --> 02:48:44,955
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

2000
02:48:44,955 --> 02:48:52,104
BALTHASAR As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought,

2001
02:48:52,104 --> 02:48:54,952
And that my master slew him.

2002
02:48:54,952 --> 02:48:56,849
FRIAR Romeo! [Advances.]

2003
02:48:56,849 --> 02:49:02,872
Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre?--

2004
02:49:02,872 --> 02:49:09,112
What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?

2005
02:49:09,112 --> 02:49:16,664
[Enters the monument.] Romeo! O, pale!--Who else? what, Paris too?

2006
02:49:16,664 --> 02:49:25,057
And steep'd in blood?--Ah, what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance!--The lady stirs.

2007
02:49:25,057 --> 02:49:27,040
[Juliet wakes and stirs.]

2008
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:33,988
JULIET O comfortable friar! where is my lord?-- I do remember well where I should be,

2009
02:49:33,988 --> 02:49:38,260
And there I am:--where is my Romeo? [Noise within.]

2010
02:49:38,260 --> 02:49:42,058
FRIAR I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest

2011
02:49:42,058 --> 02:49:47,982
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: A greater power than we can contradict

2012
02:49:47,982 --> 02:49:54,781
Hath thwarted our intents:--come, come away! Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;

2013
02:49:54,781 --> 02:50:01,802
And Paris too:--come, I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:

2014
02:50:01,802 --> 02:50:10,403
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet [noise within],--I dare no longer stay.

2015
02:50:10,403 --> 02:50:15,135
JULIET Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.--

2016
02:50:15,135 --> 02:50:22,078
[Exit Friar Lawrence.] What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?

2017
02:50:22,078 --> 02:50:30,050
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:-- O churl! drink all, and left no friendly drop

2018
02:50:30,050 --> 02:50:37,250
To help me after?--I will kiss thy lips; Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,

2019
02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:40,938
To make me die with a restorative. [Kisses him.]

2020
02:50:40,938 --> 02:50:43,524
Thy lips are warm!

2021
02:50:43,524 --> 02:50:47,962
1 WATCH [Within.] Lead, boy:--which way?

2022
02:50:47,962 --> 02:50:54,533
JULIET Yea, noise?--Then I'll be brief.--O happy dagger!

2023
02:50:54,533 --> 02:51:04,808
[Snatching Romeo's dagger.] This is thy sheath [stabs herself]; there rest, and let me die.

2024
02:51:04,808 --> 02:51:10,544
[Falls on Romeo's body and dies.] [Enter Watch, with the Page of Paris.]

2025
02:51:10,544 --> 02:51:14,216
PAGE This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

2026
02:51:14,216 --> 02:51:18,472
1 WATCH The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:

2027
02:51:18,472 --> 02:51:22,816
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach. [Exeunt some of the Watch.]

2028
02:51:22,816 --> 02:51:33,119
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain;-- And Juliet bleeding; warm, and newly dead,

2029
02:51:33,119 --> 02:51:40,623
Who here hath lain this two days buried.-- Go, tell the prince;--run to the Capulets,--

2030
02:51:40,623 --> 02:51:45,430
Raise up the Montagues,--some others search:-- [Exeunt others of the Watch.]

2031
02:51:45,430 --> 02:51:50,006
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; But the true ground of all these piteous woes

2032
02:51:50,006 --> 02:51:55,365
We cannot without circumstance descry. [Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.]

2033
02:51:55,365 --> 02:51:59,081
2 WATCH Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

2034
02:51:59,081 --> 02:52:02,974
1 WATCH Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.

2035
02:52:02,974 --> 02:52:05,510
[Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.]

2036
02:52:05,510 --> 02:52:11,146
3 WATCH Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps: We took this mattock and this spade from him

2037
02:52:11,146 --> 02:52:13,668
As he was coming from this churchyard side.

2038
02:52:13,668 --> 02:52:17,464
1 WATCH A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

2039
02:52:17,464 --> 02:52:19,149
[Enter the Prince and Attendants.]

2040
02:52:19,149 --> 02:52:26,381
PRINCE What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning's rest?

2041
02:52:26,381 --> 02:52:28,916
[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and others.]

2042
02:52:28,916 --> 02:52:32,100
CAPULET What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

2043
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:34,236
LADY CAPULET The people in the street cry Romeo,

2044
02:52:34,236 --> 02:52:40,819
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, With open outcry, toward our monument.

2045
02:52:40,819 --> 02:52:44,108
PRINCE What fear is this which startles in our ears?

2046
02:52:44,108 --> 02:52:47,877
1 WATCH Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;

2047
02:52:47,877 --> 02:52:54,563
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill'd.

2048
02:52:54,563 --> 02:52:58,946
PRINCE Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

2049
02:52:58,946 --> 02:53:02,480
1 WATCH Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,

2050
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:06,287
With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs.

2051
02:53:06,287 --> 02:53:11,127
CAPULET O heaven!--O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!

2052
02:53:11,127 --> 02:53:17,040
This dagger hath mista'en,--for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague,--

2053
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:20,850
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

2054
02:53:20,850 --> 02:53:24,133
LADY CAPULET O me! this sight of death is as a bell

2055
02:53:24,133 --> 02:53:28,855
That warns my old age to a sepulchre. [Enter Montague and others.]

2056
02:53:28,855 --> 02:53:32,678
PRINCE Come, Montague; for thou art early up,

2057
02:53:32,678 --> 02:53:36,419
To see thy son and heir more early down.

2058
02:53:36,419 --> 02:53:40,114
MONTAGUE Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;

2059
02:53:40,114 --> 02:53:47,074
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath: What further woe conspires against mine age?

2060
02:53:47,074 --> 02:53:49,722
PRINCE Look, and thou shalt see.

2061
02:53:49,722 --> 02:53:53,729
MONTAGUE O thou untaught! what manners is in this,

2062
02:53:53,729 --> 02:53:55,665
To press before thy father to a grave?

2063
02:53:55,665 --> 02:54:01,846
PRINCE Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities,

2064
02:54:01,846 --> 02:54:09,693
And know their spring, their head, their true descent; And then will I be general of your woes,

2065
02:54:09,693 --> 02:54:17,846
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.--

2066
02:54:17,846 --> 02:54:20,801
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

2067
02:54:20,801 --> 02:54:27,942
FRIAR I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place

2068
02:54:27,942 --> 02:54:36,453
Doth make against me, of this direful murder; And here I stand, both to impeach and purge

2069
02:54:36,453 --> 02:54:40,325
Myself condemned and myself excus'd.

2070
02:54:40,325 --> 02:54:43,260
PRINCE Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

2071
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:46,180
FRIAR I will be brief, for my short date of breath

2072
02:54:46,180 --> 02:54:54,480
Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;

2073
02:54:54,480 --> 02:55:02,459
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: I married them; and their stol'n marriage day

2074
02:55:02,459 --> 02:55:09,160
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;

2075
02:55:09,160 --> 02:55:17,681
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd. You, to remove that siege of grief from her,

2076
02:55:17,681 --> 02:55:24,537
Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce, To County Paris:--then comes she to me,

2077
02:55:24,537 --> 02:55:30,769
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage,

2078
02:55:30,769 --> 02:55:38,975
Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,

2079
02:55:38,975 --> 02:55:44,818
A sleeping potion; which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her

2080
02:55:44,818 --> 02:55:52,848
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night,

2081
02:55:52,848 --> 02:55:59,739
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease.

2082
02:55:59,739 --> 02:56:06,618
But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight

2083
02:56:06,618 --> 02:56:11,545
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking

2084
02:56:11,545 --> 02:56:17,753
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; Meaning to keep her closely at my cell

2085
02:56:17,753 --> 02:56:24,111
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo: But when I came,--some minute ere the time

2086
02:56:24,111 --> 02:56:30,242
Of her awaking,--here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.

2087
02:56:30,242 --> 02:56:36,439
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience:

2088
02:56:36,439 --> 02:56:43,329
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me,

2089
02:56:43,329 --> 02:56:51,165
But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage

2090
02:56:51,165 --> 02:56:58,815
Her nurse is privy: and if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life

2091
02:56:58,815 --> 02:57:05,822
Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law.

2092
02:57:05,822 --> 02:57:08,742
PRINCE We still have known thee for a holy man.--

2093
02:57:08,742 --> 02:57:12,789
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

2094
02:57:12,789 --> 02:57:15,749
BALTHASAR I brought my master news of Juliet's death;

2095
02:57:15,749 --> 02:57:21,766
And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument.

2096
02:57:21,766 --> 02:57:29,181
This letter he early bid me give his father; And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,

2097
02:57:29,181 --> 02:57:32,956
If I departed not, and left him there.

2098
02:57:32,956 --> 02:57:35,203
PRINCE Give me the letter,--I will look on it.--

2099
02:57:35,203 --> 02:57:41,437
Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?-- Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

2100
02:57:41,437 --> 02:57:46,260
BOY He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;

2101
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:53,972
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did: Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;

2102
02:57:53,972 --> 02:58:01,267
And by-and-by my master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the watch.

2103
02:58:01,267 --> 02:58:04,075
PRINCE This letter doth make good the friar's words,

2104
02:58:04,075 --> 02:58:11,019
Their course of love, the tidings of her death: And here he writes that he did buy a poison

2105
02:58:11,019 --> 02:58:19,634
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.--

2106
02:58:19,634 --> 02:58:27,977
Where be these enemies?--Capulet,--Montague,-- See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,

2107
02:58:27,977 --> 02:58:36,074
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too,

2108
02:58:36,074 --> 02:58:40,417
Have lost a brace of kinsmen:--all are punish'd.

2109
02:58:40,417 --> 02:58:48,640
CAPULET O brother Montague, give me thy hand: This is my daughter's jointure, for no more

2110
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:49,494
Can I demand.

2111
02:58:49,494 --> 02:58:55,176
MONTAGUE But I can give thee more: For I will raise her statue in pure gold;

2112
02:58:55,176 --> 02:59:01,160
That while Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set

2113
02:59:01,160 --> 02:59:05,224
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

2114
02:59:05,224 --> 02:59:08,832
CAPULET As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;

2115
02:59:08,832 --> 02:59:11,275
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

2116
02:59:11,275 --> 02:59:18,751
PRINCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head.

2117
02:59:18,751 --> 02:59:26,819
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;

2118
02:59:26,819 --> 02:59:33,467
For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

2119
02:59:33,467 --> 02:59:41,850
[Exeunt.]

2120
02:59:41,850 --> 99:59:59,999

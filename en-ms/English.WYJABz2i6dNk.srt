1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Why do so many people reach success and then fail?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So we do everything that leads up to success,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but then we get there. We figure we've made it,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we sit back in our comfort zone,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I can tell you this happens,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because it happened to me.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can just sit back and relax."

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't need to improve any more."

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the only thing that came was creative block.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I couldn't come up with any ideas.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Reaching success, I always focused  on clients and projects,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and ignored the money.  Then all this money started pouring in.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I got distracted by it.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
when I should have been talking to my clients.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But then I got into stuff that I didn't love,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
like management. I am the world's worst manager,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the president of the company.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and here I was, outwardly very successful,

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but inwardly very depressed.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I bought a fast car.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
(Laughter)

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It didn't help.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I was faster but just as depressed.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But money can't buy happiness."

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And he put me on anti-depressants.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
(Laughter)

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And clients didn't call.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
(Laughter)

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Because they could see I was no longer serving them,

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was only serving myself.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And that was great.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I went back to doing the projects I loved.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
did all the things that took me back up to success.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But it wasn't a quick trip.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It took seven years.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And when I went back to following these eight principles,

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I woke up one day and I said,

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
"I don't need Prozac anymore."

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's a continuous journey.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we just keep following these eight principles,

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
because that is not only how we achieve success,

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it's how we sustain it.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So here is to your continued success.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you very much.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
(Applause)

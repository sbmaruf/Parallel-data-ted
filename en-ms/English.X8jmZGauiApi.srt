00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,330
In the first video on evolution,
I gave the example

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,170
of the peppered moth during the
Industrial Revolution in

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,630
England and how, before the
Industrial Revolution, there

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,920
were a bunch of moths: some were
dark, some were light,

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,910
some were in between.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,309
But then once everything became
soot filled, all of a

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,160
sudden, the dark moths were less
likely to be caught by

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,260
predators and so all of the
white moths were less likely

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,060
to be able to reproduce
successfully, so the black

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,140
moth trait, or that variant,
dominated.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,600
And then if you came a little
bit later and you saw all the

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,850
moths had turned black,
you'd say all

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,070
these moths are geniuses.

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,760
They appear to have somehow
engineered their way to stay

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,680
camouflaged.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,060
And the point I was making
there is that, look, that

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,060
wasn't engineered or an explicit
move on the part of

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,090
the moths or the DNA, that was
just a natural byproduct of

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,000
them having some variation, and
some of that variation was

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,080
selected for.

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,850
So that example, that was pretty
simple: black or white.

23
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,200
But what about more complicated
things?

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
So, for example, here I've got a
couple of pictures of what's

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,319
commonly called the
owl butterfly.

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,790
And what's amazing here, and
it's pretty obvious, as I

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,750
probably don't have to point out
to you, is its wing looks

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,370
like half of an owl's eye.

29
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,980
I can almost draw a beak here
and draw another wing there

30
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,400
and you can imagine an owl
staring at us, right?

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,310
And here, too, I could imagine
a beak here and you would

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,170
think an owl there, too.

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,880
And so the question is how does
something this good show

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,890
up randomly, right?

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,840
I mean, you could imagine, OK,
little spots or black and

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,630
white or grey, but how does
something that looks so much

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,360
like an eye generate randomly?

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,430
Now the answer is-- well,
there's a couple of answers.

39
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,820
One is why does this eye
exist, or this eye-like

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,960
pattern or this owl-like
eye's pattern?

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,500
And there, the jury's
still out on that.

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,270
I read a little bit about it on
Wikipedia and all of these

43
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,540
images I got from Wikipedia.

44
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,950
In Wikipedia, they said,
look, there's two

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,970
competing theories here.

46
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,060
One theory is that this, even
though to us humans, the way

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,690
we see things, it looks like
an owl's eye, that this is

48
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,830
actually a decoy.

49
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:16,610
When some predator wants to eat
one of these things, they

50
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,870
go for the thing that looks
most substantive.

51
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,000
So instead of going for the
butterfly's body, which

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,350
doesn't look that substantive,
they go for

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,250
the big, black thing.

54
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,330
They say, oh, that looks like
it's protein rich and it'll be

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,160
a good meal.

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,310
So they try to snap and bite at
that, and if they bite at

57
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,440
that, sure, the guy's wing's
going to be clipped a little

58
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,840
bit and it's going to suck,
but the animal itself, the

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,540
actual butterfly, would survive,
and maybe it can

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,320
repair its swings.

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,110
I don't know the actual biology
of the owl butterfly.

62
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,710
That's one theory, and then the
argument against it goes,

63
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,090
well, no, if that was the case,
then you would want the

64
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,070
black spot even further back
along its-- you'd want the

65
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,980
spot way far away
from the body.

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,280
You'd want it back here instead
of right here, because

67
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,540
there's still a chance, if
something chomps at this

68
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,780
little black spot, that
it'll still get the

69
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,750
abdomen of the butterfly.

70
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,160
Now, the other theory as to
why this exists-- and, you

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,710
know, who knows?

72
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,870
Maybe it's a little
bit of both.

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,000
Maybe both of these are true.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,960
Maybe this offers
two advantages.

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,510
The other theory, and this is
kind of the one that jumps out

76
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,780
at us when we see this , is,
hey, this looks like an owl.

77
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,980
Maybe this is to scare away the
things that are likely to

78
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,400
eat this dude.

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,440
And it does turn out in my
reading that there are lizards

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,120
that like to eat these type of
butterflies, and those lizards

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,470
probably don't like to be around
birds or owls because

82
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,780
those owls eat them, so that
might be a deterrent.

83
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,360
And then the other example, they
said is, look, they tend

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,370
to be eaten by this lizard
right here-- this is what

85
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,740
Wikipedia told me-- and that
this lizard tends to be eaten

86
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,850
by this frog right there, and
that the eyes of this

87
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,660
butterfly are not too
dissimilar to the

88
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,070
eyes of this frog.

89
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,080
And, you know, we can debate
whether or not that's the

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,050
case, and if this was the
predator we're trying to

91
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,350
mimic, you could make an
argument that maybe we would

92
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,620
have had more green on our wing,
but that's not the point

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,210
of this video.

94
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,540
But it's a fun discussion to
have as to what is useful

95
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,140
about this eye.

96
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,270
But let's have the question: How
did that eye come about?

97
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,350
And when I say that eye, I mean
the pattern on that wing.

98
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,980
What set of events allowed
this to happen?

99
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,709
Because when I described
evolution, and we know that

100
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,610
everything in our biological
kingdom is just a set of

101
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,540
proteins and then stuff that
maybe the protein-- but mainly

102
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,920
protein, and that protein's
all coded for by DNA.

103
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm going to do future videos
on DNA, but DNA is just a

104
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,690
sequence of base pairs.

105
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,420
It's a sequence of
these molecules.

106
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,630
And we represent adenine,
and guanine and

107
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,910
cytosine and thymine.

108
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,460
Then maybe you have a couple of
adenines in a row and some

109
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,760
guanine and thymine.

110
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,840
I'll do a lot more on this in
the future, but the idea is

111
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,580
it's just coded for by this
sequence of these molecules.

112
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,010
How do you go from a butterfly
that has no eye to all of a

113
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,100
sudden an eye that goes there?

114
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,470
Obviously, just one change
that happens

115
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,570
from a random mutation.

116
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,380
Maybe that G turns into an A or
maybe this C and this T get

117
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,650
deleted so everything-- that
alone isn't going to develop

118
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,580
this beautiful of a pattern or
this useful of a pattern.

119
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,880
So how do the random
changes explain

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,030
something that's this intricate?

121
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,190
And this is my explanation.

122
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,840
And obviously, I wasn't sitting
there watching over

123
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,420
the thousands or millions of
years as these owl butterflies

124
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,520
emerged, so this is just my
theory of how natural

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,330
selection does explain this
type of phenomenon.

126
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,780
You have a world where in some
environment you have

127
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,980
butterflies, and their wings
look like-- let's say you have

128
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,930
some butterflies that are
generally like this.

129
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,006
That's their wing, and it's a
very bad drawing, but I think

130
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:44,290
you get the idea, and there's
just some general patterns.

131
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,170
We've seen it before.

132
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,080
There's variation.

133
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,220
And the variation does show up
from these little random

134
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,390
changes in DNA.

135
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,920
I think we can all believe
that, that most of these

136
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,180
changes are kind of benign.

137
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,150
Maybe they just set up
differently where a little

138
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,730
pattern will show up or a little
speck of pigment will

139
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,630
show up with a slightly
different color.

140
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,470
And we even see amongst
these owl

141
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,030
butterflies, there is variation.

142
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,670
This dude's wing is different
than that guy's wing with the

143
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,040
commonality that they do have
these eye-looking shapes.

144
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
And there's not just one;
there's actually multiple.

145
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,610
This guy has this other thing
up here that looks

146
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,110
interesting, and they have
multiple things, but the one

147
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,830
really noticeable feature is
this eye-looking thing.

148
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,400
So how do we go from this
to an eye-looking thing?

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,080
So the idea is you have
some variation.

150
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,070
One guy might look like that.

151
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:33,630
Another guy, or gal, might--
just randomly, their dot might

152
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,410
be something like that.

153
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,520
Another gal or guy-- these wings
are really badly drawn,

154
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,730
but you get the idea.

155
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,450
This is the butterfly.

156
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,670
This is its antenna
right there.

157
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,290
That's its body.

158
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,850
Another butterfly's patterns
might look like this, right?

159
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,640
And so, they're just random.

160
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,760
But when they go into a certain
environment for

161
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,250
whatever reason, maybe one of
its predators-- maybe that

162
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,190
theory that these are supposed
to look like eyes is true.

163
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,750
And so, actually, maybe
this guy just has a

164
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,120
random pattern here.

165
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,830
And so this guy-- and I'm not
saying that it's like

166
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,980
definitely better.

167
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,080
They're both going to be found
and killed by predators, but

168
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,380
it's all probablistic, right?

169
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,270
Maybe this guy has a 1% less
chance of getting a predator,

170
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,475
because when a predator just
looks at him out of the corner

171
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:28,220
of that eye, that little really
hazy region kind of

172
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,470
looks like an eye and the
predator would be better off

173
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,480
just not messing with it, and
they'd rather go after the

174
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,740
dude that looks like this.

175
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,670
So it's just a slight
probability.

176
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,520
Now, you might, say, OK,
what's 1% going to do?

177
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,990
But when you compound that 1%
over thousands and thousands

178
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,930
of generations, all of a sudden,
this trait might

179
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,590
dominate because he's just going
to be killed that less

180
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,680
frequently, 1% less
frequently.

181
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,220
Now, maybe this guy has a
similar trait, but his spot is

182
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,430
closer to the abdomen.

183
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,010
And here, it's a tradeoff,
because maybe some predators

184
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,950
get scared away by this
concentration of pigment.

185
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,310
And once again, I'm not saying
that we're here yet.

186
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,920
We're not at this very advanced,
sophisticated

187
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,460
pattern yet.

188
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,070
We're at this random
concentration of pigment that

189
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,000
just shows up.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,570
So we see that people who have
this concentration of pigment

191
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,050
further away from their
abdomen, they do well.

192
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,330
But when it's too close, maybe
some predators think that

193
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,290
that's actually an insect and
they want to eat it, so that's

194
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,640
actually a bad trait.

195
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,420
So what happens is this guy
dominates, and so within this

196
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,470
population, you start having a
lot of variation, because he

197
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,620
starts representing--
he's more likely to

198
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,789
pass on these traits.

199
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,340
And I want to make that
point very clear.

200
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,049
This isn't what happens
over the course

201
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,440
of an animal's lifetime.

202
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,100
It's not like if somehow I
experience something, or at

203
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,970
least our current theory if I
experience something, that I

204
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,920
could somehow pass on that
knowledge to my child.

205
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,570
What it says is if my DNA just
happens to have just some

206
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,690
variation that happens to be
more useful or more likely for

207
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,540
me to survive to reproduction
and for my children to

208
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,660
survive, then that will start to
dominate in the population.

209
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,490
So then the population, you're
going to have variations

210
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,750
within that.

211
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,345
Maybe some guys, you know, it's
going to get a little bit

212
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:10,520
to look like that.

213
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,070
Maybe another one's going to
look a little bit like that.

214
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,400
Maybe it has some spots there.

215
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,190
You can kind of view it as the
variation as "exploring." But

216
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,680
I want to be very clear not to
use any active verbs here

217
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,630
because this is all being done
really as almost a common

218
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,690
sense process, where
everything changes.

219
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,890
The changes that are most suited
are the ones that are

220
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,350
going to survive more
frequently.

221
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,360
And then the next generation's
going to have more of that and

222
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,550
then you'll have variation
within that change.

223
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,500
And then this one might
be like that, and

224
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,270
maybe this is the one.

225
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,540
These were good compared to
that, but now when you're

226
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,660
competing amongst themselves,
this one is able to reproduce

227
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,410
1% more than this
guy or this guy.

228
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,240
And so this guy becomes-- and
maybe it's some combination of

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,520
all of the above, and
they mix and match.

230
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,620
It's a hugely complex system.

231
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,360
But then this guy represents
most of the population, when I

232
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,790
say this guy, I'm saying this
guy's genetic information, at

233
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,060
least as it pertains
to his wings.

234
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,850
And then you get variation
amongst that.

235
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,790
Maybe some of it, they have a
little small dot and there's

236
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,830
some dots around it.

237
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,110
Maybe it's like this.

238
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,630
Maybe one of them digresses and
goes back here, but then

239
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,890
he has trouble competing so
he gets knocked out again.

240
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,060
And then some other people
have it back here.

241
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,660
I think you get the
point that this

242
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,920
isn't happening overnight.

243
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,310
These changes can be fairly
incremental, but we're doing

244
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,330
it over thousands
of generations.

245
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,590
So when you're talking about
thousands of generations, or

246
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,600
even millions of generations,
even a 1% advantage can be

247
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,450
significant, and when you
accumulate those variations

248
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,340
over a large period of time,
you can get to fairly

249
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,550
intricate patterns like this.

250
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,960
So I just wanted to explain
that, because this is often

251
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,820
used as, sure, I can believe
the butterfly moth or I can

252
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,310
even maybe believe the examples
of the antibiotics

253
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,290
and the bacteria or the flu,
because those are kind of

254
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,130
real-time examples.

255
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,950
But how does something this
intricate show up?

256
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,280
And I actually want to
make a point here.

257
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,430
We think this is more intricate
because we can

258
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,410
relate to it in our
everyday lives.

259
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,500
But if you actually look at a
structure of a bacteria and

260
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,860
how it operates or what a virus
does to infiltrate an

261
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,830
immune system or a cell, that's
actually on a lot more

262
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,680
levels a lot more intricate
than a design.

263
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,770
In fact, the whole reason why
I'm using this as an example

264
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,130
is because this is a fairly
simple example as opposed to

265
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,300
kind of explaining the
metabolism of a certain type

266
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,500
of bacteria and how that might
change and how it might become

267
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,510
immune to penicillin
or whatever else.

268
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,840
But I want to make this very
clear that these very

269
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,210
intricate things, they don't
happen overnight.

270
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:45,410
It's not like one butterfly
was completely one uniform

271
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,080
hot-pink color and then all of
a sudden they have a child

272
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,820
whose wings looked
just like this.

273
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,120
No!

274
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,500
It happens over large periods of
time, although there might

275
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,880
be some little weird hormonal
change that does this, but I'm

276
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,740
not going to go there,
but that is possible.

277
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,570
But I just wanted to make this
point because I think the more

278
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,630
examples we see, the more it'll
kind of hit home that

279
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,900
this is a passive process.

280
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,100
We're not talking about these
things happening overnight.

281
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,070
And it's actually really
interesting to look at our

282
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,070
world around us and look at
ecosystems as they are today

283
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,040
and try to think really hard
about how something came to

284
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,580
be, what it's useful for,
why it might have

285
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,630
been selected for.

286
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:27,430
For example, are traits that
occur after reproduction

287
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,070
selected for?

288
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,860
Well, probably not unless they
affect the reproduction of the

289
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,600
next cycle.

290
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,220
For example, you might say,
oh, well, the trait to be

291
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,590
nurturing after your
reproductive years, that's

292
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,620
after reproductive years.

293
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,460
No, but it helps your
offspring reproduce.

294
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,030
But we already see a lot of
diseases, especially once we

295
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,800
get beyond our reproductive and
our child-rearing years.

296
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,280
So once we get into our fifties
and sixties, the

297
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,120
incidences of diseases increases
exponentially from

298
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,940
when we're younger and because
they're no longer being

299
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,020
selected for, because it no
longer affects our ability to

300
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,890
reproduce, because we've
already reproduced.

301
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,220
We've already raised
our children so

302
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,330
that they could reproduce.

303
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,140
So the only thing that happens
at that point is now not being

304
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,000
selected for.

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,790
So anyway, hopefully, this video
will give you a little

306
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,160
bit more nuance on evolution,
and I want to do a couple of

307
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,670
videos like this, because I
really want to make it clear

308
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,510
that it's not making some wild
claim that all of a sudden

309

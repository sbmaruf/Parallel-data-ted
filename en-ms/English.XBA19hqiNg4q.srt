00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,575
Welcome to my presentation
on equivalent fractions.

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:08,600
So equivalent fractions are essentially what they sound like

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,640
They're two fractions that
although they use different

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,260
numbers, they actually
represent the same thing.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,930
Let me show you an example.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,306
Let's say I had
the fraction 1/2.

7
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:21,060
Why isn't it writing.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,480
Let me make sure I get
the right color here.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,930
Let's say I had
the fraction 1/2.

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,960
So graphically, if we to draw
that, if I had a pie and I

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,030
would have cut it
into two pieces.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,590
That's the denominator
there, 2.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,420
And then if I were to eat
1 of the 2 pieces I would

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,240
have eaten 1/2 of this pie.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,150
Makes sense.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,170
Nothing too complicated there.

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,900
Well, what if instead of
dividing the pie into two

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,040
pieces, let me just draw
that same pie again.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,030
Instead of dividing it in two
pieces, what if I divided

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,200
that pie into 4 pieces?

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,870
So here in the denominator I
have a possibility of-- total

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,680
of 4 pieces in the pie.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,030
And instead of eating one
piece, this time I actually

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,135
ate 2 of the 4 pieces.

25
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:13,140
Or I ate 2/4 of the pie.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,240
Well if we look at these two
pictures, we can see that

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,230
I've eaten the same
amount of the pie.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,780
So these fractions
are the same thing.

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,170
If someone told you that they
ate 1/2 of a pie or if they

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,410
told you that they ate 2/4 of a
pie, it turns out of that they

31
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,640
ate the same amount of pie.

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,490
So that's why we're saying
those two fractions

33
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,460
are equivalent.

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,820
Another way, if we actually
had-- let's do another one.

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,770
Let's say-- and that pie is
quite ugly, but let's assume

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,550
it's the same type of pie.

37
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,250
Let's say we divided
that pie into 8 pieces.

38
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,840
And now, instead of eating 2
we ate 4 of those 8 pieces.

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,360
So we ate 4 out of 8 pieces.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,140
Well, we still ended up eating
the same amount of the pie.

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,080
We ate half of the pie.

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,790
So we see that 1/2 will equal
2/4, and that equals 4/8.

43
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,320
Now do you see a pattern here
if we just look at the

44
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,540
numerical relationships
between 1/2, 2/4, and 4/8?

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,640
Well, to go from 1/2 to 2/4 we
multiply the denominator-- the

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,310
denominator just as review is
the number on the bottom

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,170
of the fraction.

48
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,020
We multiply the
denominator by 2.

49
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,370
And when you multiply the
denominator by 2, we also

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,250
multiply the numerator by 2.

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,360
We did the same thing here.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
And that makes sense because
well, if I double the number of

53
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,640
pieces in the pie, then I have
to eat twice as many pieces to

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,700
eat the same amount of pie.

55
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,390
Let's do some more examples
of equivalent fractions

56
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,740
and hopefully it'll
hit the point home.

57
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,020
Let me erase this.

58
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,550
Why isn't it letting me erase?

59
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:14,030
Let me use the regular mouse.

60
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,620
OK, good.

61
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,750
Sorry for that.

62
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,985
So let's say I had
the fraction 3/5.

63
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:24,160
Well, by the same principle,
as long as we multiply the

64
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,250
numerator and the denominator
by the same numbers, we'll

65
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,740
get an equivalent fraction.

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,230
So if we multiply the numerator
times 7 and the denominator

67
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:46,820
times 7, we'll get 21-- because
3 times 7 is 21-- over 35.

68
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,790
And so 3/5 and 21/35 are
equivalent fractions.

69
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,880
And we essentially, and I don't
know if you already know how to

70
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,830
multiply fractions, but all we
did is we multiplied 3/5

71
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,460
times 7/7 to get 21/35.

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,480
And if you look at this, what
we're doing here isn't magic.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,090
7/7, well what's 7/7?

74
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,700
If I had 7 pieces in a pie
and I were to eat 7 of

75
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,850
them; I ate the whole pie.

76
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,160
So 7/7, this is the
same thing as 1.

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,620
So all we've essentially
said is well, 3/5 and we

78
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,970
multiplied it times 1.

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,910
Which is the same thing as 7/7.

80
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,490
Oh boy, this thing
is messing up.

81
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,660
And that's how we got 21/35.

82
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,180
So it's interesting.

83
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,090
All we did is multiply the
number by 1 and we know

84
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,690
that any number times 1
is still that number.

85
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,940
And all we did is we figured
out a different way

86
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:54,150
of writing 21/35.

87
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,930
Let's start with
a fraction 5/12.

88
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,070
And I wanted to write that with
the denominator-- let's say I

89
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,290
wanted to write that with
the denominator 36.

90
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,050
Well, to go from 12 to 36, what
do we have to multiply by?

91
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,530
Well 12 goes into
36 three times.

92
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,830
So if we multiply the
denominator by 3, we also have

93
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,450
to multiply the numerator by 3.

94
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,215
Times 3.

95
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:27,080
We get 15.

96
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,890
So we get 15/36 is the
same thing as 5/12.

97
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,380
And just going to our original
example, all that's saying

98
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,300
is, if I had a pie with 12
pieces and I ate 5 of them.

99
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,140
Let's say I did that.

100
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,990
And then you had a pie, the
same size pie, you had a

101
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,740
pie with 36 pieces and
you ate 15 of them.

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,540
Then we actually ate the
same amount of pie.

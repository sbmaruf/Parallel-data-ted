1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,500
Well now you've learned what I
think is quite possibly one of

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,010
the most useful concepts in
life, and you might already be

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,920
familiar with it, but if you're
not this will hopefully keep

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,330
you from one day filing
for bankruptcy.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,830
So anyway, I will talk about
interest, and then simple

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,865
versus compound interest.

7
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:23,770
So what's interest?

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,840
We all have heard of it.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,030
Interest rates, or interest
on your mortgage, or how

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,240
much interest do I owe
on my credit card.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,140
So interest-- I don't know what
the actual formal definition,

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,610
maybe I should look it up
on Wikipedia-- but it's

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,850
essentially rent on money.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,350
So it's money that you pay
in order to keep money

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,520
for some period of time.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,420
That's probably not the most
obvious definition, but

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,920
let me put it this way.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's say that I want to
borrow $100 from you.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,760
So this is now.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,120
And let's say that this
is one year from now.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,080
One year.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,830
And this is you,
and this is me.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,580
So now you give me $100.

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,915
And then I have the $100
and a year goes by,

25
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:12,570
and I have $100 here.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,980
And if I were to just give you
that $100 back, you would

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,510
have collected no rent.

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,470
You would have just
got your money back.

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,880
You would have
collected no interest.

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,470
But if you said, Sal I'm
willing to give you $100 now if

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,860
you give me $110 a year later.

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,620
So in this situation, how
much did I pay you to keep

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,620
that $100 for a year?

34
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,200
Well I'm paying you
$10 more, right?

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,610
I'm returning the $100, and
I'm returning another $10.

36
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,510
And so this extra $10 that I'm
returning to you is essentially

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,570
the fee that I paid to be able
to keep that money and do

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,790
whatever I wanted with that
money, and maybe save

39
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,630
it, maybe invest it, do
whatever for a year.

40
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,200
And that $10 is
essentially the interest.

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,530
And a way that it's often
calculated is a percentage

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,850
of the original amount
that I borrowed.

43
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,140
And the original amount that I
borrowed in fancy banker or

44
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,980
finance terminology is
just called principal.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,630
So in this case the rent on the
money or the interest was $10.

46
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,920
And if I wanted to do it as a
percentage, I would say 10 over

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,240
the principal-- over 100--
which is equal to 10%.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,480
So you might have said, hey Sal
I'm willing to lend you $100 if

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,420
you pay me 10% interest on it.

50
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,770
So 10% of $100 was $10, so
after a year I pay you

51
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,810
$100, plus the 10%.

52
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,560
And likewise.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,220
So for any amount of money, say
you're willing to lend me any

54
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,540
amount of money for
a 10% interest.

55
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,680
Well then if you were to lend
me $1,000, then the interest

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,950
would be 10% of that,
which would be $100.

57
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:11,020
So then after a year I would
owe you $1,000 plus 10% times

58
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,555
$1,000, and that's
equal to $1,100.

59
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:17,780
All right, I just added
a zero to everything.

60
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,090
In this case $100 would
be the interest, but

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,130
it would still be 10%.

62
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,170
So let me now make a
distinction between simple

63
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,000
interest and compound interest.

64
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,220
So we just did a fairly simple
example where you lent money

65
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,540
for me for a year at
10% percent, right?

66
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,280
So let's say that someone were
to say that my interest rate

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,930
that they charge-- or the
interest rate they charge to

68
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:51,000
other people-- is-- well 10% is
a good number-- 10% per year.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,700
And let's say the principal
that I'm going to borrow

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,900
from this person is $100.

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,980
So my question to you-- and
maybe you want to pause it

72
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:18,570
after I pose it-- is how
much do I owe in 10 years?

73
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,140
How much do I owe in 10 years?

74
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,080
So there's really two ways
of thinking about it.

75
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,350
You could say, OK in years at
times zero-- like if I just

76
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,430
borrowed the money, I just
paid it back immediately,

77
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,730
it'd be $100, right?

78
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,210
I'm not going to do that,
I'm going to keep it

79
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,570
for at least a year.

80
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,270
So after a year, just based on
the example that we just did, I

81
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:48,870
could add 10% of that amount to
the $100, and I would

82
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,050
then owe $110.

83
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,420
And then after two years, I
could add another 10% of the

84
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,800
original principal, right?

85
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,610
So every year I'm
just adding $10.

86
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,775
So in this case it would be
$120, and in year three,

87
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,310
I would owe $130.

88
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,770
Essentially my rent per year to
borrow this $100 is $10, right?

89
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,580
Because I'm always taking
10% of the original amount.

90
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,090
And after 10 years-- because
each year I would have had to

91
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,120
pay an extra $10 in interest--
after 10 years I

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,630
would owe $200.

93
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,200
Right?

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:33,520
And that $200 is equal to $100
of principal, plus $100 of

95
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,580
interest, because I paid
$10 a year of interest.

96
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,260
And this notion which I just
did here, this is actually

97
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,020
called simple interest.

98
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,260
Which is essentially you take
the original amount you

99
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,840
borrowed, the interest rate,
the amount, the fee that you

100
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,140
pay every year is the interest
rate times that original

101
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,090
amount, and you just
incrementally pay

102
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,380
that every year.

103
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,980
But if you think about it,
you're actually paying a

104
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,390
smaller and smaller percentage
of what you owe going

105
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,170
into that year.

106
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,950
And maybe when I show
you compound interest

107
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,690
that will make sense.

108
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,530
So this is one way to interpret
10% interest a year.

109
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,960
Another way to interpret it is,
OK, so in year zero it's $100

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,840
that you're borrowing, or if
they handed the money, you say

111
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,230
oh no, no, I don't want it and
you just paid it back,

112
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,550
you'd owe $100.

113
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,630
After a year, you would
essentially pay the

114
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,450
$100 plus 10% of $100,
right, which is $110.

115
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,830
So that's $100,
plus 10% of $100.

116
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,180
Let me switch colors,
because it's monotonous.

117
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,970
Right, but I think this
make sense to you.

118
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,030
And this is where simple
and compound interest

119
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,220
starts to diverge.

120
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,930
In the last situation we
just kept adding 10%

121
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,480
of the original $100.

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,310
In compound interest now,
we don't take 10% of

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,310
the original amount.

124
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,310
We now take 10% of this amount.

125
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,440
So now we're going
to take $110.

126
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,470
You can almost view it
as our new principal.

127
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,840
This is how much we offer
a year, and then we

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,110
would reborrow it.

129
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:19,810
So now we're going to owe
$110 plus 10% times 110.

130
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,220
You could actually undistribute
the 110 out, and that's

131
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:32,950
equal to 110 times 110.

132
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,440
Actually 110 times 1.1.

133
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,280
And actually I could
rewrite it this way too.

134
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,850
I could rewrite it as
100 times 1.1 squared,

135
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,920
and that equals $121.

136
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,790
And then in year two, this is
my new principal-- this is

137
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,110
$121-- this is my
new principal.

138
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,990
And now I have to in year
three-- so this is year two.

139
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,710
I'm taking more space,
so this is year two.

140
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,450
And now in year three, I'm
going to have to pay the $121

141
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:14,820
that I owed at the end of year
two, plus 10% times the amount

142
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,450
of money I owed going
into the year, $121.

143
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,950
And so that's the same thing--
we could put parentheses around

144
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:29,270
here-- so that's the same thing
as 1 times 121 plus 0.1 times

145
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:35,650
121, so that's the same
thing as 1.1 times 121.

146
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,800
Or another way of viewing it,
that's equal to our original

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,180
principal times 1.1
to the third power.

148
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,060
And if you keep doing this--
and I encourage you do it,

149
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,660
because it'll really give you a
hands-on sense-- at the end of

150
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,030
10 years, we will owe-- or you,
I forgot who's borrowing from

151
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,962
whom-- $100 times 1.1
to the 10th power.

152
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,050
And what does that equal?

153
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,320
Let me get my spreadsheet out.

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,690
Let me just pick a random cell.

155
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:10,980
So plus 100 times 1.1
to the 10th power.

156
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,160
So $259 and some change.

157
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,730
So it might seem like a very
subtle distinction, but it ends

158
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,580
up being a very big difference.

159
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,610
When I compounded it 10% for
10 years using compound

160
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,100
interest, I owe $259.

161
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,290
When I did it using simple
interest, I only owe $200.

162
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,770
So that $59 was kind of the
increment of how much more

163
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,360
compound interest cost me.

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm about to run out of time,
so I'll do a couple more

165
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,560
examples in the next video,
just you really get a deep

166
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,460
understanding of how to do
compound interest, how the

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,680
exponents work, and what
really is the difference.

168
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,060
I'll see you in the next video.

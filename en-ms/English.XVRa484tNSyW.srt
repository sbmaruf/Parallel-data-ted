1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,594
So quadrilateral ABCD, they're
telling us it is a rhombus,

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:06,260
and what we need to
do, we need to prove

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,120
that the area of this rhombus is
equal to 1/2 times AC times BD.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,040
So we're essentially proving
that the area of a rhombus

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,970
is 1/2 times the product of
the lengths of its diagonals.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,020
So let's see what
we can do over here.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,800
So there's a bunch of
things we know about rhombi

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,370
and all rhombi are
parallelograms,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,920
so there's tons of things that
we know about parallelograms.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,980
First of all, if it's a rhombus,
we know that all of the sides

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,080
are congruent.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,390
So that side length is
equal to that side length is

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,460
equal to that side length is
equal to that side length.

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,500
Because it's a
parallelogram, we know

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,530
the diagonals bisect each other.

17
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,145
So we know that
this length-- let

18
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,370
me call this point
over here B, let's

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,130
call this E. We know that BE
is going to be equal to ED.

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,370
So that's BE, we know that's
going to be equal to ED.

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,570
And we know that
AE is equal to EC.

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,410
We also know, because
this is a rhombus,

23
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,579
and we proved this
in the last video,

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,870
that the diagonals, not only
do they bisect each other,

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,840
but they are also perpendicular.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,910
So we know that this
is a right angle,

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,660
this is a right angle,
that is a right angle,

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,760
and then this is a right angle.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,860
So the easiest way
to think about it

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,690
is if we can show that
this triangle ADC is

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,230
congruent to triangle ABC,
and if we can figure out

32
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,480
the area of one of them,
we can just double it.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,000
So the first part is
pretty straightforward.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,430
So we can see that
triangle ADC is

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,300
going to be congruent
to triangle ABC,

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,720
and we know that by
side-side-side congruency.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
This side is congruent
to that side.

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,320
This side is congruent to
that side, and they both share

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,940
a C right over here.

40
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,630
So this is by side-side-side.

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,640
And so we can say that the
area-- so because of that,

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,400
we know that the
area of ABCD is just

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,304
going to be equal to
2 times the area of,

44
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,720
we could pick
either one of these.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,270
We could say 2 times
the area of ABC.

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,450

47
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,110
Because area of ABCD-- actually
let me write it this way.

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,100
The area of ABCD is equal to
the area of ADC plus the area

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,687
of ABC.

50
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,270
But since they're
congruent, these two

51
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,103
are going to be the
same thing, so it's just

52
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:35,520
going to be 2 times
the area of ABC.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,190
Now what is the area of ABC?

54
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,200
Well area of a triangle is
just 1/2 base times height.

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:51,010
So area of ABC is just
equal to 1/2 times the base

56
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,200
of that triangle times its
height, which is equal to 1/2.

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,040
What is the length of the base?

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,670
Well the length
of the base is AC.

59
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,670
So it's 1/2-- I'll
color code it.

60
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,470
The base is AC.

61
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,310
And then what is the height?

62
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,910
What is the height here?

63
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,400
Well we know that this
diagonal right over here,

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,470
that it's a
perpendicular bisector.

65
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,750
So the height is just
the distance from BE.

66
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,350
So it's AC times BE,
that is the height.

67
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,320
This is an altitude.

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,500
It intersects this base
at a 90-degree angle.

69
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,590
Or we could say BE is the
same thing as 1/2 times BD.

70
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,220
So this is-- let me write it.

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:41,080
This is equal to, so it's
equal to 1/2 times AC, that's

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,060
our base.

73
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,100
And then our height is
BE, which we're saying

74
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,620
is the same thing
as 1/2 times BD.

75
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,470

76
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,000
So that's the area
of just ABC, that's

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,506
just the area of this broader
triangle right up there,

78
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,130
or that larger triangle
right up there,

79
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,332
that half of the rhombus.

80
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:01,290
But we decided that the
area of the whole thing

81
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,920
is two times that.

82
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,280
So if we go back, if we
use both this information

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,220
and this information right over
here, we have the area of ABCD

84
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,460
is going to be equal to
2 times the area of ABC,

85
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,269
where the area of ABC is
this thing right over here.

86
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,459
So 2 times the area
of ABC, area of ABC

87
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,500
is that right over there.

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,709
So 1/2 times 1/2 is
1/4 times AC times BD.

89
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,250
And then you see
where this is going.

90
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,760
2 times 1/4 fourth is
1/2 times AC times BD.

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,826
Fairly straightforward,
which is a neat result.

92
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,700
And actually, I haven't
done this in a video.

93
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,880
I'll do it in the next video.

94
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,290
There are other ways of finding
the areas of parallelograms,

95
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,789
generally.

96
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,710
It's essentially base times
height, but for a rhombus

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,780
we could do that because
it is a parallelogram,

98
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,050
but we also have this
other neat little result

99
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,716
that we proved in this video.

100
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,590
That if we know the
lengths of the diagonals,

101
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,800
the area of the rhombus
is 1/2 times the products

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,480
of the lengths of the diagonals,
which is kind of a neat result.

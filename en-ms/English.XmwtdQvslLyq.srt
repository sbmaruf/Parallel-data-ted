1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,985
We humans like to get
our heads around all

3
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:06,400
of the complexity around
us by classifying things.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,520
And you could imagine
there's no more obvious thing

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,510
to classify than all of the
living things around us,

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,441
than all of the life
that surrounds us.

7
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,149
So what I want to
start talking about is,

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,060
how do we classify all
of the life around us?

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,620
And this is more often
generally referred to taxonomy.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,149
But the most basic
question you have

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,690
when you look at
all the life around,

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,930
you start to see similarities
between some of these living

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,710
things.

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,560
You see, obviously this
thing right over here

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,670
is more similar to the
things that look like it,

16
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,170
than it does to the grass
behind it, or to that tree.

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,190
And so we start saying, well
maybe I should group this thing

18
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,580
right over here into a group
with other things like it.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,740
And that very most
building block

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,240
of how we classify all of
the living things around us,

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,320
is putting them into
buckets called species.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,190

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,110
So for example, this is
one particular animal,

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,840
but we see other animals
that seem to look like it,

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,910
and so we say they're all
part of the species of lions.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,347
And this animal,
it's one animal,

27
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,180
and there's other animals
that have stripes,

28
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,470
but some might be fatter,
or taller, or skinnier,

29
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,324
or whatever else,
darker, or lighter,

30
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:18,740
but we say they're
similar enough,

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,352
that we call them all tigers.

32
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:24,060
We call all the animals,
even though they

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,665
might be a little bit bigger,
or skinnier, or fatter,

34
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,200
or lighter, or darker, we
call all of them-- they look

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,860
similar to this thing
right over here--

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,727
we would call this a donkey.

37
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,310
We would call the
things that we think

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,920
are like this animal
right here, a horse.

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,340
Now, that might seem like a
pretty straightforward way

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,090
to think about it.

41
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,340
Oh, everything that looks kind
of like this character right

42
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,798
here is a lion,
anything that looks

43
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:52,100
kind of like this character
right here is a tiger.

44
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,810
But that, by itself, is not
a good enough definition

45
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,560
for a species.

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,579
Things that look like
each other or things that

47
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,370
act like each other,
because what we'll see

48
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,330
is that there's some
things that could

49
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,330
be very different, at least
in and how they look or act,

50
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,940
but are actually
closely related.

51
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,639
And we'll talk about what it
means to be closely related.

52
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,180
And then we can see things that
look very similar, that they

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,010
have similar structures or
they have similar behavior,

54
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,130
like for example bats and
birds, but they are actually

55
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,660
all very, very
distantly related.

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,220
So we need a more exact
definition for species

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,410
than just things that
look like each other,

58
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,500
or just things that
act like each other.

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,280
And so the most typical
definition for species

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,300
are animals that can interbreed.

61
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,030

62
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,110
And when we say
interbreed, literally they

63
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,030
can produce offspring
with each other,

64
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,960
and the offspring are fertile.

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,060

66
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,400
Which means that the offspring
can then further have babies,

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,550
that they're not
sterile, that they're

68
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,820
capable of breeding
with other animals

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,570
and producing more offspring.

70
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,690
And to show an example of this,
this right here is a male lion.

71
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,190
You find a male lion
and a female lioness

72
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,720
and most of the time they will
be able to have offspring,

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,180
and those offspring
can go and mate

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,770
with other lions or lionesses,
depending on their sex,

75
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,620
and then they can
have viable offspring.

76
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,080
So it seems to work out
pretty well for lions.

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,350
Same thing is true of tigers.

78
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,590
Now, it does turn
out that if you

79
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:35,720
get a male lion and a female
tigress they can breed.

80
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,719
They can breed and they
can produce offspring.

81
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,510
And their offspring--
which was made famous

82
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,010
by Napoleon Dynamite, he
was kind of fascinated by,

83
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,800
these are kind of
fascinating animals.

84
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,210
Their offspring
is called a liger.

85
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,140
You get a male lion
breeding with a female tiger

86
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,510
you produce a liger,
which is a hybrid,

87
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,847
it's a cross between
a lion and a tiger.

88
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,180
And they're fascinating animals.

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,810
They're actually larger
than either lions or tigers.

90
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,530
They are the largest
cats that we know of.

91
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,830
But these ligers cannot be
referred as a separate species.

92
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,140
Or you can't say
that lions and tigers

93
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,020
are the same species,
because even though they

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,550
are able to interbreed, their
offspring, for the most part,

95
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,410
is not fertile, is not
able to produce offspring.

96
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,360
There have been one off
stories about ligers

97
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,451
being mated with either
a lion or a tiger,

98
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,700
but those are one off stories.

99
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,280
In general, ligers
can't interbreed.

100
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,400
And in general, this
combination isn't

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,140
going to produce offspring
that can keep interbreeding

102
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,210
or that are fertile.

103
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,770
So that's why we say
that lions and tigers are

104
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,309
different species.

105
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,850
And that liger, we wouldn't even
call it as a species at all.

106
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,130
We would actually call it a
hybrid between two species.

107
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,005
Now the same thing is
true-- and actually you

108
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:49,505
might be asking
yourself, well, this

109
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,729
was a male lion and
a female tigress,

110
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,270
what if we went the
other way around?

111
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,332
What if we had a female
lioness and a male tiger?

112
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,540
In that case, you would
produce something else called

113
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,500
a tiglon or a tiglon,
I actually don't

114
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,880
know how to pronounce that.

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
And that is a
different hybrid that

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,370
has slightly different
properties than a liger.

117
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,930
I encourage you to look
up what a tiglon is.

118
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,990
Similarly, you give
me a male donkey.

119
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,760
And donkeys are clearly
a species by themselves,

120
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,680
because if you give me a male
donkey and a female donkey they

121
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,630
can reproduce, produce
another donkey,

122
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,140
and then that donkey can
mate with other donkeys

123
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,550
to produce more
and more donkeys.

124
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,160
So not only can a donkey
interbreed with another donkey,

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,750
but that product,
that child donkey,

126
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,300
can keep interbreeding
with other donkeys.

127
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,910
Similarly, horses, they
can interbreed and produce

128
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,090
fertile offspring.

129
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,890
But if you give me a male
donkey and a female horse

130
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,940
they can mate and they
can produce a mule.

131
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,050

132
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,350
But once again, like
the ligers, mules

133
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,760
are not, at least
as far as I know,

134
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,020
mules they're not fertile.

135
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,860
Mules cannot produce
further offspring.

136
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,000
They cannot interbreed
with each other.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,440
And because, even though
donkeys and horses can

138
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,900
breed and produce mules, their
offspring aren't fertile.

139
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,110
We don't consider
donkeys and horses

140
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,930
part of the same species.

141
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,310
And we would consider mules,
like a liger or a tiglon,

142
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,910
we would consider them a hybrid.

143
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,402
So these are all hybrids,
or we would call cross.

144
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,860
In general, the
word hybrid is used

145
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,160
when you have two things,
two different types that

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,990
are somehow coming together,
somehow having a combination.

147
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,920
And once again, like the
case with the tiglon,

148
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,336
you might say,
well, what if I had

149
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:40,415
a female donkey
and a male horse?

150
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,290
And then you would
actually produce something

151
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,539
called a hinny, which
isn't as common as a mule.

152
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,080
And people like to
use mules, they're

153
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,520
actually very good work
animals because they

154
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,080
have some of the good properties
of both donkeys and horses.

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,790
Hinnies are less common, but
once again, it is possible.

156
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,840
And they have different
properties than mules.

157
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,122
And I do want to
emphasize this idea.

158
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,830
Because when we started
off we just tried

159
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,871
to think about, well, how
can we classify things?

160
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,420
And we said, hey, maybe things
that look and act similar,

161
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,056
we can call a species.

162
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,930
And maybe things that
look and act different,

163
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,340
we shouldn't call them species.

164
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,070
But I want to show you a
very typical case, one that's

165
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,760
really all around us all the
time, where this definition--

166
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,190
animals that can interbreed
and the offspring are fertile--

167
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,410
really does seem to become much,
much more important than just

168
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,840
some notion of animals
that look alike

169
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
or animals that act the same.

170
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,220
And the best example
of that is with dogs.

171
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,820
As I said, this is a very
typical species here,

172
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,800
because dogs-- and I just
took a sample of some

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,710
of the different types
of breeds of dogs--

174
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,080
they can look very,
very different.

175
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,760
It's obvious, look at the
difference between these dogs.

176
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,220
For example, this
little chihuahua

177
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,770
here and this dog
right over here.

178
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,040
Obviously, they're
size-wise, their look,

179
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,750
and even how they act are much,
much more different than maybe

180
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,040
how this donkey would act
relative to this horse,

181
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,820
or how this lion would act
relative to this tigress.

182
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,739
And they obviously
look very different,

183
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:09,280
they have completely
different sizes,

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,899
but these two things
actually can interbreed--

185
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,440
although for these
two in particular,

186
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,780
it seems like the mechanics
would get kind of difficult--

187
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,850
but assuming they get over
the mechanical hurdles

188
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,510
they could interbreed and
produce fertile offspring.

189
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,950
Same for these two characters,
same for these two characters

190
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,735
over here.

191
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:29,110
And because of that, even
though all the different breeds

192
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,790
of dogs-- and most
of this is really

193
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,400
due to humans' doings
of trying to breed

194
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,950
for a specific traits-- even
though they look so different,

195
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,440
and even though they act so
different, because they can

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,190
interbreed, and they could
produce fertile offspring,

197
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,740
we consider all of
these things to be

198
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,730
members of the same species.

199
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,229

1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,840
Look at the two thermometers
below.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,450
Identify which is Celsius and
which is Fahrenheit, and then

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,600
label the boiling and freezing
points of water on each.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,490
Now, the Celsius scale
is what's used in

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,740
the most of the world.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,990
And the easy way to tell that
you're dealing with the

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,810
Celsius scale is on the Celsius
scale, 0 degrees is

8
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,960
freezing of water at standard
temperature and pressure, and

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,300
100 degrees is the boiling point
of water at standard

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,570
temperature and pressure.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,180
Now, on the Fahrenheit scale,
which is used mainly in the

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:01:02,360
United States, the freezing
point of water is 32 degrees,

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:09,300
and boiling of water
is 212 degrees.

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,670
As you could tell, Celsius,
the whole scale came from

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,160
using freezing as 0 of regular
water at standard temperature

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,990
and pressure and setting
100 to be boiling.

17
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,120
On some level, it makes a little
bit more logical sense,

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,790
but at least here in the U.S.,
we still use Fahrenheit.

19
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,450
Now let's figure out which of
these are Fahrenheit and which

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,990
are Celsius.

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,460
Now remember, regardless of
which thermometer you're

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,120
using, water will always
actually boil at the exact

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,850
same temperature.

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,070
So Fahrenheit, 32 degrees, this
has to be the same thing

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,050
as Celsius 0 degrees.

26
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,410
So let's see what happens.

27
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,370
So when this temperature right
here is 0, this one over here,

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,650
it looks like it's negative
something.

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,700
So this one right here doesn't
look like Celsius.

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,610
Here, if we say this is Celsius,
this looks pretty

31
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,530
close to 32 on this one.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,660
Let me do that in
a darker color.

33
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,780
So this one right here looks
like Celsius, and this one

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,300
right here looks like
Fahrenheit.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,550
And the way I was able to tell
is that the 0 degrees Celsius

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,759
needs to be the same thing
as 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

37
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,940
In both cases, this is
where water freezes,

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,355
the freezing point.

39
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,000
That is water freezing.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,900
And let's make sure
we're right.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,330
So if this is the Celsius scale,
this is where water

42
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,370
will boil, 100 degrees Celsius,
and that looks like

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,060
it is right about 212
on the other scale.

44
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,210
So right there is where water
is boiling at standard

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,280
temperature and pressure.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,070
So this thing on the right,
right here, I guess I'll

47
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,890
circle it in orange,
that is Celsius.

48
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,960
And then the one on the left,
I'll do it in magenta, the one

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,370
on the left is Fahrenheit.

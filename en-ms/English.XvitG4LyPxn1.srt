00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,000
In this video I wanna give you the

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,067
basics of Trigonometry.

3
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:09,000
It's sounds like a very complicated topic

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,867
but you're gonna see this is just the study

5
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:15,400
of the ratios of sides of Triangles.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,600
The "Trig" part of "Trigonometry" literally means

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,533
Triangle and the "metry" part literally means

8
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,133
Measure. So let me just give you some examples here.

9
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,600
I think it'll make everything pretty clear.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,400
So let me draw some right triangles, let me just draw

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,867
one right triangle. So this is a right triangle.

12
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,344
When I say it's a right triangle, it's because

13
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,200
one of the angles here is 90 degrees.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,805
This right here is a right angle.

15
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:48,067
It is equal to 90 degrees.

16
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,200
And we will talk about other ways

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,400
to show the magnitude of angles in future videos.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,533
So we have a 90 degree angle.

19
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,541
It's a right triangle, let me put some

20
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:03,267
lengths to the sides here. So this side over here is maybe 3. This height right over there is 3.

21
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:07,200
Maybe the base of the triangle right over here is 4.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,800
and then the hypotenuse of the triangle over here is 5.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,000
You only have a hypotenuse when you have a right triangle.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,400
It is the side opposite the right angle and it is the longest side of a right triangle.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
So that right there is the hypotenuse.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,733
You've probably learned that already from geometry.

27
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,933
And you can verify that this right triangle - the sides work out -

28
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,333
we know from the Pythagorean theorem, that 3 squared

29
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:43,067
plus 4 squared, has got to be equal to the length of the longest side,

30
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,733
the length of the hypotenuse squared is equal to 5 squared

31
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,111
so you can verify that this works out

32
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,800
that this satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,267
Now with that out of the way let's learn a little bit of Trigonometry.

34
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:58,800
The core functions of trigonometry,

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,789
we're going to learn a little more about what these functions mean.

36
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,533
There is the sine, the sine function.

37
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:11,200
There is the cosine function, and there is the tangent function.

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,733
And you write sin, or S-I-N, C-O-S, and "tan" for short.

39
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:20,333
And these really just specify, for any angle in this triangle,

40
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,133
it will specify the ratios of certain sides.

41
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,451
So let me just write something out.

42
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:26,533
This is really something of a mnemonic here,

43
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:30,267
so something just to help you remember the definitions of these functions,

44
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:34,733
but I'm going to write down something called "soh cah

45
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:43,400
toa", you'll be amazed how far this mnemonic will take you in trigonometry.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,800
We have "soh cah toa", and what this tells us is;

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:58,667
"soh" tells us that "sine" is equal to opposite over hypotenuse.

48
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,667
It's telling us. And this won't make a lot of sense just now,

49
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,800
I'll do it in a little more detail in a second.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:13,133
And then cosine is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse.

51
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:18,533
And then you finally have tangent,

52
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:22,733
tangent is equal to opposite over adjacent.

53
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,533
So you're probably saying, "hey, Sal, what is all this "opposite"

54
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,733
"hypotenuse", "adjacent", what are we talking about?"

55
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,267
Well, let's take an angle here.

56
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:34,933
Let's say that this angle right over here is theta,

57
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,933
between the side of the length 4, and the side

58
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,667
of length 5. This is theta.

59
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,200
So lets figure out the sine of theta,

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,467
the cosine of theta, and what the tangent of

61
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,267
theta are.

62
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:51,533
So if we first want to focus on the sine of theta,

63
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,067
we just have to remember "soh cah toa",

64
00:03:55,067 --> 00:04:00,533
sine is opposit over hypotonuse, so sine of theta is equal to the opposite -

65
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,133
so what is the opposite side to the angle?

66
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,600
So this is our angle right here, the opposite side,

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,133
if we just go to the opposite side,

68
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:13,539
not one of the sides that are kind of adjacent to the angle,

69
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,200
the opposite side is the 3,

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,067
if you're just kinda - it's opening on to that 3,

71
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,400
so the opposite side is 3.

72
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,267
And then what is the hypotenuse?

73
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,467
Well, we already know - the hypotenuse here is 5.

74
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:27,600
So it's 3 over 5.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,467
The sine of theta is 3/5.

76
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:35,667
And I'm going to show you in a second, that the sine of theta -

77
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,867
if this angle is a certain angle - it's always going to be 3/5.

78
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:42,657
The ratio of the opposite to the hypotenuse is always going to be the same,

79
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,396
even if the actual triangle were a larger triangle

80
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,333
or a smaller one.

81
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,333
So I'll show you that in a second.

82
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,200
So let's go throught all of the trig functions.

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,867
Let's think about what the cosine of theta is.

84
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:57,933
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, so remember -

85
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,200
let me label them.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,533
We already figured out that the 3 was the opposite side.

87
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,733
This is the opposite side.

88
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,333
And only when we're talking about this angle.

89
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,800
When we're talking about this angle - this side is opposite to it.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,400
When we're talking about this angle, this 4 side

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,733
is adjacent to it,

92
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,867
it's one of the sides that kind of make up - that

93
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,267
kind of form the vertex here.

94
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:23,333
So this right here is the adjacent side.

95
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,733
And I want to be very clear,

96
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,600
this only applies to this angle.

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,867
If we're talking about that angle,

98
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,800
then this green side would be opposite,

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,733
and this yellow side would be adjacent.

100
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,437
But we're just focusing on this angle right over here.

101
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:40,467
So cosine of this angle - so the adjacent side of this angle is 4,

102
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:43,533
so the adjacent over the hypotenuse,

103
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:47,400
the adjacent, which is 4, over the hypotenuse,

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,480
4 over 5.

105
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,200
Now let's do the tangent.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Let's do the tangent.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,867
The tangent of theta: opposite over adjacent.

108
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:06,333
The opposite side is 3. What is the adjacent side?

109
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,667
We've already figured that out, the adjacent

110
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,933
side is 4.

111
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,800
So knwoing the sides of this right triangle,

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,933
we were able to figure out the major trig ratios.

113
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,867
And we'll see that there are other trig ratios,

114
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,267
but they can all be derived from these three

115
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:23,000
basic trig functions.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,267
Now, let's think about another angle in this triangle,

117
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,400
and I'll re-draw it, because my triangle is getting a little bit messy.

118
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,133
So I'll re-draw the exact same triangle.

119
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,133
The exact same triangle.

120
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:37,867
And, once again, the lengths of this triangle are -

121
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:42,067
we have length 4 there, we have length 3 there,

122
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,000
we have length 5 there.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In the last example we used this theta.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,548
But let's do another angle, let's do another angle up here,

125
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:56,933
and let's call this angle  - I don't know,  I'll think of something,

126
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,533
a random Greek letter.

127
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,267
So let's say it's psi.

128
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,512
It's, I know, a little bit bizarre.

129
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:02,533
Theta is what you normally use,

130
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:05,067
but since I've already used theta, let's use psi.

131
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,933
Or actually - let me simplify it,

132
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:09,000
let me call this angle x.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,707
Let's call that angle x.

134
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:13,333
So let's figure out the trig functions for that angle x.

135
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:18,267
So we have sine of x, is going to be equal to what?

136
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:21,000
Well sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
So what side is opposite to x?

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Well it opens on to this 4,

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,467
it opens on to the 4.

140
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,933
So in this context, this is now the opposite,

141
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,133
this is now the opposite side.

142
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:32,633
Remember: 4 was adjacent to this theta,

143
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:41,729
but it's opposite to x.

144
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,229
So it's going to be 4 over -

145
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,333
now what's the hypotenuse?

146
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:43,933
Well, the hypotenuse is going to be the same

147
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:44,933
regardless of which angle you pick,

148
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,467
so the hypotenuse is now going to be 5,

149
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:46,967
so it's 4/5.

150
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:55,067
Now let's do another one; what is the cosine of x?

151
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,733
So cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

152
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,667
What side is adjacent to x, that's not the hypotenuse?

153
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,200
You have the hypotenuse here.

154
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,533
Well the 3 side, it's one of the sides that

155
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,267
forms the vertex that x is at, that's not the hypotenuse,

156
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,333
so this is the adjacent side.

157
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,333
That is the adjacent.

158
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,376
So it's 3 over the hypotenuse,

159
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,800
the hypotenuse is 5.

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,133
And then finally, the tangent.

161
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,271
We want to figure out the tangent of x.

162
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,733
Tangent is opposite over adjacent,

163
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,983
"soh cah toa", tangent is opposite over adjacent,

164
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,533
opposite over adjacent.

165
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,933
The opposite side is 4.

166
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,267
I want to do it in that blue color.

167
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:42,902
The opposite side is 4, and the adjacent side is 3.

168
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:43,402
And we're done!

169
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:46,159
And in the next video I'll do a ton of more examples of this,

170
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,511
just so that we really get a feel for it.

171
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,867
But I'll leave you thinking of what happens when

172
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,369
these angle start to approach 90 degrees,

173
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:55,044
or how could they even get larger than 90 degrees.

174
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:56,933
And we'll see that this definition,

175
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,067
the "soh cah toa" definition takes us a long way

176
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,933
for angles that are between 0 and 90 degrees,

177
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,333
or that are less than 90 degrees.

178
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,067
But they kind of start to mess up

179
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,067
really at the boundries.

180
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,667
And we're going to introduce a new definition,

181
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,933
that's kind of derived from the "soh cah toa" definition

182
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,533
for finding the sine, cosine and tangent

183
00:09:11,533 --> 99:59:59,000
of really any angle.

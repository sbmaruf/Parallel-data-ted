1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
where I get this thing to work.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
about doing anything about aging.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
namely, by actually doing something about it.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to do that in two steps.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first one I'm going to talk about is

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
who are already in middle-age when you start --

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or indeed, to get sick in the first place.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is how to reach that intermediate step,

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that point of maybe 30 years life extension.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So I'm going to start with why we should.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, I want to ask a question.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That was easy. OK.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And here is that characteristic.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to talk about the comparison with foxhunting,

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which is something that was banned after a long struggle,

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
by the government not very many months ago.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a traditional part of the way of life,

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
because the majority of the British public,

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and certainly the majority of members of Parliament,

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
came to the conclusion that it was really something

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I think that human aging shares

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
all of these characteristics in spades.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What part of this do people not understand?

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's not just about life, of course --

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
(Laughter) --

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it's about healthy life, you know --

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
whether or not dying may be fun.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a global trance.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that people give for aging.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that these excuses are completely valueless.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There are some good points to be made here,

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But these are completely crazy, when you actually

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
remember your sense of proportion.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You know, these are arguments; these are things that

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
would be legitimate to be concerned about.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But the question is, are they so dangerous --

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
these risks of doing something about aging --

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
namely, leaving aging as it is?

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are these so bad that they outweigh

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
then just don't waste my time, is what I say.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
(Laughter)

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now, there is one argument

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
People worry about overpopulation; they say,

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or at least the death toll is going to be much lower,

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and kids are really important to most people."

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And that's true.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and give answers like this.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
or a high death rate.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And, I say that that's fine --

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If we vacillate, hesitate,

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and do not actually develop these therapies,

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
who would have been young enough and healthy enough

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to benefit from those therapies, but will not be,

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and I consider that that is immoral.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Right. So the next thing is,

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
now why should we get a little bit more active on this?

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And the fundamental answer is that

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
why aging is actually a good thing after all.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and we might be in range of doing something about aging --

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
this becomes part of the problem.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
in order to get people's attention, and make people realize

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that they are in a trance in this regard.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A very simple definition.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
which is to say, metabolism.

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is not a completely tautological statement;

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it's a reasonable statement.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and it also happens to us,

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
has side effects.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And there are really two games in town,

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day,

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
when pathology is becoming evident,

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and stop the accumulation of side effects

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
from causing the pathology quite so soon.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
because the things that are causing the pathology

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
are becoming more abundant as time goes on.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
because, you know, prevention is better than cure.

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
even cells we're not really too good on yet.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We've discovered things like, for example,

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
RNA interference only a few years ago,

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
but it is not an approach whose time has come

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
when we're talking about intervention.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So then, what do we do about that?

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
pretty ironclad, doesn't it?

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But it isn't.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
into what I'm calling step two.

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
let's say we do it today for the sake of argument --

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What would that actually mean

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
for how long people of various ages today --

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
would actually live?

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
but it's not simple.

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
then they'll live 30 years longer."

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's the wrong answer.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There are two sorts of technological progress really,

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for this purpose.

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs,

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now, they differ a great deal

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
in terms of the predictability of time frames.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Fundamental breakthroughs:

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
very hard to predict how long it's going to take

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to make a fundamental breakthrough.

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in the progression of the technology of powered flight.

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We can think, really, that each one is sort of

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The incremental advances have added up to something

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
which is not incremental anymore.

215
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
happening of course a bit later.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you know, the same sort of time frame.

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
isn't a step at all.

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That in fact, the people who are young enough

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to benefit from these first therapies

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that give this moderate amount of life extension,

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
will be at some sort of cusp.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The therapies will be improving faster than

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This is a very important point for me to get across.

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because, you know, most people, when they hear

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that are so thoroughly eliminating aging

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not saying that at all.

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
will be enough.

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.

244
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.

245
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I decided to give this a little name,

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
which is "longevity escape velocity."

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
(Laughter)

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, it seems to get the point across.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,

250
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in terms of remaining life expectancy,

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
as measured by their health,

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and an average 80-year-old,

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
because you're too close to death's door

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You won't be able to withstand them.

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
(Laughter) --

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
eventually get through this

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that,

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
then you're never really even going

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
we don't know how old that person is today,

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
because we don't know how long it's going to take

272
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
to get these first-generation therapies.

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But irrespective of that age,

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And that's quite a thought.

278
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that will allow us to get to escape velocity?

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And this is what it is.

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
which basically means mice that live about three years on average.

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and with those therapies, we get them to live,

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
on average, to their fifth birthday.

292
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So, in other words, we add two years --

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
we treble their remaining lifespan,

294
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
starting from the point that we started the therapies.

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Which we can now, as I've explained,

298
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
starting from the time we get the mice?

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to actually how much people want it?

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And it seems to me that the first question

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
is entirely a biology question,

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and it's extremely hard to answer.

307
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
One has to be very speculative,

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I say that's nonsense.

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame,

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
in order to give people a sense of proportion

314
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
so that they can assess their priorities.

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance

316
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
of reaching this RHR milestone,

317
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
15 years from the robust mouse.

320
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So they'll probably think it's five years away.

323
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say

325
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That will be history at this point,

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and of course that has enormous implications.

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to use this word "damage"

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and that eventually cause pathology.

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because the critical thing about this

338
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,

339
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But it is not part of metabolism itself.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And this turns out to be useful.

342
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
at which metabolism lays down this damage.

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
in concrete biological terms in a moment.

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
by stopping the damage converting into pathology.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And the reason it's a losing battle

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We can call it the "engineering approach,"

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.

355
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It does not intervene in this process or this one.

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and it's something that we are within range of being able to do,

359
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.

360
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The engineering approach simply says,

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold

364
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We know that this threshold exists,

366
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is important for aging in one way or another.

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.

374
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The list on the right is also incomplete.

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and it's just an incomplete list.

377
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --

378
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,

379
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
or that might cause pathology.

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And there are only seven of them.

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.

384
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.

385
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Of course one can make a biological argument.

386
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"

387
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.

388
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What can damage accumulate in?

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The answer is: long-lived molecules,

390
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's got to be long-lived molecules.

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and that is pretty good news, because it means that,

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
so the fact that we haven't extended this list

397
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.

401
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but

403
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,

404
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,

405
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
but we do need to get serious about it.

406
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We do need to really start trying.

407
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience,

408
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.

409
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk,

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.

411
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I've published a great deal on this;

412
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and there's quite a lot of detail there.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The detail is what makes me confident

415
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.

416
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So if you think that I'm wrong,

417
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.

418
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
who call themselves gerontologists because,

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,

421
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant

422
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and not really to take it seriously.

423
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,

424
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in order to understand whether this is true.

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And we'll just end with a few things.

426
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session

427
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,

428
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."

429
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And you know what happened.

430
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So, you know, this does happen.

431
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
which is basically an incentive to innovate,

433
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and to do what you think is going to work,

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and you get money for it if you win.

435
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is what's going to take a bit of money.

437
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?

438
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Not very long. OK.

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
(Laughter)

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,

441
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but it's basically got a 90 percent  chance, I think, of succeeding in this.

442
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Thank you.

444
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
(Applause)

445
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions

446
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
but I thought I would give people the chance.

447
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
(Laughter)

450
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.

451
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
(Laughter)

452
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
(Applause)

453
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.

455
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,

456
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.

457
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,

458
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?

459
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question

460
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
which I happen to agree with,

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.

465
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;

466
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes

467
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in order to age more slowly,

468
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.

469
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,

470
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,

471
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
living a long time or by procreation,

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
there's a certain amount of modulation of that,

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
which is why different species have different lifespans,

474
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
but that's why there are no immortal species.

475
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
CA: The genes don't care but we do?

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
AG: That's right.

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,

478
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.

479
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If I project that, that would make me think

480
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?

482
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.

483
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
(Laughter)

484
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Your numbers are a bit out.

485
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The standard numbers are that lifespans

486
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
have been growing at between one and two years per decade.

487
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.

488
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.

489
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults

490
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
are actually in the human embryo,

491
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.

492
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If that is indeed true,

493
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?

494
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,

495
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
AG: There are technical implications certainly.

497
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Basically what we need to do is replace cells

498
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,

499
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them

500
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,

501
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.

502
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on

503
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
was a little bit of an oversimplification.

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --

505
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
but they do it by not having a nervous system --

506
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function

507
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
on very long-lived cells.

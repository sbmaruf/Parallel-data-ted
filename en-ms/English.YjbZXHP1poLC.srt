1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The answer is that soup occurs in most of these phrases

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but not 100% of them.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's missing in this phrase.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Equivalently, on the Chinese side

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we see this character occurs

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in most of the phrases,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but it's missing here.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we see that the correspondence doesn't have to be 100%

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to tell us that there is still a good chance of a correlation.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When we're learning to do machine translation

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we use these kinds of alignments to learn probability tables

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of what is the probability of one phrase in one language

13
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,000
corresponding to the phrase in another language.

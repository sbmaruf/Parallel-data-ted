00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,971
On the 4th of July, 2011 we posted a request online

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:09,500
to participate in a short film about interdependence.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,351
Artwork and videos emerged from around the world.

4
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:17,084
Here is what unfolded...

5
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:28,073
When in the course of human events...

6
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:31,000
It becomes increasingly necessary

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
to recognize the fundamental qualities

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,707
that connect us.

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,177
Then we must reevaluate

10
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:49,917
the truths we hold to be self evident.

11
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,454
That all humans are created equal

12
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:53,940
and all are connected

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,979
That all humans are created equal and all are connected.

14
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,997
That we share the pursuits of life

15
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:03,730
liberty

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,154
happiness

17
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:06,850
food

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,068
water

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,799
shelter

20
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,850
safety

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,850
education

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,977
justice

23
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:17,450
and hopes for a better future.

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,900
That our collective knowledge

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,000
economy

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,268
technology and environment

27
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:24,000
are fundamentally interdependent.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,289
Interdependent.

29
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:33,832
That what will propel us forward as a species

30
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:37,477
is our curiosity

31
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:41,262
our ability to forgive

32
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:45,205
our ability to appreciate

33
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,532
our courage

34
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:54,181
and our desire to connect.

35
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,775
That these things we share

36
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,004
will ultimately help us evolve

37
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:03,857
to our fullest common potential.

38
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,250
And whereas we should take our problems seriously

39
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,199
we should never take ourselves too seriously

40
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,369
Because another thing that connects us

41
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,437
is our ability to laugh

42
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:24,511
and our attempt to learn from our mistakes.

43
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,514
So that we can learn from the past

44
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,752
understand our place in the world

45
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:36,400
and use our collective knowledge

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,263
to create a better future

47
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,800
So perhaps it’s time

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,738
that we as a species

49
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:56,611
who love to laugh

50
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:01,949
ask questions and connect

51
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,085
do something radical and true.

52
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:10,845
For centuries we have declared independence

53
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:12,159
Perhaps it’s now time

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,887
that we as humans

55
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:16,250
declare our interdependence

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:47,556
Interdependence

57
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:52,014
To declare your Interdependence...

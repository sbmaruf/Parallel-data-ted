1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:06,980
We're asked to multiply 32.12,
or 32 and 12 hundredths, times

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,620
0.5, or just 5 tenths.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,630
Now when you multiply decimals,
you multiply them

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,700
the exact same way you would
multiply whole numbers, and

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,380
then you count the number of
spaces behind the decimal you

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,330
have in your two numbers you're
multiplying, and you're

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,720
going to have that many spaces
in your product.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,340
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,320
So let's just multiply
these two characters.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:35,720
So we have 32.12 times 0.5.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,670
And when you write them out, you
can just push both of them

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,710
all the way to the right.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,530
You could almost ignore
the decimal.

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,285
Right now, you should write the
decimal where they belong,

15
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:48,660
but you can almost pretend that
this is 3,212 times 5,

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,580
and then we'll worry about
the decimals in a second.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,920
So let's get started.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,390
So if we were just multiplying
5 times 3,212, we would say,

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,540
well, 5 times 2 is 10.

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,030
Regroup the 1.

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:08,860
5 times 1 is 5, plus 1 is 6.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,260
5 times 2 is 10.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,720
Regroup the 1.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,400
And then finally, you have 5
times 3 is 15, plus 1 is 16.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,800
And then we don't have
any other places.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,800
If we were just doing this as
05, we wouldn't multiply 0

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,480
times this whole thing.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,240
We would just get 0 anyway.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,000
So just 5 times 3,212 gives
us this number.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
But now we want to care
about the decimals.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,740
We just have to count the total
number of spaces or

32
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,710
places we have behind the
decimal point in the two

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,750
numbers we're multiplying.

34
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,380
So we have one, two, three
spaces, or three numbers, to

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,090
the right of the decimals in
the two numbers that we're

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,970
multiplying.

37
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,990
So we need that many numbers to
the right of the decimal in

38
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,530
our answer.

39
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,910
So we go one, two, three, put
the decimal right over there.

40
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,080
So 32.12 times 0.5 is 16.060.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,220
And this trailing zero right
here we can ignore, because

42
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,390
it's really not adding any
information there.

43
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,200
So we could just write
this as 16.06.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,780
The last thing you want to do
is just make sure that this

45
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,670
makes sense.

46
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,530
You have a number that's
almost 32, and we're

47
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,990
multiplying it by 0.5.

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,860
Remember, 0.5 is the same thing
as 5 over 10, which is

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,090
the same thing as 1/2.

50
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,670
So we're really multiplying
32.12 times 1/2.

51
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,100
We're trying to figure out what
one half of 32.12 is.

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,640
And half of 32 is 16, and half
of 0.12 0.06, so this makes

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,450
complete sense.

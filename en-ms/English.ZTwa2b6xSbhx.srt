Episode 3

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:21,675
Carry her!!

4
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:26,009
Stop!

5
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:31,067
Carry her!

6
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,149
Don't misunderstand.

7
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,033
I don't have anything to do with this.

8
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:38,114
Oh Ha Ni, I knew you'd do this.

9
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:39,926
No matter the situation, you're always a pain.

10
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,744
What?!

11
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:44,377
- A pain? - Yes, a pain!

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,738
Geez!

13
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:46,831
Then,

14
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,333
is it okay if I tell them we live together?

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,467
Are you crazy?

16
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,679
So what do you want me to do?

17
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,105
What's going on?

18
00:00:55,105 --> 00:01:00,009
You act all foolish, but you end up getting what you want.

19
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,001
I despise characters like you.

20
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,967
What!

21
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,689
This is getting...

22
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,433
What?

23
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,919
Get on!

24
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,033
Forget it!

25
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:13,477
What do you mean forget about it?If it's what you want, just get on!

26
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:17,867
I said forget it! Let go of me.

27
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:23,167
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

28
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:31,003
Baek Seung Jo, aren't you going to let go of that hand?

29
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:35,064
I told you to let go!

30
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:35,891
You again?

31
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:40,909
Yeah! Why?

32
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,138
Ha Ni, I heard about it and I'm very proud of you!

33
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:49,833
And, I'm very sorry I didn't believe you when you said you were studying.

34
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:56,033
Instead, I'll carry you and go around the school as many times as you want! Get on!

35
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,713
Why are you being like this too?

36
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:00,008
Get on. Here!

37
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,525
Hey, come here.

38
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:06,533
You jerk!

39
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,332
Quick, quick!

40
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:23,000
- Bong Joon Gu! - Hey!

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,001
Let's go! Are you kidding me?

42
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,267
Hey, let me go!

43
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,133
Ha Ni, where should we go?

44
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:35,011
- What do you mean where? Let me down! - Let's go to the ends of this Earth!

45
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,633
Hey!

46
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:41,933
- Hey, Bong Joon Gu! - I really can't live because of him!

47
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,411
- Hey! Hurry, let me... - Let's...

48
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,335
Hurry and put me down!

49
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:49,947
Hurry! Aren't you gonna let me down?!

50
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:57,233
Argh! Really!

51
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,333
Hey, Bong Joon Gu! Why don't you have any sense?

52
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:00,943
What about me?

53
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:06,467
How could you give her a piggyback ride right then?!

54
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,478
Really?

55
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:09,502
Was I wrong to do that?

56
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:11,933
Yeah, of course you were!

57
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:15,021
Why do you think Ha Ni studied like there's no tomorrow?

58
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:17,497
You interrupting little...

59
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,033
Really?

60
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:24,834
Ha Ni, do you still like Baek Seung Jo?

61
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:29,002
Even though he embarrassed you, you still like him?

62
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:33,034
Maybe you like that annoyingly girly boy kind of style.

63
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:36,167
No, I don't like him.

64
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,633
Why should I like him? What's there to like about a guy like that?

65
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,001
Exactly!

66
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:45,067
He has a totally sharp tongue. He's just out to get people.

67
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,902
He's selfish and sneaky.

68
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:50,733
And he doesn't have a grain of humanity in him.

69
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:54,167
Anyway, he's over the top.

70
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,002
So, you hate him now?

71
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,028
I hate him!

72
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:03,178
Well that's that, but Ha Ni, you can use the Special Study Hall now?

73
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,007
Yes.

74
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:06,437
That's right.

75
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,127
- You're amazing! - How did you do that?

76
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:13,078
Truly amazing.

77
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,693
See that girl, Oh Ha Ni.

78
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,976
The one that got into the Special Study Hall?

79
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:23,745
That's amazing. I'm so jealous!

80
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:26,211
She's the girl who was humiliated by Baek Seung Jo.

81
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:27,009
- Her house collapsed. <Br>- That's right, her!

82
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,277
- She always forgets. - What's with her?

83
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:40,967
- Hey, it's her. She looks pretty cute. - Amazing.

84
00:04:40,967 --> 00:05:34,006
[Special Study Hall]

85
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:52,933
Hi!

86
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:59,005
What, are you studying or dating?

87
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:08,006
Sorry.

88
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,567
Those punks!

89
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:15,233
I'm giving you this because I'm so grateful. If I don't, then I'd look ungrateful.

90
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:25,003
I don't want it.

91
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:30,367
OH HA NI!

92
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,008
I apologize.

93
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:51,091
Sorry, sorry.

94
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:55,082
[Quiet Please]

95
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,002
Look for her!

96
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,681
Just be quiet!

97
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,002
- I can't see! - She's right there! Over there!

98
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:04,000
Who are you?!

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,002
These punks.What are you doing here?!

100
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,776
Um... You see...

101
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:14,004
Vice Principal, I need to check on something. It'll be quick.

102
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:17,033
Oh these punks, really!

103
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,005
There she is!

104
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,904
Ha Ni!

105
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:30,967
Oh Ha Ni! What are you doing?!

106
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:34,708
Teacher Song Kang Yi.

107
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,867
Teacher!

108
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:39,534
Yes!

109
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:43,595
Don't you think that student Oh Ha Ni is a little strange?

110
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,086
Yes, she is a little strange.

111
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:47,774
No, that's not what I meant.

112
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:53,078
How could she suddenly go from the bottom class to the top fifty students?

113
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:55,523
What's weird about that?

114
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:57,567
You can achieve anything when you work hard for it.

115
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,174
But it does sound suspicious!

116
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:01,333
Ha!

117
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,567
Why? What's so weird about that?

118
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,333
Could she possibly have cheated?

119
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,029
Sorry?

120
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,142
Cheating?

121
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:17,533
Whose answers could she copy from in my class?

122
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:20,533
Good. Let's wait and see.

123
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,467
Then, that's it, but...

124
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:32,033
...this Friday, the sophomores are going on a picnic and the juniors an MT. Seniors are the problem.

125
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:35,033
What should we do? For at least one day...

126
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,283
Let's have a physical tournament!

127
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,534
Seniors doing what?They only have a few days until their SATs.

128
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:42,924
They have to build physical strength in order to study well. Seniors don't even take P.E.

129
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:46,733
Instead of a day of physical activity, how about a picnic?

130
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:49,712
Okay, then Teacher Song Ji Ho's class and my class will be the only participants.

131
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:52,366
What? But why our class...?

132
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,087
Are you saying that Class 1 is better than Class 7 at everything?

133
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:58,124
We'll just have to wait and see if that's true or not.

134
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:00,767
If my class wins, I'll call you "Oppa."

135
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,329
B-but... Wh-what?

136
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,003
That's a good idea.

137
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:07,063
Then, what should we make the event about?

138
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,295
Vice Principal!

139
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,533
Just think of it as a day off, kids.That doesn't make sense!

140
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,033
What do you mean? Seniors in a physical tournament!?

141
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:18,003
"Let's just blow it!" You can't think that way!

142
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:20,933
We have to beat Class 1 and show them what we've got!

143
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:24,567
Stake your life! Got it?

144
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:28,767
Why don't I hear a response?

145
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,867
Bong Joon Gu!

146
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:35,023
Then, Teacher, what are you going to stake?

147
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,008
What?

148
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:42,133
If we're staking our lives, what are you going to stake?

149
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,119
Alright.

150
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:48,033
If we win all three events...

151
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:57,799
...I will treat you all to pizza.

152
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,652
For this tournament, let's take the opportunity to make Class 1 all bleed from their noses!

153
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:16,823
Got it?!

Gather round! Gather over here!

160
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,657
Listen carefully, okay?

161
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:59,039
The baton pass is very important for this race.

162
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,957
When you get the baton, your left hand should be stretched out,

163
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:05,857
and you run, run, run, run all the while.

164
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:05,957
You are standing by.

165

...your start will be late and that won't do!

167
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:13,389
Do you get it?

168
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,923
Then, should we try it again?

169
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,157
Ha Ni!

170
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,089
Come over here, dear.

171
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,523
Let's...see...

172
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,089
When you're passing the baton, with your right...

173
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,323
...hand here. No, no, no, right here.

174
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:32,039
Okay, okay, you're running, running.

175
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,657
Now. That's right!

176
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:36,857
Our Ha Ni is doing so well!

177
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,823
Let's try again.

178
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,059
There's no better comedy than this!

179
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,057
What? Baek Seung Jo!

180
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:46,089
Did you come here to steal our strategy?

181
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,009
You even have a strategy?

182
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,157
Baek Seung Jo! Don't cry when we win!

183
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:53,019
I'm not going to go easy.

184
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,257
Do whatever you want.

185
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:58,557
Our class isn't interested in a physical tournament.

186
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,923
Your class will definitely win.

187
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,019
Wh...what'd you say?

188
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,057
So, your class is going to go easy and that's why we'll win, is that what you're saying?

189
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,223
This punk! You're going too far!

190
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,557
- Really! - Stop!

191
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:09,357
Ah, Joon Gu!

192
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:13,049
How pitiful.

193
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,722
What's pitiful?

194
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:16,196
What?

195
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:19,486
Why is doing your best pitiful?

196
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:24,257
You're not going to do your best so we're gonna win?

197
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,089
Joon Gu is super fast!

198
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,823
And he's good at sports!

199
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,049
Did you have any idea?

200
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,039
Ha Ni!

201
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,523
Just because you think you'll lose... How cowardly!

202
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:40,557
Well, I heard that in a fight, the losing cock crows loudest.

203
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:41,957
What?

204
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:42,823
Cock?

205
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:50,029
Yeah!! Cock!!

206
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,623
Oh my! How fun that's going to be!

207
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:56,023
You two are both in the race?

208
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,457
That's cool!

209
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,623
But who do I cheer for?

210
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,242
It's worrying me...

211
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,099
You're not really thinking of going...?

212
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,039
Of course I will. I'll be taking pictures.

213
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,049
It's not like an elementary tournament!

214
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:12,957
But still...

215
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,323
What's so fun about P.E.?

216
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,657
Wow!

217
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,049
Ah!

218
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,059
Eun Jo, you have to retake the jump roping test?

219
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:23,157
When is it?

220
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:26,723
I don't know. When would I ever use jump roping?

221
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,423
You want me to teach you?

222
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:29,323
I'm good at jump roping.

223
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:33,723
That's all right. What can a fool teach?

224
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,257
At first, I wasn't good either,

225
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:39,099
but after giving it my best, it worked out well.

226
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,357
Well? What can work out well?

227
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:45,457
They say if you keep sharpening steel, it will eventually become a needle.

228
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:50,039
Oh my! Where did you learn sayings like that?

229
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,323
From my Grandma.

230
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:54,323
Aiyoo, how adorable.

231
00:13:54,323 --> 00:14:08,079
Here.

232
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,019
Wooow!

233
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,123
You should wear one too!

234
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,557
I don't want to! I'm not going to cosplay!

235
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,723
Just leave it then!

236
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:22,009
Min Ah, can you zip this up for me?

237
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,157
Hey! You're wearing this even though it's so hot?

238
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,756
Yep, Jang Mi gave this to me.

239
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,856
She said this is the only one that fits me.

240
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:32,023
Really?

241
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:35,323
That fox-like girl treating you...

242
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,757
Hey, Ha Ni, take a look at me.

243
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:39,487
How do I look?

244
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:42,257
Ohhhhh! Lady Gaga!

245
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,857
Correct!

246
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,023
Oh look at me!

247
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,823
With a square waist...

248
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:51,057
A pig's shape line?

249
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,079
A pig's shape line? You wanna get hit?

250
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,423
- Hey, come over here! - Ahhh!

251
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:55,523
Hey, stand right there!

252
00:14:55,523 --> 00:15:02,223
Hey, hey, hey! Go Min Ah!

253
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,069
Seung Jo!

254
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,049
We have to wear this.

255
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,057
<i> Ah, it's Baek Seung Jo.

256
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:16,023
Hurry and come to the field!

257
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,557
<i>Ah, he doesn't know it's me!

258
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:20,079
<i>Pitiful?

259
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:52,009
<i>You're dead!

260
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:58,757
Who are you?

261
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:38,423
You!

262
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:44,089
Class 7 Fighting!

263
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:48,223
Urgh, so tired.

264
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:49,023
Ah, it's hot!

265
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:50,557
Are you hot?

266
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,823
I can't wear it any longer!

267
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:53,157
- Why? You have to! - Awwww...

268
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:54,223
Ahhhh I don't want to!

269
00:16:54,223 --> 00:17:00,023
You have to wear it!

270
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:01,623
Players...

271
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:03,823
...face each other.

272
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:09,157
Greet each other.

273
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,257
Ready!

274
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:17,557
Let's do well!

275
00:17:17,557 --> 00:18:07,623
We are one!

276
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:13,844
Teacher! Teacher!

277
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,357
Give it your all, kids!

278
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:41,489
Let's go!

279
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:50,323
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:52,322
Class 1 Fighting!

281
00:18:52,322 --> 00:19:12,079
Class 1 Fighting!

282
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:21,623
Pull!

283
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:24,059
Class 7 wins!

284
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,059
Omo!

285
00:19:26,059 --> 00:20:01,638
What in the world!

286
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:11,088
Please bring the list of the students who will be running in the relay race.

287
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:14,377
Oh! It's my Seung Jo!

288
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:21,343
It's hot.

289
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:24,184
Oppa! Baek Seung Jo Fighting! Baek Seung Jo! Baek Seung Jo!

290
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:27,843
Hey! Hey! You!

291
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,509
Shh! Shh! Shh!

292
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:32,043
Oh my!

293
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:33,877
Sit down. Sit down.

294
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,243
Quiet.

295
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:38,929
You came, Mother?

296
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:42,031
I'm Jang Mi. Hong Jang Mi.

297
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,543
Hong Jang Mi?

298
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:49,051
My mother and I have been to your house before. We have the eyeglass store at the intersection.

299
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:52,915
Ah, Jang Mi! The eyeglass store at the intersection!

300
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,592
Long time no see.

301
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,907
But, are you cheering for Seung Jo?

302
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,071
Pardon?

303
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,643
Yes.

304
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:04,276
You came at the right time.

305
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,091
I was deciding who to cheer for.

306
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:12,001
You cheer for Seung Jo, okay?

307
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:17,977
Pardon?

308
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,743
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

309
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,041
Baek Seung Jo.

310
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:28,225
What do you think? It's 2 : 0!

311
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:38,117
It looks like you guys tried really freaking hard. Didn't you say you're doing it half-heartedly?

312
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:44,843
Hey, punk! If a person is talking, you should reply.Are you deaf? Can't you hear me! Can't you hear me!

313
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,677
Are you the last runner?

314
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:48,143
What?

315
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:52,877
Yeah! Why?

316
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:54,677
Are you the last runner too?

317
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,477
Yes.

318
00:21:55,477 --> 00:22:01,343
Yah. Normally, the fastest runner is supposed to go last.

319
00:22:01,343 --> 00:22:11,001
Did you guys plan wrong?

320
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,021
Oh, are you warming up right now?

321
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:18,001
But, you, Baek Seung Jo, you know how to run a race?

322
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:20,977
I thought you always sit down and read books all the time.

323
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:24,143
It's an exception of you.

324
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:28,643
It should be "unexpected" not "an exception."

325
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,071
Huh?

326
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:33,011
Unexpected or an exception.

327
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:39,143
Hey, Baek Seung Jo! Don't mess with me! I'm not going easy!

328
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:42,643
Oppa...

329
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,143
It's two to zero.

330
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:52,031
Aren't you losing on purpose just to be called "Oppa?"

331
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:58,081
Ah, we're the same age. How am I going to call you "Oppa!"

332
00:22:58,081 --> 00:23:01,177
Clearly...

333
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:03,143
...you said if you win all three rounds.

334
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:07,077
Yes, if we win all three rounds, I will call you "Oppa."

335
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:13,021
So, if my class wins the race, this topic is over.

336
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:13,082
Yup.

337
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:17,343
Players line up!

338
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:18,051
Here, Fighting!

339
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:20,277
Fighting!

340
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:28,001
Fighting!

341
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:42,577
This, okay?

342
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:47,543
- Kids, fighting!- Fighting!

343
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:48,091
100 meters in 15 seconds, right?

344
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:52,143
What? Ah, yes. When I was in middle school?

345
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:56,001
What did you say?

346
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:05,077
We are Class 7! Class 7! Class7!

347
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:05,694
Oh, my!

348
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:10,177
Oppa!

349
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:17,677
Song Ji Oh! Song Ji Oh! Song Ji Oh!

350
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:22,143
Oh...

351
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,643
What to do?

352
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:28,021
Teacher! Hurry and get up! Hurry up!

353
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:32,243
Ha Ni! Trust me! You have me!

354
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:33,977
Aigoo! What to do?

355
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:35,477
Hurry up!

356
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:37,011
This won't do.

357
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,043
Hurry and get up!

358
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:44,041
Faster!

359
00:24:44,041 --> 00:25:19,943
HA NI!

360
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:25,543
Wow! Good! Ha Ni come here! Come to me!

361
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:38,143
See? Did you see it?!

362
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:42,277
Omo! What is this?! Fighting, Ha Ni!

363
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:46,777
Ha Ni!

364
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:50,051
<i>Everyone, don't worry!

365
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,177
I'll be going first.

366
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:57,277
That's right! Keep going!

367
00:25:57,277 --> 00:26:02,477
<i>I'm sorry, but this victory is for Class 7.

368
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:09,081
<i>Joon Gu, I'll believe in you.

369
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:16,277
<i>Oh? What?

370
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:22,143
<i>Baek Seung Jo is looking at me.

371
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:32,743
<i>Baek Seung Jo is looking at me.

372
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:38,743
<i>Baek Seung Jo is smiling at me and holding out his hand.

373
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:51,051
<i>This is the first time.

374
00:26:51,051 --> 00:27:02,277
Fool.

375
00:27:02,277 --> 00:27:04,243
Oh, Ha Ni!

376
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:10,277
Oh Ha Ni! Baton! Baton!

377
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:20,343
Don't worry, okay?

378
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:25,177
- Baek Seung Jo! Baek Seung Jo!- Bong Joon Gu! Bong Joon Gu!

379
00:27:25,177 --> 00:28:04,001
Oh! Joon Gu is really fast!

380
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:06,377
Oh Ha Ni!

381
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:30,077
- Hey! - Our pizza!

382
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:35,377
Baek Seung Jo! Don't think that you've won!

383
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:39,443
This was because of Teacher's fall!

384
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:41,877
Normally, you'd be loud when you lose a fight.

385
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:44,643
What?!

386
00:28:44,643 --> 00:29:00,309
Hey! Hey!

387
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,277
There is no...

388
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:05,543
...pizza.

389
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,091
WHAT?! WHY!

390
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:11,677
A promise is a promise. There is no pizza.

391
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:14,643
- It's because you fell, Teacher! - What are you talking about?

392
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:18,043
I had the good sense to give it to Ha Ni!

393
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:22,011
That's right! Where's Oh Ha Ni?

394
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,051
Ha Ni is over here!

395
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,243
Ha Ni is right here!

396
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:32,677
Teach! Teach! Do something!

397
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:34,577
That's right! You treat us!

398
00:29:34,577 --> 00:29:37,377
- That's right! That's right! - Yeah, treat us!

399
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:42,377
Quiet, will you?!

400
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:44,061
A person can get confused.

401
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:49,243
We were losing completely, but she managed to turn it around.

402
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:50,777
Ha Ni...

403
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:52,061
I'm sorry.

404
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:56,477
I should have stretched my arm out further,

405
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:58,543
but my arm was short.

406
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,077
- Ah. - What is this?

407
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:01,051
Then, you should treat us to pizza!

408
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:05,011
- Treat us! Treat us! - Buy us pizza! Treat us!

409
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,001
Alright, alright! I'll buy you pizza! How much is it?

410
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:09,377
Around $150?

411
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:12,677
Huh? A hundred, a hundred fifty?!

412
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,091
Aish, I don't have that kind of money.

413
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:20,081
I'll buy you pizza.

414
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:26,021
Everyone was so great today! You don't know how much fun I had in the stands.

415
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:30,177
Thanks for letting me have fun in the stands. So, I'll buy you all pizza!

416
00:30:30,177 --> 00:30:33,377
Ah, who... are you?Ah, this person is...

417
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:36,477
Ha Ni's fan! Oh Ha Ni!

418
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:45,004
I came to cheer her on today!

419
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:49,899
Who are you?

420
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:53,143
Who are you?

421
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:59,791
Children!

422
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:13,343
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

423
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:18,826
Aigoo! It hurts!

424
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:24,917
There's not even one part that doesn't hurt.

425
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:37,145
I should put on some Pahss. (pain reliever patches)

426
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,178
You're not sleeping yet?

427
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:43,035
So you were over there?

428
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:53,367
I didn't know.

429
00:31:53,367 --> 00:32:00,000
How long have you been sitting here?

430
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,483
Wow, it's really pretty here!

431
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,252
Did you get sunburned?

432
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:10,064
Huh?

433
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:15,393
Since you were risking your life, you must be hurting.

434
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:16,099
You really did your best.

435
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:20,195
The least I can do is do my best.

436
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:22,032
It must be nice for you...

437
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:25,233
...being good at everything. You even run well.

438
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:29,008
I'm good at basketball and swimming as well.

439
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:31,067
Such a show off.

440
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,867
You seemed upset for a few days.

441
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:37,524
Why'd you give me the baton?

442
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:40,233
You got another trump card in your hand again.

443
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,293
That's right.

444
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,958
All right, I'm fine with you mocking me.

445
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:51,588
You must have suffered a bit from your classmates.

446
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:55,616
Ah, but you know, your mom came and bought us pizza.

447
00:32:55,616 --> 00:32:57,533
So, it was okay.

448
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,049
My mom?

449
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:03,019
Typical, my mom is unstoppable.

450
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:06,383
Other households say that the father or the children are the troublemakers...

451
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:11,133
But in our family, my mom is the troublemaker.

452
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,316
Why?

453
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:17,067
I like your mom a lot. Very much.

454
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,005
You like her that much?

455
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,583
I like her a lot.

456
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:28,356
Even today, she came and bought us pizza, took pictures of us.

457
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,738
I was happy.

458
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:31,867
Are you really happy?

459
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:33,303
Yes.

460
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:37,251
I've never had my mom come to school like that before.

461
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:41,467
She passed away at a young age.

462
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,867
Of course my dad and my grandma came instead.

463
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:52,367
But, although I was grateful, I don't think I was really happy.

464
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:55,649
I wonder if that would make them feel disappointed?

465
00:33:55,649 --> 00:34:12,092
But today, it felt as if my mom really came.

466
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:17,004
Go down and ask for some pain relieving patches.

467
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,001
I'll help with dinner, too.

468
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,067
You should res...

469
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:29,692
Well, I suppose if you're going to live here, you would want to help out.

470
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,267
Also...

471
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,121
Huh?

472
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,447
That...

473
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,008
The thing you were wearing this morning.What is it?

474
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,007
Oh. That. Stinky Butt, Bboong-Bboong.

475
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,167
You don't know it?

476
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:50,467
Oowee boong oowee boong oowee oowee boong boong!

477
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:53,575
It was cute.

478
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:59,933
Fine, make fun if you wish.

479
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:07,467
How can he be so... Making someone feel embarrassed.

480
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,533
But what?

481
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:12,316
What did he say?

482
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:13,816
Ear? (the first part of "cute" sounds like "ear")

483
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:29,002
Did I have no ear?

484
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,009
Ki Dong is always late.

485
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:39,002
Probably because he sells liquor at night.

486
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:42,726
What are you looking at?

487
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:44,677
Ohh, are these the photos you took today?

488
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,433
Today was so much fun.

489
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:50,025
Wow, the pictures came out really well.

490
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,467
Ha Ni is a lot of fun, right?

491
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,847
Yes.

492
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:57,533
Our house feels like a real "home" ever since Ha Ni moved in.

493
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,006
That's right.

494
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:03,044
Seung Jo too. Look at his expression.

495
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:10,467
Except for when he was little, it's been a long time since I've seen this kind of expression on him.

496
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,167
That's true.

497
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:15,116
Before the summer is over,

498
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:18,533
let's go on a vacation somewhere. Why don't we go on an overnight vacation somewhere?

499
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,167
The kids are busy high school seniors.

500
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,067
That's exactly why we should go!

501
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:27,967
Once they submit their college applications, we really won't have a chance to go.

502
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:33,367
You think so?

503
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:37,133
This congratulatory party is a bit late, eh?

504
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:38,467
I suppose.

505
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:42,867
I'm sorry, Ha Ni, we should have done it immediately after your grades came out.

506
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,009
It's okay. I was busy with the sports festival anyway.

507
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:53,009
Wow, so big.

508
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:57,005
Wow, it's so refreshing! What did you say this was?

509
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:58,467
Mo Ri noodles.

510
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,067
What does "mo ri" mean?

511
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:03,267
We put all kinds of seafood in here,

512
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:08,003
and we eat it together with other people. So I named it "Mo Di" noodles (all together).

513
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:12,453
But, the ending of the name kept changing, and it eventually became "Mo Ri" noodles.

514
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:15,733
Ah, so "mo di" means "all" and "together"?

515
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,416
Exactly!

516
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,716
Anyway, Ha Ni,

517
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:23,001
Dad feels so good these days!

518
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:25,126
I'm so proud of my daughter!

519
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:31,433
Really, we're so impressed!

520
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:35,367
And, thank you so much, Seung Jo. You really are impressive.

521
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,233
No.

522
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,005
Oh, no!

523
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:45,049
Getting someone like Seung Jo to tutor her is even more impressive.

524
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:46,367
I'm so thankful!

525
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:50,001
What are you doing? I'm supposed to be saying thank you! Thank you!

526
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,733
Oh, no. It's nothing. Thank you!

527
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:58,004
Stop, your hair will fall (into the food).

528
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:59,733
Look here.

529
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,883
We can't let a night like this pass by without having a round of drinks, right?

530
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:05,033
How about it? Our main star, want a drink?

531
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:10,467
Me too?

532
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:16,849
Sure. Since an adult is giving it to you, just have one drink.

533
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,633
Here!

534
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:21,000
"Tremble, tremble, tremble."

535
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,833
Seung Jo, too.

536
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,009
Then, lift your glasses!

537
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:32,167
A toast to our wonderful children!

538
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:34,007
Cheers!

539
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:40,467
Here.

540
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:44,008
But, Ha Ni, you worked really hard. I was so surprised.

541
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:47,316
You know, Ha Ni's nickname...

542
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:48,009
...is "Noah's Snail".

543
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,033
"Noah's Snail"?

544
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:52,067
Yes. My grandmother used to call me that.

545
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:53,767
The Noah from Noah and the Ark?

546
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:58,008
Exactly! All of the animals got onto that ark, right?

547
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:02,933
But, this snail, no one took care of it.

548
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:08,167
So all night long, the snail inched along tirelessly.

549
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,005
And at last, it finally got onto the ark.

550
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:17,249
I'm pretty good at working towards something for a long time.

551
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,732
Aahhh!

552
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:26,003
I'm not just saying this, but this alcohol doesn't have an ounce of water in it.

553
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:29,733
When you're drinking it, it might seem okay, but it'll hit you all at once.

554
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:33,267
Oh, really?

555
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:38,567
My friend, you like crabs, right? Eat a lot!

556
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:43,533
Man, even when we were young, you always looked out for me. You're still taking care of me like this.

557
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,133
I heard.

558
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,867
When my husband was younger, you always packed a lunch for him.

559
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:50,008
Well, we lived it up a bit.

560
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:54,883
We really stuck together, eh?

561
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,007
We even had a band together.

562
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh? I've never heard about that before.

563
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,333
Ah, we never "had" a band. We just said that we should start one.

564
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:16,528
Should I go get the guitar?

565
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:21,808
<i>Every day with you,

566
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:26,877
<i>I receive the morning sun.

567
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:32,028
<i>Every day with you,

568
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:37,195
<i>I want to open my eyes.

569
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:42,429
<i>Every day with you, Every day with you,

570
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:47,052
<i>just the two of us.

571
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:52,628
<i>- Every day with you, - Every day with you,

572
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:56,995
<i>I want to talk with you.

573
00:40:56,995 --> 00:41:02,095
<i>The street with it raining at dawn.

574
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:07,495
<i>The flaming sun setting in the evening.

575
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:13,162
<i>Everything around us.

576
00:41:13,162 --> 00:41:16,595
<i>I want to share it with you.

577
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:20,895
Oh, Seung Jo, you were here.

578
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,195
<i>Every day with you,

579
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:26,128
All of this is for you, Lord.

580
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:31,395
<i>In the arms of night.

581
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:36,395
<i>- Every day with you, - Every day with you,

582
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:40,895
<i>I want to fall asleep.

583
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:46,062
<i>The streets being rained on during dawn.

584
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:51,295
<i>The flaming sun setting in the evening.

585
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:57,062
<i>Everything around us.

586
00:41:57,062 --> 00:42:04,728
<i>I want to share it with you.

587
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:09,928
<i>- Every day with you, - Every day with you,

588
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:15,095
<i>I want to sleep.

589
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:18,762
<i>Every day with you.

590
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:20,228
<i>Ah, really.

591
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:23,862
<i>Every day with you.

592
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:25,395
<i>Ah, really.

593
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:33,228
<i>Every day with you.</i>

594
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:35,462
Shut up!!

595
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:43,728
Oppa, oppa! Oppa!

596
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,928
You're still as good as ever!

597
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:47,695
You're really good too!

598
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:49,695
This is so much fun!

599
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:52,795
Hey, Seung Jo, why don't you play a song too?

600
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:53,895
Are you drunk?

601
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:57,795
Oh my. Hey, don't act cool and just play a song.

602
00:42:57,795 --> 00:43:00,162
It's alright.

603
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:02,528
Would the great Baek Seung Jo...

604
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:06,695
...sing in an environment like this?

605
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:08,628
Are you drunk?

606
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,862
Drunk?

607
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:12,795
I didn't even finish one glass.

608
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:17,862
Aigoo.

609
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:22,095
Calling me a public menace.

610
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:22,862
Dad.

611
00:43:22,862 --> 00:43:23,928
Yes.

612
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:29,262
He sees me as a pain in the ass.

613
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:30,295
Huh?

614
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:32,928
That means we're living off of them.

615
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:35,495
Really?

616
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:36,762
Is that right?

617
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:38,362
No. That's not it.

618
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:39,596
He's said something right.

619
00:43:39,596 --> 00:43:40,328
Shh.

620
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,795
Baek Eun Jo!

621
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:46,395
Baek Seung Jo, are you that great?

622
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:48,195
If you are great,

623
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:50,795
is it okay to ignore people?

624
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,762
You told me not to say anything about living with you.

625
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:57,662
Then, how do I explain?

626
00:43:57,662 --> 00:44:02,228
In a place with all those people,

627
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:05,128
did you really have to talk like that?

628
00:44:05,128 --> 00:44:07,262
Every time...

629
00:44:07,262 --> 00:44:10,295
You bad guy!

630
00:44:10,295 --> 00:44:10,995
Let's go.

631
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,228
Oh, okay.

632
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:14,562
Look at that, look at that.

633
00:44:14,562 --> 00:44:17,262
Completely ignoring what people say.

634
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:20,228
Always cynical, laughing at others,

635
00:44:20,228 --> 00:44:25,928
and choosing to say only the things that make people feel bad.

636
00:44:25,928 --> 00:44:27,762
I really, completely don't like him.

637
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:30,495
Are you drunk again?

638
00:44:30,495 --> 00:44:34,562
Aigoo.

639
00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:36,695
Ha Ni, you dislike Seung Jo that much?

640
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:39,028
At the sports event,

641
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:43,128
I thought you two looked really good together.

642
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:45,495
I didn't know you disliked him that much.

643
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:49,328
Yes, I don't like him.

644
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:57,552
(Seung Jo's) Mother, father, Eun Jo. I like you all,

645
00:44:57,552 --> 00:45:03,295
but I don't like Baek Seung Jo!

646
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:04,595
Really?

647
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:05,795
Yeah.

648
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:08,062
You're contradicting yourself.

649
00:45:08,062 --> 00:45:09,736
What?

650
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:14,128
"Actually, I don't call you Seung Jo,"

651
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:18,462
"I call you 'The Spirit of the Forest'."

652
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:22,462
"After that day, I was hurt for several days."

653
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:24,162
"I had a rough time."

654
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:24,895
Hey!

655
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:27,828
"At least once, I pass by you in school,"

656
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:32,862
"But, I still want to see you every day."

657
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:36,595
"In my dreams, you're so sweet."

658
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:42,795
Shee, HEY!

659
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:44,195
Stupid jerk!

660
00:45:44,195 --> 00:45:47,995
What is that? Spirit of the Forest?

661
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:53,495
Ha Ni, did you write Seung Jo a letter?

662
00:45:53,495 --> 00:46:00,895
Wait. That guy......it was Seung Jo?

663
00:46:00,895 --> 00:46:03,328
Did you have to go this far?

664
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,862
Did you memorize it to make fun of me?

665
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:08,795
What am I supposed to do if I can memorize it after looking at it once?

666
00:46:08,795 --> 00:46:11,495
Okay.

667
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:14,595
You're weak if you like someone.

668
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:20,862
But, now that's over. It's completely over.

669
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:27,662
The last remaining feelings I had for you, I got rid of them all.

670
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:28,295
Is that so?

671
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,062
Yes.

672
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:38,028
Petty. Since it's dirty and petty, I can't do it anymore.

673
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:44,895
Baek Seung Jo, you! I really don't like you.

674
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:45,562
Oh Ha Ni!

675
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:48,295
Hey, hey, hey.

676
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:51,428
What is this?

677
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:54,228
Stupid jerk!

678
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,462
She's stupid to the bone...

679
00:46:57,462 --> 00:47:00,262
Seung Jo, help her.

680
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:00,928
Me?

681
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:01,862
Then who? Me?

682
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,728
I'm here. I'll take care of her.

683
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:08,462
Get on my back. Get on, get on.

684
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:11,295
Oh my, are you okay?

685
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:16,362
Are you drunk too? It really hit me all at once!

686
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:18,395
See! Hurry.

687
00:47:18,395 --> 00:47:25,328
Oh, annoying.

688
00:47:25,328 --> 00:47:34,128
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

689
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:34,895
Hey, Ki Dong.

690
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,162
Yes?

691
00:47:36,162 --> 00:47:38,495
You think we'll be in-laws?

692
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,895
Oh, is that so?

693
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:44,095
That doesn't make sense. If so, then I'm moving out.

694
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:51,828
There's nothing you can't say.

695
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:55,762
Aigoo. What's wrong?

696
00:47:55,762 --> 00:48:06,328
It's so beautiful!

697
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:13,328
Stupid jerk.

698
00:48:13,328 --> 00:48:16,995
Oh Ha Ni, you're amazing. In the end, you got your piggyback ride.

699
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:21,231
Huh? What did you say?

700
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:29,762
I said Oh Ha Ni is great.

701
00:48:29,762 --> 00:48:35,462
Hey, let me down. Why are you giving me a piggyback ride?

702
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:37,895
You said you got rid of your feelings.

703
00:48:37,895 --> 00:48:42,593
Huh? Yeah, I did. Why?

704
00:48:42,593 --> 00:48:45,862
You did, so why is it beating like that?

705
00:48:45,862 --> 00:48:46,828
What?

706
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:51,562
Are you okay?

707
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:58,728
Heart, your heart.

708
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,695
But...

709
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:03,628
It's more serious than I thought, Oh Ha Ni.

710
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:05,428
What?

711
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:12,562
Well, being like that, do you think you'll be able to have a baby and raise it?

712
00:49:12,562 --> 00:49:15,228
- Hey! - Hey!

713
00:49:15,228 --> 00:49:28,831
- Oh!! - Hey!

714
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:38,962
Oh, I found it!

715
00:49:38,962 --> 00:50:11,737
Ha Ni!

716
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:14,718
You were hanging them in your room.

717
00:50:14,718 --> 00:50:16,584
Aigoo, I was wondering.

718
00:50:16,584 --> 00:50:24,919
Oh, they're all dry.

719
00:50:24,919 --> 00:50:28,216
Strawberries.

720
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:33,384
So cute.

721
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:35,351
Oh, my head.

722
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:36,675
Awake?

723
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:47,551
Wake up and come down to eat.

724
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:49,751
Did you sleep well?

725
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:53,387
I was going to let you rest.

726
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:57,151
Since you're awake, eat and then go back to sleep. I made soup.

727
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,184
Yes.

728
00:50:58,184 --> 00:51:00,284
Come down.

729
00:51:00,284 --> 00:51:06,384
Oh those...

730
00:51:06,384 --> 00:51:13,952
My head hurts.

731
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:29,719
What? Time went by that fast already?

732
00:51:29,719 --> 00:52:41,051
It's more serious than I thought, Oh Ha Ni. Being like that, will you be able to have a baby and raise it?

733
00:52:41,051 --> 00:53:02,406
Yesterday...

734
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:03,318
<i>Omo...

735
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,118
<i>Maybe...

736
00:53:06,118 --> 00:53:19,651
<i>The results are this fast?

737
00:53:19,651 --> 00:53:21,357
Oh! Ha Ni, come here.

738
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:24,379
Since the weather is nice, we're eating out on the terrace.

739
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:30,984
Yes.

740
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:36,618
Alcoholic.

741
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:42,418
The soup is very good. I made it especially for you.

742
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:44,644
Thank you.

743
00:53:44,644 --> 00:53:47,067
Last night, I made a lot of mistakes, didn't I?

744
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:53,151
What do you mean mistakes? It was so much fun because of you.

745
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:54,184
I'll eat well.

746
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:55,451
Eun Jo,

747
00:53:55,451 --> 00:54:03,484
hold on to the jump rope handles tight, jump high, and let your wrists match a rhythm. 1, 2. 1, 2. Got it?

748
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:05,451
- So yummy.- Really?

749
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:12,618
- Eat a lot.- Yes.

750
00:54:12,618 --> 00:54:16,318
Instead of rotating your arms, use your wrists.

751
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,517
It's fine. You just eat, alcoholic.

752
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:23,851
Okay.

753
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:25,551
Aish, I'm not going to do it.

754
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:28,984
Eun Jo, put your elbows in, like this.

755
00:54:28,984 --> 00:54:46,284
If you know it all, you try it.

756
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:58,287
Oh my oh my oh my! Hey, you're really good!

757
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:01,918
Oh!

758
00:55:01,918 --> 00:55:05,284
You're really good!

759
00:55:05,284 --> 00:55:06,418
Oh my, oh my!

760
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:09,418
First, you put your elbows in like this.

761
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:15,084
Then, you jump with one end of your feet. Since you're jumping with your whole foot, it doesn't work.

762
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:17,684
Here, try it.

763
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:19,418
Come here.

764
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:22,084
Hurry!

765
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:23,351
Here.

766
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:30,851
Hold it. Put your elbows in.

767
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:32,851
Put your elbows in more.

768
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:33,618
Good.

769
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:36,484
Oh my, it's working!

770
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:40,951
That's right. I heard you're taking a musical jump rope test. Did you choose a song?

771
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:42,784
I'm going to do "Sunset Glow".

772
00:55:42,784 --> 00:55:45,851
Sunset Glow?

773
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:57,318
Instead of that, try "Jump Jump Jump".

774
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:03,284
That's fun! Eun Jo, do this one.

775
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:05,218
Seung Jo!

776
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:10,718
Isn't Ha Ni really good?

777
00:56:10,718 --> 00:56:12,951
Doing well!

778
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:17,951
Try it.

779
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:20,551
What is that?

780
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:21,696
Oh my.

781
00:56:21,696 --> 00:56:25,424
What is it?

782
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,264
It looks like some kind of socks.

783
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:35,929
Nooo!

784
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:37,763
Really?

785
00:56:37,763 --> 00:56:39,629
Do they really turn on the air conditioning?

786
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,669
Yeah.

787
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:42,429
It's really cold.

788
00:56:42,429 --> 00:56:44,396
I was wearing long sleeves.

789
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:46,534
- And everyone gets a computer? - Yeah.

790
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:52,096
The Internet is super fast. It would be nice to play games on there.

791
00:56:52,096 --> 00:56:57,018
Ha Ni.

792
00:56:57,018 --> 00:57:00,084
Are you rolling your hair?

793
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:03,551
Did you eat yet? Today they had your favorite.

794
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:04,884
I ate already.

795
00:57:04,884 --> 00:57:06,551
Doesn't that punk come on to you in the Special Study Hall?

796
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:08,684
You're the one who comes on to her.

797
00:57:08,684 --> 00:57:12,084
Stop it, you little...

798
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:13,251
Joon Gu,

799
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:15,657
will you get me that book over there?

800
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:17,809
Okay, okay, I got it.

801
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,651
Move!

802
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:22,418
Now you're studying more!

803
00:57:22,418 --> 00:57:28,718
Thank you.

804
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:39,288
Something fell out.

805
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:57,384
What is it?

806
00:57:57,384 --> 00:57:59,518
What?

807
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:12,184
What is it?

808
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:13,084
Hey!

809
00:58:13,084 --> 00:58:14,351
Oh Ha Ni,

810
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:15,618
what is this?

811
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:24,018
Why are you sleeping with Baek Seung Jo?

812
00:58:24,018 --> 00:58:58,551
No, that, we're not sleeping together...

813
00:58:58,551 --> 00:59:02,084
Oh Ha Ni!

814
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:03,584
What? Are they living together?

815
00:59:03,584 --> 00:59:04,784
With Baek Seung Jo?!

816
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:07,518
What's going on? Maybe it's Photoshopped?

817
00:59:07,518 --> 00:59:18,718
No way!

818
00:59:18,718 --> 00:59:25,751
Ha Ni sunbae!

819
00:59:25,751 --> 00:59:28,251
What's up with this?

820
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:34,419
- Weren't Ha Ni and Joon Gu dating?- Then, what's up with Baek Seung Jo?

821
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:40,451
- Poor Joon Gu. - What will Joon Gu do?

822
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,384
House!

823
00:59:41,384 --> 00:59:48,051
You're living in the same house as Baek Seung Jo?!

824
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,218
Hey, hey, hey!

825
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:53,851
How's Baek Seung Jo's house? I heard he's really rich. It's really big, isn't it? It's super nice, isn't it?

826
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:57,118
Your room? How's your room?

827
00:59:57,118 --> 01:00:01,251
I like it.

828
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:04,518
I'm completely curious.

829
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,984
Completely.

830
01:00:06,984 --> 01:00:07,951
Hey!

831
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:09,018
You guys are trying to come over, aren't you?

832
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:12,951
No! Definitely not! Definitely not!

833
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:16,784
- Why?- Definitely not!

834
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:21,618
Oh, how embarrassing.

835
01:00:21,618 --> 01:01:03,884
This can't be.

836
01:01:03,884 --> 01:01:14,318
Ugh, Oh Ha Ni.

837
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:38,151
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net<i>

838
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:43,351
Where?

839
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:46,684
Hey, Baek Eun Jo!

840
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:50,551
He's drowning!

841
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:53,451
Do you want some water?

842
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:55,484
You came all the way here because of Oh Ha Ni?

843
01:01:55,484 --> 01:01:57,618
- Of course! - Okay.

844
01:01:57,618 --> 01:02:02,584
You guys look good together, you and Oh Ha Ni.

845
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:04,784
I can't do this.

846
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:08,184
Yes?

847
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:08,951
Hello.

848
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:10,518
I don't know how to solve this problem.

849
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,318
No.

850
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:12,918
Just this one.

851
01:02:12,918 --> 01:02:15,284
You're going to sleep?

852
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:16,951
I'm sorry.

853
01:02:16,951 --> 01:02:19,484
Hey!

854
01:02:19,484 --> 01:02:22,084
Hello, Teacher!

855
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:24,318
Oh Ha Ni.

856
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:30,884
If this is it, get together when you guys grow up, don't you think?

857
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:32,851
What's wrong, Seung Jo?

858
01:02:32,851 --> 99:59:59,999
Seung Jo Ssi. (addressing him with more respect)

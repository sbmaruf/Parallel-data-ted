the most highly recommended gasolinesold in the west

1085
01:01:00,469 --> 01:01:03,749
the store reader tonight have been takenfrom the confidential records on filed

1086
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:07,099
in the office for further goingoverboard fresno count

1087
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,219
there for us

1088
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:12,369
charlotte overall to prepare the forwardfor a probe

1089
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:16,039
circumstantial evidence of somethingthat the average person has classified

1090
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,859
as an undesirable things

1091
01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:22,359
might have been doing led to believethat circumstantial evidence should not

1092
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,639
be used to convict a man who will followme

1093
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,549
however consider for a moment

1094
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:30,026
many and varied stories that have beentold

1095
01:01:30,026 --> 01:01:33,719
in court by i witnessed this book to acrime

1096
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:36,023
and contrast those boys with being inthis

1097
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:39,149
beautiful evidence of physical fact

1098
01:01:39,149 --> 01:01:42,599
it is significant that in the state ofcalifornia the death penalty has been

1099
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:47,089
assessed only twice on the basis ofcircumferential evidence

1100
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:50,669
and both those cases have come fromfresno county

1101
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:55,139
tonight's story is one of them andalthough this case is bill on appeal

1102
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:59,029
there is little doubt but what but thatthe judgment of the trial court will be

1103
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:00,389
upto

1104
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:17,609

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is another search problem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's assume we have a search graph.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It isn't quite a tree but looks like this.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Obviously in the structure we can reach nodes through multiple paths.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's assume that our search never expands the same node twice.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's also assume this start node is on top. We search down.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And this over here is our goal node.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So left-to-right search, tell me how many nodes

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
breadth first would expand--do count the start and goal node in the final answer.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Give me the same result for a depth-first search.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Again counting the start and the goal node in your answer.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And again give me your answer for breadth-first

13
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and for depth-first in the right-to-left search paradigm.

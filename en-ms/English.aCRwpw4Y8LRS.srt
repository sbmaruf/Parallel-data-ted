1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
I think we have a respectable
sense of how muscles contract

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,520
on the molecular level.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's take a step back now and
just understand how muscles

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,720
look, at least structurally, or
how they relate to things

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,375
that we normally associate
with muscles.

7
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:16,140
So let me draw a flexing
bicep right here.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,890

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,940
That's their elbow and
let's say that's

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,540
their hand right there.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,435
So this is their bicep
and it's flexing.

12
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,130

13
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,890
I think we've all seen diagrams
of what muscles look,

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,820
at least on kind of a macro
level and it's connected to

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,010
the bones at either end.

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,090
Let me draw the bones.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,060
I'm not going to detail where--
so it's connected to

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,060
the bones at either
end by tendons.

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,610
So this right here would
be some bone.

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,910
Right there would be another
bone that it's connected to.

21
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,330
And then this is tendons, which
connects the bones to

22
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,580
the muscles.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,620

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,560
We have the general sense--
connected to two bones, when

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,310
it contracts it moves some part
of our skeletal system.

26
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,025
So we're actually focused
on skeletal muscles.

27
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,780

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,660
The other types are smooth
muscles and cardiac muscles.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,280
Cardiac muscles are those, as
you can imagine, in our heart.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,000
And smooth muscles are-- these
are more involuntary, slow

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,610
moving muscles and things like
our digestive tract.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,740
And I'll do video on that in
the future, but most of the

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,330
time when people say muscles,
we associate them with

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,545
skeletal muscles that move our
skeletal system around, allow

35
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:38,720
us to run and lift and talk
and do and bite things.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,940
So this is what we normally
associate-- let's dig in a

37
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,960
little bit deeper here.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,670
So if I were to take a cross
section of this bicep right

39
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,130
there-- if I were to take a
cross section of that muscle

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,285
right there-- so let
me do it big.

41
00:01:52,285 --> 00:02:06,760

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,400
And then it looks something
like this.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,020
This is the inside of this
muscle over here.

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,960
Now I said back here,
we had our tendon.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,400

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,880
And then there's actually a
covering; there's no strict

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,100
demarcation or dividing line
between the tendon and the

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,100
covering around this muscle,
but that covering is called

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,060
the epimysium and it's really
just connective tissue that

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,450
covers the muscle, kind of
protects it, reduces friction

51
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,120
between the muscle and the
surrounding bone and other

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,620
tissue that might be in this
person's arm right there.

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,960
And then within this muscle, you
have connective tissue on

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,980
the inside.

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,570
Let me do it in another color.

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,820
I'll do it in orange.

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:17,600

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,460
This is called a perimyseum,
and that's also just

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,860
connective tissue inside
of the actual muscle.

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,980

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,780
And then each of these things
that the perimysium is

62
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,700
dividing off-- let me say if we
were to take one of these

63
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,410
things and allow it to go a
little bit further-- so if we

64
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,870
were to take this thing right
here-- what this perimysium is

65
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,800
dividing off-- and if we were to
pull it out-- actually, let

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,260
me do this one right here.

67
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,600
If we were to pull this one out
just like that-- so you

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,050
have the perimysium surrounding
it, right?

69
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,840
This is all perimysium, and
it's just a fancy word for

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,630
connective tissue.

71
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,600
There's other stuff in there.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,940
You could have nerves and you
could have capillaries, all

73
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,920
sorts of stuff because you have
to get blood and neuronal

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,150
signals to your muscles of
entry so it's not just

75
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,680
connective tissue.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,800
It's other things that have to
be able to eventually get to

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,950
your muscle cells.

78
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,320
So each of these-- I guess you'd
call it subfibers, but

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,220
these are pretty big subfibers
of the muscle.

80
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,470
This is called a fascicle.

81
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:35,650

82
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,600
The connective tissue inside of
the fascicle is called the

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,850
endomysium.

84
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,320

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,680
So once again, more connective
tissues, has capillaries in

86
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,650
it, has nerves in it, all of
the things that have to

87
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,370
eventually come in contact
with muscle cells.

88
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,015
We're inside of a
single muscle.

89
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:04,850

90
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,320
All this green connective
tissue is endomysium.

91
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,740

92
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,220
And each of these things that
are in the endomysium are an

93
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,240
actual muscle cell.

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,150
This is an actual muscle cell.

95
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,320
I'll do it in purple.

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,700
So this thing right here-- I can
pull it out a little bit.

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,380

98
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,110
If I pull this out, this is
an actual muscle cell.

99
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,990
This is what we wanted to get
to, but we're going to go even

100
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,610
within the muscle cell to see,
understand how all the myosin

101
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,920
and the actin filaments fit
into that muscle cell.

102
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,595
So this right here is a muscle
cell or a myofiber.

103
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:51,440

104
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,970
The two prefixes you'll see
a lot when dealing with

105
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,010
muscles-- you're going to see
myo, which you can imagine

106
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,710
refers to muscle.

107
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,990
And you're also going to see
the word sarco, like

108
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,930
sarcolemma, or sarcoplasmic
reticulum.

109
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,970
So you're also go see the
prefix sarco and that's

110
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,980
flesh-- so sarcophagus-- or you
can think of other things

111
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,900
that start with sarco.

112
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,850
So sarco is flesh.

113
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,760
Muscle is flesh and
myo is muscle.

114
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,220
So this is myofiber.

115
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,650
This is an actual muscle cell
and so let's zoom in on the

116
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,320
actual muscle.

117
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,490
So let me actually draw it
really a lot bigger here.

118
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,570
So an actual muscle cell
is called a myofiber.

119
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,760
It's called a fiber because it's
longer than it is wide

120
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,380
and they come in various--
let me draw the

121
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,880
myofiber like this.

122
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,600

123
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll take a cross section of
the muscle cell as well.

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,620

125
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,110
And these can be relatively
short-- several hundred

126
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,520
micrometers-- or it could be
quite long-- at least quite

127
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,500
long by cellular standards.

128
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,340
We're talking several
centimeters.

129
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,160
Think of it as a cell.

130
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,330
That's quite a long cell.

131
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,760
Because it's so long,
it actually has to

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,770
have multiple nucleuses.

133
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,280
Actually, to draw the nucleuses,
let me do a better

134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,470
job drawing the myofiber.

135
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,510
I'm going to make little lumps
in the outside membranes where

136
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,740
the nucleuses can fit
on this myofiber.

137
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,330
Remember, this is just one of
these individual muscle cells

138
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,760
and they're really long so they
have multiple nucleuses.

139
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,600
Let me take its cross section
because we're going to go

140
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,800
inside of this muscle cell.

141
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,210
So I said it's multinucleated.

142
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,340
So if we kind of imagine its
membrane being transparent,

143
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,930
there'd be one nucleus over
here, another nucleus over

144
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,200
here, another nucleus
over here, another

145
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,170
nucleus over there.

146
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,630
And the reason why it's
multinucleated is so that over

147
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,830
large distances, you don't have
to wait for proteins to

148
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,980
get all the way from this
nucleus all the way over to

149
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,090
this part of the muscle cell.

150
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,020
You can actually have the DNA
information close to where it

151
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,680
needs to be.

152
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,850
So it's multinucleated.

153
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,735
I read one-- I think it was 30
or so nucleuses per millimeter

154
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,700
of muscle tissue is what
the average is.

155
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,680
I don't know if that's actually
the case, but the

156
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,370
nucleuses are kind of right
under the membrane of the

157
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,610
muscle cell-- and you remember
what that's called from the

158
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,010
last video.

159
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,040
The membrane of the muscle
cell is the sarcolemma.

160
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:31,380

161
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,630
These are the nucleuses.

162
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,770

163
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:43,690
And then if you take the cross
section of that, there are

164
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,070
tubes within that called
myofibrils.

165
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:53,300
So here there's a bunch
of tubes inside

166
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,210
of the actual cell.

167
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,380
Let me pull one of them out.

168
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,050
So I've pulled out one
of these tubes.

169
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,300
This is a myofibril.

170
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,390

171
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,360
And if you were to look at this
under a light microscope,

172
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,380
you'll see it has little
striations on it.

173
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,190
the striations will look
something like that, like

174
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,560
that, like that, and there'll
be little thin ones

175
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,110
like that, like that.

176
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,200
And inside of these myofibrils
is where we'll find our myosin

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,260
and actin filaments.

178
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,170
So let's zoom in over here
on this myofibril.

179
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,910
We'll just keep zooming until we
get to the molecular level.

180
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,300
So this myofibril, which is--
remember, it's inside of the

181
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,220
muscle cell, inside
of the myofiber.

182
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,090
The myofiber is a muscle cell.

183
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,640
Myofibral is a-- you can view
it as a tube inside of the

184
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,580
muscle cell.

185
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,390
These are the things that
are actually doing the

186
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,600
contraction.

187
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,270
So if I were to zoom in on a
myofibril, you're going to see

188
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,830
it-- it's going to look
something like that and it's

189
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,020
going to have those
bands in it.

190
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,040
So the bands are going to look
something like this.

191
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,445
You're going to have these
short bands like that.

192
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:09,710

193
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,170
Then you're going to have wider
bands like that, like

194
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,020
these little dark-- trying my
best to draw them relatively

195
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,410
neatly and there could be a
little line right there.

196
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,670
Then the same thing
repeats over here.

197
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,100
So each of these units of

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,030
repetition is called a sarcomere.

199
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:37,050

200
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,550
And these units of repetition go
from one-- this is called a

201
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,490
Z-line to another Z-line.

202
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,060
And all of this terminology
comes out of when people just

203
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,430
looked under a microscope and
they saw these lines, they

204
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,070
started attaching names to it.

205
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,450
And just so you have the other
terminology-- we'll talk about

206
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,060
how this relates to the myosin
and the actin in a second.

207
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,330
This right here is the A-band.

208
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,720

209
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,410
And then this distance right
here or these parts right

210
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,850
here, these are called
the I-bands.

211
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,380
And we'll talk about really in a
few seconds how that relates

212
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,610
to the mechanisms or the units
that we talked-- or the

213
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,300
molecules that we talked about
in the last video.

214
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,710
So if you were to zoom in here,
if you were to go into

215
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,440
these myofibrils, if you were
to take a cross section of

216
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,060
these myofibrils, what you'll
find is-- if you were to cut

217
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,960
it up, maybe slice it-- if you
were slice it parallel to the

218
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,190
actual screen that you're
looking at, you're going to

219
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,660
see something like this.

220
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,390
So this is going to
be your Z-band.

221
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,110

222
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,540
This is your next Z-band.

223
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,160
So I'm zooming in on
sarcomere now.

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,560
This is another Z-band.

225
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,290
Then you have your
actin filaments.

226
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,920
Now we're getting to that
molecular level

227
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,170
that I talked about.

228
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:17,000

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,250
And then in between the actin
filaments, you have your

230
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,910
myosin filaments.

231
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,700

232
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,540
Remember, the myosin filaments
had those two heads on them.

233
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,670
They each have two heads like
that, that crawl along the

234
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,390
actin filaments.

235
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,260
I'm just drawing a couple of
them and then they're attached

236
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,810
at the middle just like that.

237
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,680
We'll talk about in a second
what happens when the muscle

238
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,650
actually contracts.

239
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,070
And I could draw it
again over here.

240
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,060

241
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,440
So it has many more heads than
what I'm drawing, but this

242
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,070
just gives you an idea
of what's happening.

243
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,010

244
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,320
These are the myosin, I guess,
proteins and they all

245
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,660
intertwined like we saw in the
previous video and then

246
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,460
there'll be another
one over here.

247
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,950
I don't have to draw
in detail.

248
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,890
So you can see immediately that
the A-band corresponds to

249
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,032
where we have our myosin.

250
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:17,260
So this is our A-band
right here.

251
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,100

252
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,680
And there is an overlap.

253
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,780
They do overlap each other, even
in the resting state, but

254
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,070
the I-band is where you
only have actin

255
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,740
filaments, no myosin.

256
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,070

257
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,410
And then the myosin filaments
are held in place by titin,

258
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,460
which you can kind of imagine
as a springy protein.

259
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,186
I want to do it in a different
color than that.

260
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:52,020

261
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,520
So the myosin is held
in place by titin.

262
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,310

263
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,790
It's attached to the
Z-band by titin.

264
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,760
So what happened?

265
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,340
So we have all of these-- when
a neuron excites-- so let me

266
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,600
draw an endpoint of a neuron
right here, the endpoint of an

267
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,470
axon of a neuron right there.

268
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,280
It's a motor neuron.

269
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,960
It's telling this
guy to contract.

270
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,670
You have the action potential.

271
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,460
The action potential travels
along the membrane, really in

272
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,580
all directions.

273
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,860
And then it eventually, if we
look at it from this view,

274
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,690
they have those little
transverse or T-tubules.

275
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,860
They essentially go into the
cell and continue to propagate

276
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,140
the action potential.

277
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,980
Those trigger the sarcoplasmic
reticulum to release calcium.

278
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,580
The calcium attaches to the
troponin that's attached to

279
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,340
these actin filaments that moves
the tropomyosin out of

280
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,290
the way, and then the
crawling can occur.

281
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,130
The myosin can start
using ATP to crawl

282
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,060
along these actin filaments.

283
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,210
And so as you can imagine, as
they crawl along, their power

284
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,050
stroke is going to push-- you
can either view it as the

285
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,130
actin filaments in that way or
you can say that the myosin is

286
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,490
going to want to move in that
direction, but you're pulling

287
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,440
on both sides of
a rope, right?

288
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,040
So the myosin is going to stay
in one place and the actin

289
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,715
filaments are going to
be pulled together.

290
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,610

291
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,740
And that's essentially how the
muscle is contracting.

292
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,830
So we've, hopefully, in this
video, connected the big

293
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,230
picture from the flexing muscle
all the way over here

294
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,920
to exactly what's happening at
the molecular level that we

295
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,000
learned in the last
few videos.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,500
And you can imagine, when this
happens to all of the

297
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,850
myofibrils inside of the muscle,
right, because the

298
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,550
sarcoplasmic reticulum's
releasing calcium generally

299
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,690
into the cytoplasm of-- which
is also called myoplasm,

300
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,110
because we're dealing with
muscle cells-- the cytoplasm

301
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,370
of this muscle cell.

302
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,210
The calcium floods all
of these myofibrils.

303
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,910
It's able to attach to all of
the troponin-- or at least a

304
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,305
lot of the troponin on top of
these actin filaments and then

305
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,000
the whole muscle contracts.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,340
And then when that's done, each
muscle fiber, myofiber,

307
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,030
or each muscle cell
will not have that

308
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,350
much contracting power.

309
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,930
But when you couple it with all
of them that are around

310
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,040
it-- if you just have one,
actually, working, or a few of

311
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,240
them, you'll just
have a twitch.

312
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,710
But if you have all of them
contracting together, then

313
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,270
that's actually going to create
the force to actually

314
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,420
do some work, or actually pull
your bones together, or lift

315
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,920
some weights.

316
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,980
So hopefully you found
that mildly useful.

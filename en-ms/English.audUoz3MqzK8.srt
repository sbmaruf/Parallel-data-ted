1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,950
Evaluate 1x when x is equal to
negative 1, x is equal to 0,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,950
and x is equal to 1.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,590
So let's do the scenario
x is equal to negative 1.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,030
Then 1x becomes 1 times x,
which is now negative 1.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,759
So it's 1 times negative 1.

7
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,800
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,270
1 times anything is going
to be that anything.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,509
So 1 times negative 1 is going
to be equal to negative 1.

10
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,300
Another way you could
have thought about it

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,274
is you could've just looked
at the absolute value

12
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:36,940
of both numbers.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,800
You'd say 1 times 1 is 1.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,010
They have different signs.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,218
So it's going to be negative.

16
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,890
It would have gotten you
the same answer either way.

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,350
Now we have the scenario
where x is equal to 0.

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,610
So 1 times x is going to be
the same thing as 1 times 0.

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,020
We've substituted a 0 for x.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,520
Once again, 1 times anything is
going to become that anything.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,270
So this is going to become 0.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,140
Another way to think about
it is 0 times anything

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,010
is going to become 0.

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,134
So either one of those
ways of thinking about it

25
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,550
would have gotten
you this answer.

26
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,220
1 times-- actually,
we could even

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,752
write 1 times x is equal to x.

28
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:17,460
So really, when you
evaluate any of these

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,450
at x is equal to negative 1, or
x is equal to 0, or x equals 1,

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,450
it's really just going
to equal that number

31
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,730
because 1 times anything
is equal to that anything

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,560
right over there.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,610
Just to make it clear, 0
times anything is equal to--

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,770
and this x here is a variable
not a multiplication sign-- 0

35
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,720
times anything is equal to 0.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,790
Just for good measure--
we kind of already

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,530
went over the answer-- but
let's try x is equal to 1.

38
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,330
So this will give us 1 times
1, which you've probably

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,770
learned a while ago.

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,830
But 1 times anything is
equal to that number.

41
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,390
So it's equal to 1.

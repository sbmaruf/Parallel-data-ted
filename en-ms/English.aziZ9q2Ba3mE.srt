1
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:16,325
20,000 years ago, the world suffered in the depths of the last ice age.

2
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,681
For several thousand years,

3
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,348
global average temperatures stayed 15 degrees Fahrenheit,

4
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:30,681
that's about 8 degrees celcius below what they're today,

5
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:38,218
and mile thick glaciers covered much of North America, Europe, and Asia;

6
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:48,203
outside the ice-covered regions, it was so dry that survival became difficult in most areas.

7
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:55,211
Some areas where people'd been living became inhospitable,

8
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:04,466
and in some other places, new barriers of ice or desert separated groups of people,

9
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:16,212
but against all odds, some people found ways to survive in severe conditions as far north as Siberia.

10
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:25,399
The ice age not only created barriers, it also created bridges

11
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:31,198
with so much water locked up in ice, sea levels dropped,

12
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:36,048
exposing land and connected Siberia and Alaska,

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,218
a few people in Siberia took advantage of this bridge,

14
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:48,321
moving into present-day Alaska, and later, down into other parts of North America,

15
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,823
maybe they followed migrating herds

16
00:01:57,223 --> 00:02:02,803
or maybe, they traveled in small boats, down the Pacific coast,

17
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,772
or maybe they did both.

18
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,364
No matter how they got there,

19
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:17,591
those people who get there became the ancestors of today's Americans.

20
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:28,431
In just a short time, humans from a small corner of Africa had populated all continents

21
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,214
except Antarctica,

22
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:39,764
and in there new homes, their languages began to differentiate to form the precursors of today's languages.

23
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:46,247
Some populations probably didn't survived the ice age

24
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:51,895
and those that did often became more isolated from other groups,

25
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:58,145
scattered around the world, these small populations

26
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:03,797
became more being culturally, and genetically distinct from one another.

27
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:12,820
How would cultural innovations helped a few of these groups

28
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,870
to expand dramatically over the next several thousands years.

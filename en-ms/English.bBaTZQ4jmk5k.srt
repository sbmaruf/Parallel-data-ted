00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,580
Have you ever wondered how the earth stays
in orbit around the sun? I mean, the pull

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,760
of gravity is stronger the closer you are
to the sun, so you'd think that if the earth

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,919
got bumped slightly towards the sun (like,
if you jumped, or something), then the sun

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,349
would pull just a little bit stronger, tugging
the earth yet closer still, at which point

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,899
the sun's pull would be stronger yet again,
… and the earth would spiral in to its eventual

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,690
doom.

7
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:20,719
But you and I and swiss cheese are clearly
evidence that the earth doesn't just spiral

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,700
in to its doom – so why not? Well, when
the earth does get pushed a little bit towards

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,549
the sun, the sun's pull speeds it up a little
bit, too - so even though the nearby sun's

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,030
pull is stronger, the earth will be going
fast enough that it overshoots and ends up

11
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,109
farther away from the sun. Of course, the
sun's pull slows it down again in the process…

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,040
at which point the earth turns back and starts
the cycle all over again.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,210
The amazing thing is that the two effects
of speeding up plus stronger gravitational

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,130
attraction perfectly balance, so that the
earth stays in its orbit the same way a marble

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,120
stays at the bottom of a bowl even if it gets
knocked around a little bit.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,010
This balance is very special indeed - it's
highly dependent on the strength of the gravitational

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,890
force and the number of dimensions we live
in, and in fact, these stable orbits only

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,040
exist in a three dimensional universe.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,250
The details are a bit subtle, but if gravity
were just slightly steeper, as it would be

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,970
if we lived in four spatial dimensions, you
could never orbit the sun because you'd get

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,160
pulled in without picking up enough speed
to escape and you WOULD spiral in to your

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,690
doom. And if we lived in fewer dimensions
so that gravity were a bit tamer, then you

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,760
could ALSO never orbit the sun, because as
you approached it, you wouldn't be pulled

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,510
enough and would merely pass by with your
path slightly bent.

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,670
So we're incredibly lucky to live in a three
dimensional universe where there ARE stable

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,670
orbits that allow planets, solar systems,
and galaxies to exist at all! Thank you, stable

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,160
orbits, for without you, life as we know it,
and especially cheese, would be impossible.

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,419
ps An awesome down-to-earth example of stable
orbits are the hyperbolic funnels that you

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,390
often see at museums or in shopping malls:
the physics is almost identical to the stable

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,740
orbits of planets, satellites, and moons,
and the only reason the coins in the funnels

31
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,050
(or satellites around the earth) eventually
DO spiral in to their doom is because they

32
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,479
lose energy to friction and thus shift down
from one stable orbit to another, until eventually,

33
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,209
their orbit coincides with the ground. Which
is called crashing.

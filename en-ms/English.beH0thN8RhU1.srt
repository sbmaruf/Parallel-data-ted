1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
starts with a conversation.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I would like to share with you

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
with too much time on my hands.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that I built in my bedroom,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
much to the dismay of my mother.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
YB: To the dismay of my mother,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
(Laughter)

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
FN: And I brought this all together,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
also the U.S. and Japan.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We had a lot that got us excited.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So we decided to do a special project together.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To combine engineering and design and ...

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
YB: And we made a baby.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
(Laughter)

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
FN: Can you bring out our baby?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
(Applause)

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This baby is fully electric.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It goes 150 miles an hour.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's got an amazing user experience.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And we've only got three minutes,

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but we could talk about it for hours.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
YB: Thank you.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
(Applause)

00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,000
Last time...

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,000
It was supposed to be a standard mission.  Get in.  Get out.  Get paid.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,000
Now my men are dead.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,000
Who killed my mates?

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,000
The name is Bobby-

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,000
Kotickovich!

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,000
ActivistSun is proud to announce our acquisition of Outer Heaven.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,000
Liquid and Makarov are creating a new weapon.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,000
Modern Gear!

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,000
The Boss is arming Modern Gear as we speak.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,000
Act 3:  Sun Down

13
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,000
Sorry it's taken so long.

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,000
But I've finally found him.

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,000
That bastard who betrayed us.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,000
His name…is Bobby Kotickovich.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,000
Isn't he that guy that clubs baby seals?

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, yes, but he's also the head of ActivistSun.

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,000
A powerful shadow military.

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000
And it's our job to bring them to light.

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,000
Kotickovich has stayed one step ahead of us.

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,000
But we've tracked him down.

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,000
Booyah!

24
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,300
It wasn't hard to follow the trail of bodies.

25
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,000
We believe he's using this abandoned arms depot to launch his new weapon.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,000
Modern Gear!

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,000
Once Modern Gear is finished, Kotickovich will be unstoppable.

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,000
We have to face reality.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,000
It's unlikely that you'll be coming back from this mission.

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,000
But when they speak of this moment

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,000
It won't be us that stood idly by while Kotickovich destroys everything we stand for.

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,000
Snake.  Ghost.

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,000
The fate of the world is in your hands now.

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,000
I won't stop until I've brought that bastard down.

35
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,000
I swear it.

36
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,000
You will be avenged.

37
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,000
No matter what the cost.

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,000
Even if I have to sacrifice everything.

39
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,000
We're not sending you in empty-handed.

40
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,000
We've been working on some new gear for you.

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,000
Whoah, what is it!?

42
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,000
I hope it's a puppy.  I'm gonna name it Solid Dog.

43
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,000
(Ghost:) Oh yeah, nice one brother!

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,000
Whoah!

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,000
Sweet!  Thanks Naomi!

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,000
We got something for you too, Ghost.

47
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh thanks mate, you shouldn't have-

48
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,000
-Uhhhhh. . . . .alright.

49
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a bit small, innit?

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,000
Uhh…

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,000
I thought they’d go well with your mask.

52
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,000
(sigh)

53
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, try them on!

54
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,000
(sigh)

55
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,000
(Snake hums)

56
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,000
This may be a suicide mission.

57
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,000
But the world will remember us…for this.

58
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,000
We…will…kill him!

59
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,000
(Snake:) In position.

60
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't you just love this weather?

61
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,000
Make's you feel good to be alive.

62
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,000
Hey, what is that?

63
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,000
Awww, it's just a box.

64
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,000
What's it doing out here?

65
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,000
Beats me.

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,000
Did you order anything?

67
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

68
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey, you cardboard son of a-

69
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,000
Hello!

70
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,000
Sleepy time!

71
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,300
Moving out.

72
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,000
Got you covered!

73
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

74
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,000
Clear!

75
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,000
Watch your corners. Kotickovich could be anywhere.

76
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm gonna kick his puny ass.

77
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,000
Clear!

78
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,000
Whoah.

79
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,300
Do you hear something?

80
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,000
(industrial noises)

81
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,000
Holy --CENSORED-- What is that!?

82
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,000
Modern Gear

83
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, this was a bad idea….

84
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,000
(snake groans)

85
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,000
Well well well, look what we have here!

86
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,200
Snake and Ghost!

87
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,000
Kotickovich!

88
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,000
We have some unfinished business, you and I, Ghost!

89
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,000
Right, I forgot to send you back to hell!

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,000
Seriously, is that it?

91
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,000
Is that all you got?  My turn!

92
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,000
Aw crap.

93
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,200
How do you not see him!?

94
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,000
Where are you going, Ghost?

95
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,000
(evil laughter)

96
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh crap!  Crap!  CRAP!

97
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,100
No. No! NO!

98
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,000
Oy, toaster oven!  Where's my pop-tarts?

99
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey, that's not my name!

100
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,000
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!

101
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,200
Die already!

102
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh crap!

103
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,000
Stop hiding, Ghost!

104
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh no.  Damn it!

105
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,000
This is not gonna work.

106
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh crap- oh crap- oh crap- oh crap- oh crap- oh crap!

107
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh this is not fair!

108
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,000
Come on Ghost!

109
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,000
No.  It can't end like this.

110
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,000
(Ghost yells)

111
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,000
Ghost!  Come out and play!

112
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm gonna finish what I started with your team!

113
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,000
What's this?

114
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,000
(Ghost laughs)  Oh yeah!

115
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,000
It's been a long time, old friend.

116
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,000
On the next episode…

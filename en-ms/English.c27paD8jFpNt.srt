1
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:12,874
Hey. Hey Square.

2
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:17,068
Where have you been all this time?

3
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:21,394
With you we sang. And with you we labored.

4
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:25,394
We fought our fears. And we prayed.

5
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:29,883
All as one hand. Day and night.

6
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:34,385
And with you nothing is impossible.

7
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:38,837
The voice of freedom brings us together.

8
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:43,237
Finally our lives have a meaning.

9
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:47,680
There is no going back. Our voices are heard.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,880
And the dream is not forbidden anymore.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,338
Hey. Hey Square.

12
00:00:56,338 --> 00:01:00,794
Where have you been all this time?

13
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,754
You brought down the wall. You lit the light.

14
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:09,640
You gathered around you a broken people.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,080
We were born anew.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,606
And a stubborn dream has been born.

17
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:22,563
We've disagreed with good intentions.

18
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:26,745
Sometimes things weren't clear.

19
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:31,291
We'll protect our country and our children's children.

20
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:36,388
We'll protect the rights of the lost lives of our youth.

21
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,982
Hey. Hey Square.

22
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:44,188
Where have you been all this time?

23
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,720
With you we felt and started

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,880
After we had been far and had come to the end.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,258
We have to change ourselves with our hands.

26
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:01,695
You gave us a lot and the rest is up to us.

27
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:06,280
Sometime I worry that you'll become a memory.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,526
That you'll become distant from us and the idea will die.

29
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:14,974
And we'll go back and forget what happened.

30
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:19,720
And tell stories about you in our tales.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,677
Hey. Hey Square.

32
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:27,775
Where have you been all this time?

33
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:32,760
The Square is full. With all kinds.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,880
The reckless one. And the courageous.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,320
There is the passionate one. And the one who are on a ride.

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,080
The loud one. The quiet one.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,960
We get together. Drink tea.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,877
We now know how to get our rights.

39
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:58,538
You let the world hear us.

40
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:03,746
And you let the neighbors get together.

41
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:07,600
Hey. Hey Square.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,803
Where have you been all this time?

43
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:16,292
Our idea is our strength.

44
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:21,228
Our weapon is our unity.

45
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:24,554
The square says the truth.

46
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:29,452
It always says no the oppressor.

47
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:33,280
The square is like a wave.

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,337
There are people riding it. Others are pulled in by it.

49
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:42,440
People outside of it calling it chaotic.

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,265
And what has been done is now written.

51
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:50,882
Hey. Hey Square.

52
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:55,409
Where have you been all this time?

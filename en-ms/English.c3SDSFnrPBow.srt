00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:10,800
Rewrite the equation 6x^2 + 3 = 2x - 6 in standard form and identify a, b, and c.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:19,585
So standard form for a quadratic equation is ax squared plus bx plus c is equal to zero.

3
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:23,333
So essentially you wanna get all of the terms on the left-hand side,

4
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:29,585
and then we want to write them so that we have the x terms...where their exponents are in decreasing order.

5
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:33,502
So we have the x squared term and then the x term and then we have the constant term.

6
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,477
So let's try to do this over here.

7
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,677
So let me rewrite our original equation.

8
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:43,190
We have 6x squared plus 3 is equal to 2x minus 6.

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,692
So essentially we wanna get everything on the left-hand side.

10
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:51,333
so I could subtract 2x from both sides, so I could subtract 2x from both sides,

11
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,815
so let me just...I'll take one step at a time.

12
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:56,462
So I can subtract 2x from both sides.

13
00:00:56,462 --> 00:01:01,015
And then I'll get...and I'm gonna write it in descending order for the exponents on x.

14
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:04,302
So the highest exponent is x squared. So I'll write that first.

15
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:10,671
6x squared, and then we have minus 2x, and then we have plus 3 is equal to...

16
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,492
the 2 'x's on the right cancel out...equal to negative 6.

17
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:20,000
And now, to get rid of this negative 6 on the right-hand side, we can add 6 to both sides.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,318
So let's add 6 to both sides...

19
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:32,431
...and then this simplifies to 6x squared, minus 2x, plus nine is equal to...zero.

20
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,877
So let's make sure we're already in standard form.

21
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:40,775
All of our terms, our non-zero terms are on the left-hand side, we've done that.

22
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,010
We have a zero on the right-hand side, we've done that.

23
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,559
And, we have the x squared term first, then the x to the first power term, then the constant term.

24
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,323
x squared, then x to the first, then the constant term.

25
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:53,575
So we are in standard form.

26
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:58,252
And so we can say that a is equal to 6, a is equal to 6.

27
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:04,031
We could say that b is equal to, and this is key, it's not just the 2, it's the negative 2.

28
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:10,087
B is equal to negative 2, 'cause notice this says plus bx, but over here we have minus 2x.

29
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:14,600
So the b is a negative 2 here. B is negative 2.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 99:59:59,999
And then c, c is going to be, c is going to be 9.

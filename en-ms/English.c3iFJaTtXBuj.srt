1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,380
Draw a circle and label the
radius, diameter, center,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,740
and the circumference.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,427
Let me draw a circle.

5
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:10,260
And it won't be that
well drawn of a circle,

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,468
but I think you get the idea.

7
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:13,220
So that is my circle.

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm going to label
the center over here.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,210
I'll do the center.

10
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,170
I'll call it c.

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,850
So that is my center.

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,240
And I'll draw an arrow there.

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,530
That is the center
of the circle.

14
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,660
And actually, the
circle itself is the set

15
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,680
of all points that are a fixed
distance away from that center.

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,630
And that fixed distance
away that they're

17
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,460
all from that center,
that is the radius.

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,690
So let me draw the radius.

19
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,960
So this distance right
over here is the radius.

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,190
That is the radius.

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,550
And that's going to be the
same as this distance, which

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,240
is the same as that distance.

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,850
I can draw multiple radii.

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,930
All of these are radii, the
distance between the center

25
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,810
and any point on the circle.

26
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,060
Now, a diameter just goes
straight across the circle,

27
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,700
going through the center.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,819
From one side of the
circle to the other side,

29
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,770
I'm going through the center.

30
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,050
It's essentially two
radii put together.

31
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,060
So for example, this
would be a diameter.

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,702
You have one radii, than
another radii, all one line,

33
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:20,660
going from one side of
the circle to the other,

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,340
going through the center.

35
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,070
So that is a diameter.

36
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,449

37
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:27,990
And I could have
drawn it other ways.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,410
I could've drawn it like this.

39
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,790
That would be another diameter.

40
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,790
But they're going to have
the exact same length.

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,340
And finally, we have to think
about the circumference.

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,650
And the circumference
is really just how far

43
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,780
you have to go to go
around the circle.

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,880
Or if you put a
string on this circle,

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,770
how long will that
string have to be?

46
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,550
So what I'm tracing
out in blue right now,

47
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,150
the length of what I'm tracing
out, is the circumference.

48
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,790
So right over here, that
is the circumference.

49
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,040

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,950
And we're done.

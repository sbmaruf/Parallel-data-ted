<i>Episode 4

3
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:21,475
Is it that house?

4
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:35,133
That's enough, okay? Hurry and leave! If Baek Seung Jo sees us, we're dead.

5
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,086
Hurry, hurry.

6
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:37,933
Where's your room ?

7
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,794
Is it over there? Or there? Where is it?

8
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:42,367
Spare me, please!

9
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:43,833
It seems like it's over there. Right there.

10
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:48,333
If that's Ha Ni's room, that one must be Baek Seung Jo's room?!

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:53,633
Please, please! Spare me! Just go already!

12
00:00:53,633 --> 00:01:01,007
Ha Ni, you came?

13
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,267
You're here early!

14
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:04,495
Ah, yes.

15
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,333
Why aren't you coming in?

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,133
Well, today is just...

17
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,449
Are they your friends ?

18
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:13,867
Ah, hello.

19
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:17,007
Ah! You, you're Lady Gaga, right?

20
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,967
Oh, yes.

21
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:22,005
Aaah, the pizza lady!

22
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,567
That's right!

23
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,005
Ah! Hello.

24
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,733
And you?

25
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,033
You're the friend who was in the relay.Right?

26
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:36,533
Yes. Hello.

27
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,667
They were curious about where I'm living,

28
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:43,467
but they're leaving now, right? Bye!

29
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:47,667
Omo, go where? Come in.

30
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:48,133
Okay.

31
00:01:48,133 --> 00:02:14,007
Shall I make some strawberry Bingsu (a mixture of fruits, ice cream and shaved ice) for you? You can leave after you eat it.

32
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,001
Aigoo!

33
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:23,208
Aigoo!

34
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:29,167
Oh! This looks really delicious!

35
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:34,333
Really? For real?

36
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,004
You're just loving this, aren't you?

37
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,333
Oh! Son, you came?

38
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,448
Hyung!

39
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:45,133
Spreading rumors wasn't enough, so you even brought them here?

40
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,533
No, that's...

41
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,033
You should know I've already scolded her.

42
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,333
Is this your house?

43
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,667
I invited them in.

44
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:57,133
It's so much fun! It feels like there are actually people living here.

45
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:04,533
But these friends asked me if I'm really your mom. They asked if I'm not really your older sister.

46
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh Ha Ni.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,733
Are you testing my patience?

48
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,433
Oh?

49
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,845
I told you to stop doing this to me.

50
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:14,967
And not to interfere with my life anymore!

51
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,723
How far do you intend to go with this?

52
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:20,003
Just give it a rest!

53
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:21,009
What do you think you're doing now?

54
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:24,001
It was me who took that picture,

55
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,967
and it was me who put that picture in the book without telling anyone. Why are you scolding Ha Ni?!

56
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,002
You too, Mom, please!

57
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,002
Take down that blog right this instant.

58
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,967
Omo?

59
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,333
What makes you so mighty that you can tell me what to do with my hobby?

60
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:44,267
Is ruining your son's life really your hobby?

61
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:48,233
By chance, I heard what's going around school.

62
00:03:48,233 --> 00:04:03,004
So what if rumors were to spread? What's there to feel sorry about?

63
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:05,533
Then, we will...

64
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:05,967
...be leaving now.

65
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:08,567
Ah, why? You should have dinner with us.

66
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,367
- Ah, no it's alright.-Goodbye.

67
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:15,767
Ah, why? You should stay and have dinner here!

68
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:21,033
Ah, right! This weekend, we're going to the beach.

69
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:24,004
Let's go together!

70
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,033
Sorry?

71
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,009
But we have class this week.

72
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:29,008
Omo! It's okay to miss just one day.

73
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:31,005
Oh! It's going to be fun!

74
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,933
You girls only need to prepare your bathing suits

75
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,067
because I'll prepare everything else!

76
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:44,133
Okay?!

77
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,667
Oh come on, please come on!

78
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:51,262
Don't ask me the reason. Can't you just do it for me?

79
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:54,167
Why? Did you mess something up again?!

80
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,433
No.

81
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:59,004
Perhaps, are you sick?

82
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:01,009
Ah no, I'm not sick at all.

83
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,833
Fine then. How much do you need?

84
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:11,008
Ah, 1,000? No, no. 2,000? Ah, no, no. 3,000?! Yes, 3,000 would be good!

85
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:13,004
3,000?!

86
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:20,133
Just think of it as spending money for my wedding just a little early. I just need 3,000.

87
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,967
Will 3,000 be enough?

88
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,833
Yes, 3,000 will be fine!

89
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,009
Then, I'll give it to you!

90
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:31,333
Oh really?! Thank you so much, Father!

91
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,133
But, why are you so worked up over 3,000 won (about $2.50)?

92
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,009
Ah, the truth is...

93
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,367
I wanted to get a room.

94
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:42,233
What?! 3,000, 3,000 won?

95
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,633
Father, are you kidding me right now?!

96
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,433
Kidding? You punk?!

97
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:50,003
You little ungrateful, shameless rascal! Are you crazy?!

98
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:56,767
You little punk! You want 30,000,000 won ($25,600)!? Are you stupid? For what? To rent a room?

99
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,533
Don't waste your time on such unnecessary things and go do something productive.

100
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:07,004
I'm going to hang up now. HANG UP!

101
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:10,633
Don't you know that in order to protect your love you need to have money?

102
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,633
Aish! Shut up!

103
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,333
Oh, what a fright!

104
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,007
Would you move from there?

105
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:23,005
That is my place, young man.

106
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:30,002
Oh! What's this, ahjussi? So smelly!

107
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:35,008
Why did you lose your love, young one? Because of money?

108
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,833
Forget it! Just go back to sleep!

109
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:42,533
Love is lonely because fate is on the line.

110
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,008
One puts everything on the line, which is why it's lonely.

111
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,867
What?

112
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:52,933
When living life is hard and you feel alone,

113
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:56,467
love is what makes such a world look beautiful.

114
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,006
Excuse me?

115
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:07,733
You say that because you don't realize how lonely that kind of love makes oneself.

116
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:12,167
But......does that mean you should give up on love?

117
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,002
Such a bright youth!

118
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,733
Wouldn't you feel sorry towards (Van) Gogh who lived his life more unhappily than we do ours?

119
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:29,867
What? Gogh?

120
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,004
Do you know about Gogh's love?

121
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,008
Putting everything you have on the line.

122
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:38,567
To have no regrets despite losing everything.

123
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:45,067
You must be able to do that in order to really say that you've been in love.

124
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:57,633
Wait, wait! Can't you tell me anything else?!

125
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,533
That's right! Bong Joon Gu.

126
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,933
Can you really say your love has been tested by fate?

127
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:08,067
You still haven't even properly confessed your feelings to Ha Ni!

128
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,006
And even if you had,

129
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:14,007
what would be the point?

130
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:46,000
To not regret loving despite losing everything.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,467
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

132
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:51,007
While you've been living here there's something I've really come to hate.

133
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:56,267
People with a bad head, like you,

134
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,002
who aren't able to take in the situation, let alone understand their own situation,

135
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:02,167
acting as if they know what's going on and bothering other people.

136
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,067
Don't make me repeat myself.

137
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:27,002
What I said about you being out of your mind wasn't just empty words.

138
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:30,333
<i>Because of the letter,

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:42,005
<i>he embarrassed me in front of all those students and teachers. Even after going through such shame, I didn't cry.

140
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:46,867
No, it's alright. It's totally understandable.

141
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,533
He has every right to do so.

142
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:56,267
He must be thinking that I planned everything out.

143
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,009
(Sigh!)

144
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,233
I said that's not how it is!

145
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,833
If I were him, I would be really angry too!

146
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,567
It must've been a pretty big shock.

147
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:20,013
Alright, bye!

148
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:22,055
Oh Ha Ni?

149
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:26,047
Are you Oh Ha Ni?

150
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:34,669
I hate stupid girls.

I'm telling you not to interfere with my life anymore!

163
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,437
How far do you want to keep going with this?!

164
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,103
Will you give it up!?

165
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:26,001
<i> Every day stay by my side and protect me.

166
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:30,077
<i> I love you too much for us to be just friends.

167
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:36,017
<i> So can you please tell me that one word, I love you right now?

168
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:40,737
<i>I love every day, only love me,

169
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:47,473
<i> Please kiss me.

170
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,603
It really looks pretty!

171
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:49,545
Um.

172
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:50,903
How is it?

173
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:55,203


174
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:56,237
Hi!

175
00:11:56,237 --> 00:12:02,503
Seung Jo, you came down.

176
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:04,409
They said they're ready and that we should come out.

177
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,047
Oh, really?

178
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:09,914
Then shall we get going?

179
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:11,837
Seung Jo, you too. Put your bag down and quickly come with us!

180
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:12,737
Go?

181
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:13,087
Go where?

182
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:17,603
We're going camping for two days and one night.

183
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,007
I present you...

184
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,027
Auto-Camping.

185
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,403
What?

186
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,537
What about school?

187
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:30,803
I already called them.

188
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:33,003
Hyung, I've been kidnapped!

189
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,016
I woke up and found myself in the car!

190
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:36,499
Come out quickly.

191
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:40,103
That is the only way to save his life.

192
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,211
Quickly! I've already packed your luggage.

193
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,237
Your bathing suit too!

194
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:50,749
You are too much, seriously.

195
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:51,603
Who is it?!

196
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:57,303
Ha Ni! This girl suddenly says she's coming too.

197
00:12:57,303 --> 00:13:00,027
Hello! I'm comming too!

198
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:07,057
Who is she?

199
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,077
Hey.

200
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:10,503
What is this? Why isn't she here yet?

201
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,037
None of them are here.

202
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,603
Argh, really!

203
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:20,137
Good morning!

204
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,403
Nothing going on, right?

205
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,703
Teacher, Ha Ni isn't here yet!

206
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,903
Go Min Ah isn't here either.

207
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:25,087
Jung Ju Ri as well!

208
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,097
They've all gone to have fun.

209
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,103
They said they're going to the beach! Jealous, right?!

210
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,603
Gone to have fun you said?

211
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,837
Teacher, do you know how scary this world is?!

212
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,803
How could you allow three girls to go to the beach alone?!

213
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:41,087
It wasn't just the girls; they all went with Baek Seung Jo's family.

214
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:49,203
Did you say Baek...BAEK SEUNG JO?!

215
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,803
Just kill me instead! Kill me!

216
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,087
What? They went on a trip?!

217
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:56,403
And to add to that, for one night and two days?!

218
00:13:56,403 --> 00:14:02,087
What am I going to do?

219
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:06,937
Am I going to have to earn some money?

220
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:18,003
Argh! What to do now?

221
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:19,037
What is it, Bong Joon Gu?

222
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:21,017
You, did you just get here?!

223
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:23,037
That's not it, Sir.

224
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,913
I'm in a rush and am leaving early.

225
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:26,303
Leaving early?!

226
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,737
Vice Principal, you see...

227
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:35,919
Aigoo, my aunt got into a traffic accident so suddenly!

228
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,027
I have to go really quickly now.

229
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:42,027
R-really? Then hurry up and go.

230
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,282
Ah yes.

231
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:49,203
Aigoo, but although I have to go really quickly, I have no money!

232
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:53,607
Can I borrow this just this once?

233
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,049
Aigoo, this?!

234
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,303
Yes. They said she might pass away any second!

235
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:03,337
Man, even if this is a piece of crap, it's still something!

236
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,537
The heavens are definitely on my side!

237
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:10,803
Ha Ni, I'm coming!

238
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,737
Okay, kids, raise your hands!

239
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:15,803
Quickly cross the road! It's dangerous.

240
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:18,078
Aigoo, how cute they are!

241
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,253
Alright, let's go!

242
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:20,837
Oppa! Oppa!

243
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,437
Oh. What is it?

244
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:23,918
We just opened right next to the subway station.

245
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:24,603


246
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:27,503
Here. Be sure to come and have fun!!

247
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:28,437
But I'm still a student.

248
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:31,338
Many university students come as well.

249
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,437
But, Oppa, you're really cute.

250
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:35,441
Ah, yes, thank you.

251
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:40,903
You should definitely come!

252
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:42,537
Massage Palace?

253
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:44,027
Eh? What's that?

254
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,337
Protect the youth.

255
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,403
Is this a good thing?

256
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:51,314
Yaah, really!

257
00:15:51,314 --> 00:16:04,007
Let's go!

258
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:10,037
Ah.

259
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,203
Oppa, do you want to eat some watermelon? I cut it up nicely so it's easy to eat!

260
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,637
There's a ridiculous amount of watermelon in the fridge.

261
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:19,047
Oh, but mine is super sweet! It tastes like honey!

262
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:23,029
A watermelon should taste like watermelon.

263
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:29,503
If it tastes like honey, how could it be watermelon? Wouldn't it be honey?!

264
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:34,637
So, how did you know we were going to the beach?

265
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:40,141
Everyone has their ways.

266
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:42,137
First, you need to have a bathing suit.

267
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:46,067
Ah, also hairspray and a hairdryer and...

268
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,503
And what else?

269
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,037
Ha Ni, do you have a swimsuit?

270
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,936
Yeah. I bought it last year, remember?

271
00:16:52,936 --> 00:17:04,437
Hey! Just buy a new one!

272
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:07,161
Omo, there is even a Noraebang (Karaoke) there?

273
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,703
Should we try out a song, Oppa?!

274
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:15,103
What is this, a tour bus? Why would you sing?

275
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:18,007
Then should we play the "End Letter" game?!

276
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,403
Huh?

277
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:22,027
Why that? It's so childish!

278
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:26,437
Omo! That's a great idea! Ha Ni, you really thought well!

279
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:29,603
Then, let's have the topic be four character sayings!

280
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:32,037
Mi Na first!

281
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:32,087
Ee Shim Jun Shim! (tactic understanding)

282
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,037
Ee Shim Jun Shim?

283
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,803
"Shim"?

284
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,003
Ooh..."Shim Shim Pur Ee! (to kill time)

285
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,537
Is "kill time" a four character saying, Mom?

286
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:43,027
Of course! Shim Shim Pur Ee!

287
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,047
Hurry up and do it, if you don't you'll be punished!!

288
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,837
You'll have to write your name with your butt!

289
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,007
You're really immature!

290
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:49,703
One, two...

291
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,603
Ee Shil Jik Go! (telling the truth!)

292
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,017
Seung Jo.

293
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:55,303
Ah! Are you really doing this?

294
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:56,656
One, two!

295
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,603
Go...

296
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,027
"Go Jang Nan Myeong" ("It takes two to tango" or "One needs help to accomplish anything")

297
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:03,027
"GojangNanMyeong"? What does that mean?

298
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:09,237
It should just be Go Jang Nan Cha! (broken car) instead.

299
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:11,103
He didn't say "Go Jang Nan Byung" (broken disease), he said "Go Jang Nan Myeong"!

300
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:15,603
"Go Jang Nan Myeong". It means you can't make sound with just one hand!

301
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,654
Oh.

302
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,703
You're so smart!

303
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:21,077
Did you guys get that?

304
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:23,103
So stupid!

305
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,803
Yu Yu Sang Jong! (Birds of a feather flock together!)

306
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:30,503
Hey! Hurry and go. "Go Jang Nan Myeong"!

307
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,067
- One - Myeong, Myeong?

308
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,303
Two.

309
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,237
"Myeong Myeong Baek Baek!" (Crystal clear!)

310
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:38,047
Baek?

311
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:38,903
Baek.

312
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:39,915
One.

313
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:41,486
Wait a second.

314
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,087
What starts with Baek?

315
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:44,737
Baek?!

316
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:47,007
Two. Three!

317
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:59,237
"Baek Seung Jo Jjang!" (Baek Seung Jo is the best!)

318
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:03,137
You wanted to say those words so badly, that's why you asked to play this game, right?!

319
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,403
No. Are you crazy?!

320
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:24,387
Hey! It's just that there were no other words!

321
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:52,052
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

322
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:57,987
Is it ready?!

323
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:01,002
Aigoo, thank you!

324
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:05,353
Whoa! This is great!

325
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:08,453
Kids, come get some drinks!

326
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:08,092
Yes!

327
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:13,153
I should have bought Ha Ni a bikini!

328
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,052
She looks pure and pretty!

329
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:21,487
A high school girl's charm is her innocence.

330
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:30,453
- Oh.- Oh.

331
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,012
What's that, Oh Ha Ni?!

332
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:35,687
You have to use a tube?! I don't even need one.

333
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,032
Yeah, I can't swim very well.

334
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:41,687
Seung Jo, does Ha Ni look pretty? And innocent!

335
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,953
Doesn't she look like a high school student?

336
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,987
She looks like an elementary student.

337
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,953
You're pretty, Ha Ni. You're the prettiest!

338
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,387
That's right. Ha Ni is the prettiest.

339
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,487
Our Ha Ni is in bikini season.

340
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:59,453
"Best"!

341
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:03,153
I mean best.

342
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,553
I forgot.

343
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:11,387
You need these.

344
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,553
What is this!

345
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:16,653
They're socks.

346
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:22,487
Why did he give these to you?

347
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,042
<i>What is that?

348
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:37,753
They look like socks.

349
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:45,042
God, I will kill that guy today and go to hell!

350
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:52,353
HEY!!

351
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,387
Ha Ni!

352
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:55,453
Oh, Ha Ni!

353
00:21:55,453 --> 00:22:04,053
Are you okay?

354
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,787
Are you okay? Nothing happened, right?

355
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:09,987
Those socks were for you to wear.

356
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:13,082
Aren't you going to come here?

357
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:35,653
BAEK SEUNG JO!!

358
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:40,092
What is this? What's wrong with you?

359
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:44,153
Why is this suddenly being like this?!

360
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:49,887
Has it already lived its life?

361
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:52,887
We're almost there, so why are you being like this?

362
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,487
Aish!

363
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:56,953
Is it out of gas?

364
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:01,053
I don't have any money, what will I do?

365
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,087
Really!

366
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:05,412
Is there any gas?

367
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:08,587
Let's see, let's see.

368
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,887
Is it there, or is it empty?

369
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:15,653
It's too dark, I can't see anything.

370
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:19,153
Ah, that's right.

371
00:23:19,153 --> 00:23:25,062
Aish.

372
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:27,032
Oh, what's up with this?

373
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,002
This is interesting.

374
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:34,453
Here. Let's see, let's see.

375
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:37,553
Here.

376
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:44,153
Oh!

377
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:45,987
Dad, what is that?

378
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:47,287
Don't know.

379
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:48,787
Did it fall from the sky?!

380
00:23:48,787 --> 00:24:03,092
No.

381
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:05,072
I'm taking the picture!

382
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:08,072
Kimchi!

383
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,553
Is it done?!

384
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:13,072
Yeah!

385
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:16,072
Next time, we should ask someone else to take the photo.

386
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:22,487
Go Mi didn't come.

387
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:25,753
Seung Jo Oppa!

388
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:29,987
Hyung!

389
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:36,087
Oh. Well done!

390
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:49,092
Man. That dung fly, Hong Jang Mi, is getting in the way. I absolutely hate her!

391
00:24:49,092 --> 00:25:04,887
Look at that!

392
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:09,022
Kids! Let's eat some watermelon!

393
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:10,082
I think she's calling us!

394
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:13,253
Ha Ni! Come!

395
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,253
Let's go! I'm so hungry! The watermelon looks yummy!

396
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:17,453
Oh. Wait just a second!

397
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:20,082
Hey! Bbong (padding) Ha Ni!

398
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:24,153
What? Stop kidding around!

399
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,487
Bbong!

400
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:28,987
A tree goes plop and farts, "Bbong!!"

401
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,853
HEY! Really now. Baek Eun Jo!

402
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,032
<i>Bbong bboro bbong bbong, bbong bbong!

403
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,253
You really, to your Noona?!

404
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,887
<i>Bbong bboro bbong bbong, bbong bbong!</i>

405
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:39,002
What?!

406
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,082
I'll scold you!

407
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:43,653
HEY!

408
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:49,062
What's wrong with you?

409
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:51,553
Try and catch me! Just try. Come in. You can't swim, can you?!

410
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:53,653
Just try and come!

411
00:25:53,653 --> 00:26:08,053
HEY! Baek Eun Jo. Just try and come out!

412
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:11,042
Hey! Are you faking this?!

413
00:26:11,042 --> 00:26:14,987
You've got to better than that if you're just fooling around.

414
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,853
HELP ME!

415
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,012
HELP ME, PLEASE!

416
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,287
What?!

417
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,453
Is this real?!

418
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:24,062
Hey! Baek Eun Jo!

419
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:27,287
Hey! Someone fell in the water!

420
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,082
Someone help!

421
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:42,022
Dad!

422
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:46,687
After telling them to come eat watermelon, they go right back in.

423
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,072
Their maturity level is the same.

424
00:26:48,072 --> 00:27:09,053
They're just innocent!

425
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:11,787
Honey, our throats are getting dry!

426
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:13,787
Watermelon for me, too!!

427
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:17,153
I'll give you watermelon.

428
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,453
Here's some. Say "ah".

429
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:34,082
Eat some watermelon!

430
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:38,753
What?! They fell?!?!

431
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:39,092
What?!

432
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,153
Honey, what's going on?!

433
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:46,686
What?! Hey!

434
00:27:46,686 --> 00:28:07,987
Ha Ni! Ha Ni!

435
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:11,002
Just stay still!

436
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,022
Eun Jo!

437
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:15,087
Eun Jo! Are you alright?!

438
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:16,387
Are you okay?!

439
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:21,287
Eun Jo!

440
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:48,353
You're okay?! Yes?!

441
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:52,082
Our son!

442
00:28:52,082 --> 00:29:00,072
Wow! This looks so good!

443
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,953
Seung Jo.

444
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:06,002
Go give Ha Ni some water. Warm water.

445
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,053
I'll go give it to her.

446
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,082
Oh no, no!

447
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:11,353
Jang Mi, you cook the beef.

448
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:12,653
Pardon?

449
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:21,002
Baek Seung Jo, quickly!

450
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:22,076
My goodness.

451
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:26,046
Are you okay, Ha Ni?!

452
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:28,293
You don't have to go to the hospital?

453
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:30,046
No. You were scared, weren't you?

454
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:34,096
Of course!

455
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:42,393
I was so surprised, my heart is still pounding.

456
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:45,427
It had to be when I was under the sand.

457
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:48,527
It's okay. I came right out.

458
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,074
What do you mean "it's okay"?

459
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:55,793
I couldn't move because of the sand, but there you were right in front of me flailing around!

460
00:29:55,793 --> 00:30:00,191
At that moment, I was thinking...

461
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:04,016
"This is what they call hell."

462
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:16,127
I'm sorry, Dad.

463
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:24,727
Do you want some water?

464
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:32,046
Seung Jo, thank you so much. If you hadn't been there, what would have happened?

465
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,493
It was nothing.

466
00:30:35,493 --> 00:30:52,078
For that, I will pay you back with a killer dinner.

467
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:55,693
You can't swim and without fear...

468
00:30:55,693 --> 00:31:04,027
What was I supposed to do? Even when I yelled, no one could hear me.

469
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:07,793
You are an accident prone troublemaker.

470
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:13,006
I haven't had a days rest since meeting you.

471
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:16,827
Why are you being mean again?

472
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:18,493
I'm still sick.

473
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:25,427
Sick...

474
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:35,127
Who... Who are you?

475
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:40,046
Where is my Ha Ni?

476
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:41,627
Is it all ready?

477
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:43,527
Yes.

478
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,727
Then, all of the men go to the tent!

479
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,046
What about Eun Jo?

480
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:51,386
Since Eun Jo's sick, he has to sleep with me.

481
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:52,793
Yes.

482
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,727
Yes.

483
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,727
Children!

484
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,036
Wow, it's our sleeping quarters.

485
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:03,793
Wow, this is great! I get top bunk.

486
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:06,393
Wow, jackpot! So great!

487
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:07,763
I call this spot!

488
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:09,086
It really changed!

489
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:12,793
Go, go, go!

490
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:14,293
You got the top bunk.

491
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:16,127
Must be nice!

492
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:16,096
Must be nice!

493
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:18,227
You're not tired?

494
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:34,393
I'm okay.

495
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:38,046
What?

496
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:40,026
Hey, hey, you took one!

497
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:40,993
Hey!

498
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:57,593
<i>Brought to you by the Pker team @ www.viikii.net

499
00:32:57,593 --> 00:33:04,793
You know how to play guitar too?

500
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:09,076
I borrowed some of your clothes.

501
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:15,327
Okay. I heard that you saved Ha Ni.

502
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,036
I should have come a little earlier.

503
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:22,785
Well, I guess you did your fair share.

504
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:25,393
Did you come all the way here because of Oh Ha Ni?

505
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:30,527
Of course I did! I don't care what a stiff genius you are; you're still a puberty stricken 18 year old!

506
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:35,066
I don't know when you'll turn into a beast, so I've got to watch you day and night.

507
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:44,126
Why? You should just move into our house then.

508
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:52,006
Do you have an empty room?

509
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:57,036
I'm warning you! Don't you dare make a move on her!

510
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,046
Remember that I'm always watching from somewhere. Got it?

511
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:05,493
You like Oh Ha Ni that much?

512
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:13,056
Man, if you ask me that directly, it's a bit overwhelming.

513
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:16,927
Whatever I become, I need to hurry up and get a job.

514
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:21,096
My dream is to make Ha Ni happy.

515
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:27,593
Yeah. You guys look good together, you and Oh Ha Ni.

516
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:31,076
Really? You think so?

517
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:35,727
You're different than what I thought, Baek Seung Jo.

518
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:37,046
Definitely different.

519
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:40,893
Yeah, really different.

520
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:44,627
You have some taste.

521
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:48,927
Yeah. Ha Ni doesn't look good with you.

522
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:53,693
Doesn't matter how much Ha Ni likes you. That'll end in good time.

523
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:54,096
Huh.

524
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:58,086
Baek Seung Jo, should we be friends?

525
00:34:58,086 --> 00:35:00,127
No.

526
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:04,066
Why? Okay, okay. Do whatever you want.

527
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:08,036
I don't need a friend like you. As long as I have Ha Ni, I'm good.

528
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:14,993
Hey, sing a song.

529
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:20,006
<i>Once again, he has come a long way in order to protect you.

530
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:26,693
<i>Playful Kiss.

531
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:39,527
Ha Ni.

532
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:42,493
It was great when we were playing.

533
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:45,093
Seriously.

534
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:50,327
There are so many colleges, we'll get into one, right?

535
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:54,006
Of course. We still have two months left.

536
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:56,727
We can do it.

537
00:35:56,727 --> 00:36:01,046
Is this arrogance I see because you got into the top fifty within a week?

538
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:02,066
It's not that.

539
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:08,827
Ah!

540
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:15,627
You guys should be playing at this age. What kind of suffering is this? So sad.

541
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,827
It is, huh? You feel really sad for us, don't you?

542
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:21,193
We'll eat well.

543
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:23,293
Thank you very much.

544
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:26,693
Kids, if there's something you don't know,

545
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:29,193
ask him.

546
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:34,093
What else would you use a smart kid for?

547
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:35,427
Fighting.

548
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:42,527
Fighting.

549
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:46,793
Thank you.

550
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:52,076
Did you see? Her face is the size of my fist.

551
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,927
Whoa.

552
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:56,093
Ha Ni, this is no joke for you.

553
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:57,993
No. It's mother's (Seung Jo's mother) preferences.

554
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:01,193
Oh, mother?

555
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:03,793
What? It's my friend's mother.

556
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:04,086
Oh, look at this.

557
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:10,026
What is this?

558
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:11,927
"Things To Do With Seung Jo."

559
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,066
- "A date at the Nam Mountains." - Hey!

560
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,293
- "Piggyback ride amongst a lot of people." - Hey, hey!

561
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:23,076
- "Holding hands." - "Talking on the phone all night long!" "Getting married!"

562
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:27,016
It's completely decorated with Baek Seung Jo.

563
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:30,527
Give it to me!

564
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:31,627
Ha Ni!

565
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,927
Hey, what are you doing?

566
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:38,066
I thought Baek Seung Jo was really skinny,

567
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:42,393
but ever since we went on the trip, I found out he's a man.

568
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,627
Oh.

569
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:47,056
He must work out. His back muscles look really firm.

570
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,086
Hey.

571
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:51,627
Even talking about him gets you excited?!

572
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:52,493
You like him that much?

573
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:53,327
Ah, really.

574
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:54,096
Study, study!

575
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:57,493
Right.

576
00:37:57,493 --> 00:38:03,927
Number 1. 1/4 of this...

577
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,492
That's the equation.

578
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,086
The answer...

579
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:11,036
What are you talking about?

580
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:15,627
Should we start with number 2?

581
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:26,627


582
00:38:26,627 --> 00:38:28,093
What?

583
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:31,093
What?

584
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:40,093
<i>What?</i>

585
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:42,093
Hurry and go.

586
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:44,193
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

587
00:38:44,193 --> 00:39:09,271
Get up, get up.

588
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:19,038
Yes?

589
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:22,438
Eun Jo, not there, but higher.

590
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:25,604
Here?

591
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:27,404
Excuse me.

592
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,204
Do you have a bit of time?

593
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:30,371
No.

594
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:38,503
Right? Okay.

595
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,104
Hi!

596
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:43,604
What the heck, Oh Ha Ni?!

597
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:48,438
You see, I'm studying with my friends and there's a problem we don't understand.

598
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:52,838
We just can't seem to get it.

599
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:55,104
I don't want to.

600
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:58,738
Come on, it won't even take you a minute.

601
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:00,938
30 seconds, just 30 seconds!

602
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:03,873
Even 30 seconds is a waste of my time.

603
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:06,038
A waste of your time?

604
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:12,504
Our lives depend on your 30 seconds.

605
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:16,038
At least you speak well.

606
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:20,271
It's this one!

607
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:23,904
What about this do you not understand?

608
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:30,704
Huh?

00:44:15,004 --> 00:44:17,604
What are you talking about?

664
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,438
Don't you guys have any pride?!

665
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:20,438
Joon Gu!

666
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:21,338
What?!

667
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:23,504
Does pride get you into university?

668
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:25,171
What?! Pride?!

669
00:44:25,171 --> 00:44:28,271
You little! You're supposed to study on your own!

670
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:30,071
Who are you asking to teach you?!

671
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:31,071
Isn't that right?

672
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:33,771
Right, right?

673
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:38,404
Hey, you, yellow head!

674
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:40,104
You're going to go too?

675
00:44:40,104 --> 00:44:44,304
Just look at them! Fine! Go, go!

676
00:44:44,304 --> 00:44:45,871
Oh really?

677
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:46,404
Fine!

678
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:47,638
Just go, go, go!

679
00:44:47,638 --> 00:44:52,338
Hey. Hey. One. Two. Three.

680
00:44:52,338 --> 00:45:02,071
What? Man!

681
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:18,471
Why are there so many shoes?

682
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:22,971
- He's here! - Hello, Teacher!

683
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:26,504
Mom, what the heck are these--?

684
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:29,571
They all came to see you.

685
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:31,071
Baek Seung Jo!

686
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:33,038
Tutor us too.

687
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:39,071
- Me too! - Me too! - Me too!

688
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:42,704
Jeez! Oh Ha Ni.

689
00:45:42,704 --> 00:45:44,238
No way.

690
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:46,904
I'm a bit tired.

691
00:45:46,904 --> 00:45:49,804
Dear, where are you going?

692
00:45:49,804 --> 00:45:52,238
Mom is so very happy!

693
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:53,771
That my son,

694
00:45:53,771 --> 00:45:55,804
can be of help to someone like this.

695
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:59,038
You're happy?!

696
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:00,771
Hey, Oh Ha Ni!

697
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:15,504
You better come out!

698
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:16,504
Just this once?

699
00:46:16,504 --> 00:46:19,838
Oh Ha Ni, you really...

700
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,638
Save our class, just this once! I will never forget your kindness!

701
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:26,138
We'll never forget!

702
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:27,738
Please help us!

703
00:46:27,738 --> 00:46:55,204
Please save us!

704
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:56,904
The object on the ground,

705
00:46:56,904 --> 00:46:59,971
has a mass of 2 kilograms.

706
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:02,504
If 10 newtons of force are applied,

707
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:04,604
with a frictional force of 4 newtons,

708
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:10,504
what is the highest speed this object can reach?

709
00:47:10,504 --> 00:47:11,604
With this problem,

710
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:14,404
you use the equation of F = ma.

711
00:47:14,404 --> 00:47:16,471
Ahhh~

712
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:21,038
If F = ma, what is F?

713
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,204
Force.

714
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:25,304
M is mass.

715
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,471
Ah.

716
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,538
A is acceleration.

717
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:29,971
Oh, I see!

718
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:32,038
What we're looking for is the value of "a".

719
00:47:32,038 --> 00:47:34,604
Therefore A = F/M.

720
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:47,003
In this case, force is 10 newtons and mass is 2 kilograms.

721
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:48,204
Oh?

722
00:47:48,204 --> 00:47:50,004
I'll do the dishes!

723
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:51,571
I'm all done.

724
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:52,604
Your friends left?

725
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:55,138
I told you to have them over for dinner.

726
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:59,704
I couldn't. You even made lunch for all of them.

727
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:01,971
Do you think studying is going to get you anywhere?

728
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:04,104
Baek Eun Jo,

729
00:48:04,104 --> 00:48:06,171
that's a yellow card for you.

730
00:48:06,171 --> 00:48:13,338
One more time and you're out.

731
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:14,571
What should we have for dinner?

732
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:15,571
Sweet and sour pork!

733
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:18,438
No way!

734
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:24,971
It seems like Seung Jo doesn't like sweet and sour pork very much.

735
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:27,338
When we have it for lunch, he barely eats any of it.

736
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:28,538
I like it!

737
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,238
That's right.

738
00:48:30,238 --> 00:48:32,538
Seung Jo doesn't really like it.

739
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:40,771
I said that I like it!

740
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:41,604
Are you tired?

741
00:48:41,604 --> 00:48:46,038
Obviously.

742
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,204
Water?

743
00:48:48,204 --> 00:48:50,471
You want water?!

744
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:51,904
This one is cold.

745
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:53,638
Never mind.

746
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:55,971
Here.

747
00:48:55,971 --> 00:49:00,704
Oh, really!

748
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:05,871
That one was just put in.

749
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:35,871
Stop.

750
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:37,004
Hello.

751
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:41,238
Yes! What's happening?

752
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:43,238
Really?

753
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:43,971
What should I do?

754
00:49:43,971 --> 00:49:46,271
I'll leave right away!

755
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:48,638
Yes. I'm hanging up.

756
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:50,771
What should I do?

757
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,904
What am I going to do?

758
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:57,271
What should I do?

759
00:49:57,271 --> 00:50:04,871
What to do, what to do?

760
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,704
My husband is going to go straight there as well!

761
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,804
So you two figure out your own dinners, alright?

762
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:14,738
- Why isn't Hyung going?- Hyung has to study, he's a senior.

763
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:17,004
Don't come out! You two stay here!

764
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:25,838
Hey. Hurry.

765
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,871
Sorry, Ha Ni.

766
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:40,338
Bye.

767
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:48,704
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

768
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:50,471
Where are you going?

769
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:51,638
I'm going to go get food.

770
00:50:51,638 --> 00:50:54,004
I'll make it!

771
00:50:54,004 --> 00:50:56,804
As a thank you for yesterday as well as today.

772
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,304
You're going to?

773
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:00,104
What's with you?

774
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:04,738
Even though I look like this, I am Oh Gi Dong's daughter!

775
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:07,471
Always treating me like an idiot.

776
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:12,271
This time...

777
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:18,004
"Hawaiian Loco Moco"?

778
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:19,504
"On a bed of warm rice..."

779
00:51:19,504 --> 00:51:22,438
"...place a thick patty of meat."

780
00:51:22,438 --> 00:51:23,871
"Pour a generous amount..."

781
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:25,771
"...of gravy sauce."

782
00:51:25,771 --> 00:51:28,238
"Place a sunny side up fried egg on top."

783
00:51:28,238 --> 00:51:35,871
"The point is to dip the meat in the yolk."

784
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:39,338
Awesome!

785
00:51:39,338 --> 00:51:57,032
Baek Seung Jo, you're going to be absolutely amazed.

786
00:51:57,032 --> 00:52:00,729
What? The big problem was this?

787
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:02,976
Mom's good at acting, isn't she?

788
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:06,831
The bank lady called. She must be wondering what I was talking about.

789
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:10,087
You told me to come here all of a sudden, so I thought something had happened too.

790
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:12,022
But something did happen.

791
00:52:12,022 --> 00:52:15,324
Her whole class came over.

792
00:52:15,324 --> 00:52:16,092
Oh really.

793
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,946
Hey, Ha Ni is something else.

794
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:23,787
That's what I said. Ha Ni, she's got strength.

795
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:26,153
She's got bad grades. All she has is strength.

796
00:52:26,153 --> 00:52:28,753
Hey, you rascal!

797
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:39,687
Are you just going to keep saying what's true?

798
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:41,587
Oh, that picture?

799
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:46,112
We took it right in front here, when we were going to start remodeling the restaurant.

800
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:50,553
It was around the time my wife passed away so Ha Ni must have been...

801
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:55,001
...it was when she was four years old.

802
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:59,052
You're not interested in getting remarried?

803
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:04,268
Well, if someone as great as you appears.

804
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:08,887
But really, if Ha Ni gets married, you'll be lonely by yourself.

805
00:53:08,887 --> 00:53:12,254
Married?

806
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:16,991
Just hearing the word brings tears to my eyes.

807
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:18,759
There's no need for that!

808
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:21,653
We can live together!

809
00:53:21,653 --> 00:53:27,853
Huh?

810
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:31,853
Then again, I don't know if we should leave those two alone like that.

811
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:38,753
I left the two home on purpose.

812
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:41,498
The air between those two seemed so bad.

813
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:55,853
Guys and girls, if they're alone, it all works itself out naturally.

814
00:53:55,853 --> 00:54:01,486
Hey, are you going to give me food or not?

815
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:03,487
Hey, what's happening?

816
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,687
I'm sorry.

817
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:15,552
It' got slightly burned.

818
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:22,553
This burnt thing, what is it supposed to be?

819
00:54:22,553 --> 00:54:28,462
Hawaiian Loco Moco.

820
00:54:28,462 --> 00:54:34,987
Hawaiian what?

821
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:40,042
Loco Moco.

822
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:49,042
This is only slightly burned?

823
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:52,987
This isn't dinner, this is just mush.

824
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:54,387
Why?

825
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:56,052
You don't like mush?

826
00:54:56,052 --> 00:54:58,187
Hey!

827
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:15,052
Are you telling me to eat this right now?

828
00:55:15,052 --> 00:55:16,787
When do we spray this on?

829
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:18,082
Just bring the water.

830
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:29,987
Yes.

831
00:55:29,987 --> 00:55:31,687
Wow.

832
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:33,687
It's amazing.

833
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:44,853
It's just like the ones in a restaurant.

834
00:55:44,853 --> 00:55:48,087
It's really good!

835
00:55:48,087 --> 00:55:51,787
How did you cook the egg so it's so soft?

836
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:53,453
And so quickly!

837
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:54,042
It didn't even take 30 minutes.

838
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:57,002
Because I'm smart.

839
00:55:57,002 --> 00:55:58,787
Huh?

840
00:55:58,787 --> 00:56:02,042
Cooking is all smarts too.

841
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:05,753
Ah, really?

842
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:12,002
Then my dad must be super smart.

843
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:18,453
Then is Bong Joon Gu smart too?

844
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:21,553
Joon Gu is really good at cooking too.

845
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:22,387
No way.

846
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:24,587
It's true.

847
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:29,786
He sold Dduk Bokk Gi and Ma Tang for the festival and it was totally good.

848
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,053
Hey!

849
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:32,333
Is making Dduk Bokk Gi cooking?

850
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:34,487
It is. Those types of food are the hardest.

851
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:38,102
The dishes that are eaten by a lot of people, it's hard to accommodate each person's tastes.

852
00:56:38,102 --> 00:56:42,514
Even the Ma Tang, the outside was really crispy and the inside so very soft.

853
00:56:42,514 --> 00:56:48,753
You know how typically it's really mushy and sticky--

854
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,648
You're already done?

855
00:56:50,648 --> 00:56:54,753
I only had a spoonful!

856
00:56:54,753 --> 00:57:03,042
Clean it all up, and do the dishes too!

857
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:09,244
I really only had one bite.

858
00:57:09,244 --> 00:57:10,437
[So Pal Bok Noodles]

859
00:57:10,437 --> 00:57:22,426
Thank you!

860
00:57:22,426 --> 00:57:24,644
Let's go to Noraebong (karaoke)!

861
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:27,042
Noraebong?

862
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:30,253
I'm tired, let's go home.

863
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:33,269
It's only 10:00!

864
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:37,653
Let's go to Noraebong.

865
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:44,153
Noraebong?

866
00:57:44,153 --> 00:57:48,487
Oh my, seems like you're having fun.

867
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:52,353
I can't, I have an important English test.

868
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:56,807
I've got to prepare for it.

869
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:12,787
Don't worry about me and have fun.

870
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:13,887
Teddy.

871
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:32,187
Though he's always so fussy, he still does everything.

872
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:34,187
Where did my English book go?!

873
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:37,187
Why is that the only one missing?

874
00:58:37,187 --> 00:58:45,283
"Talk all night! Get married!"

875
00:58:45,283 --> 00:58:47,187
No one can see that!

876
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:52,987
It's so embarassing!

877
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,887
What will I do?

878
00:58:55,887 --> 00:59:14,687
I'm going to get made fun of so much!

879
00:59:14,687 --> 00:59:18,087
Oh, yeah! He's sleeping.

880
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:51,553
You rascal, so nice of you!

881
00:59:51,553 --> 01:00:24,787
Where is it?

882
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:37,787
He sleeps so beautifully.

883
01:00:37,787 --> 01:00:39,353
What is this?

884
01:00:39,353 --> 01:00:54,742
He only reads the original editions?

885
01:00:54,742 --> 01:00:58,653
Why are you acting like a thief?

886
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:02,453
That's not it. I had to look for something.

887
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:05,088
Do you expect me to believe that?

888
01:01:05,088 --> 01:01:10,187
Of all times, when no one was in the house but the two of us,

889
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:11,052
you suddenly have something to look for?

890
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:14,453
What?

891
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:20,353
No. Really.

892
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,004
Bong Joon Gu said...

893
01:01:22,004 --> 01:01:26,587
...that we're all puberty stricken 18 year olds.

894
01:01:26,587 --> 01:01:28,353
Why are you acting like this?

895
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:30,147
What do you mean "why are you acting like this"?

896
01:01:30,147 --> 01:01:32,753
Isn't this why you came in here?

897
01:01:32,753 --> 01:01:33,794
What?

898
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:35,853
No way!

899
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:37,945
What's it matter?

900
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:44,072
We're the only ones in the house right now.

901
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:48,453
Seung Jo, why are you acting like this?

902
01:01:48,453 --> 01:01:54,082
Seung Jo ssi!

903
01:01:54,082 --> 01:02:13,481
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

904
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:15,853
What major?

905
01:02:15,853 --> 01:02:17,087
Why would you go to university?

906
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:21,787
When you find something you like, your heart starts to beat fast.

907
01:02:21,787 --> 01:02:24,022
What's going on?

908
01:02:24,022 --> 01:02:25,491
Shut up!

909
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,453
I knew we would be far apart.

910
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:28,012
Hello?

911
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:31,046
Yes, yes, yes, I will go!

912
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:34,959
I'll be there! Thank you!

913
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,253
Where are you?

914
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:40,953
Ha Ni, why don't you go in first for now?

915
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:41,468
You got it!

916
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:42,187
You got it!

917
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:44,433
Seung Jo got it for me.

918
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:48,287
Do you think I won this so I could play with it?

919
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:52,613
If you come to my university, I could keep you entertained.

920
01:02:52,613 --> 01:02:55,553
You're going to take the exam tomorrow, right?

921
01:02:55,553 --> 01:02:57,079
Did you catch a cold?

922
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:59,687
This won't make me drowsy, right?

923
01:02:59,687 --> 01:03:02,487
I hear you fed Seung Jo Oppa sleeping pills.

924
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,087
Please tell me it's not like that.

925
01:03:05,087 --> 99:59:59,999
That nothing happened.

1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,680
We're told to find the x- and
y-intercepts for the graph of

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,030
this equation: 2 y plus
1/3x is equal to 12.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,400
And just as a bit of a
refresher, the x-intercept is

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,240
the point on the graph that
intersects the x-axis.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,110
So we're not above or below
the x-axis, so our y value

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,910
must be equal to 0.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,330
And by the exact same argument,
the y-intercept

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,290
occurs when we're not to the
right or the left of the

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,070
y-axis, so that's when
x is equal to 0.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,580
So let's set each of these
values to 0 and then solve for

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,340
what the other one has
to be at that point.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,080
So for the x-intercept,
when y is equal to

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,400
0, let's solve this.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,720
So we get 2 times 0, plus
1/3x is equal to 12.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,530
I just set y is equal to
0 right there, right?

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,800
I put 0 for y.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,870
Well, anything times 0 is just
0, so you're just left with

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,760
1/3x is equal to 12.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,120
To solve for x, you can think of
it as either dividing both

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,410
sides by 1/3, or we can multiply
both sides by the

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,020
reciprocal of 1/3.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,720
And the reciprocal of 1/3 is 3,
or you can even think of it

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,185
as 3 over 1.

24
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,890
So times 3 over 1.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,250
And so we're left with 3 times
1/3, that just cancels out, so

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,690
you're left with x is equal
to 12 times 3, or

27
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,550
x is equal to 36.

28
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,340
So when y is equal
to 0, x is 36.

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,520
So the point 36 comma 0 is on
the graph of this equation.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,360
And this is also the
x-intercept.

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
Now, let's do the same thing
for the y-intercept.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:55,060
So let's set x equal 0, so you
get 2y plus 1/3, times 0 is

33
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,320
equal to 12.

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
Once again, anything
times 0 is 0.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,470
So that's 0, and you're just
left with 2y is equal to 12.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,009
Divide both sides by 2 to solve
for y, and you're left

37
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,640
with y is equal to
12 over 2, is 6.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,636
So the y-intercept is when
x is equal to 0 and

39
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,650
y is equal to 6.

40
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,770
So let's plot these
two points.

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,780
I'll just do a little hand-drawn
graph, and make it

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,180
clear what the x- and the
y-intercepts are.

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,150
So let me draw-- that's my
vertical axis, and that is my

44
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,630
horizontal axis-- and we have
the point 36 comma 0.

45
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,660
So this is the origin right
here, that's the x-axis,

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,670
that's the y-axis.

47
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,750
The point 36 comma 0 might
be all the way over here.

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,270
So that's the point
36 comma 0.

49
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:54,460
And if that's 36, then the
point 0, 6 might be right

50
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,210
about there.

51
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,940
So that's the point 0, 6.

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,390
And the line will look
something like this.

53
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,810
I'm trying my best to draw
a straight line.

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,360
And notice where the line
intercepted or intersected the

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,330
y-axis, that's the y-intercept,
x is 0, because

56
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,190
we're not to the right
or the left of it.

57
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,750
Where the line intersected the
x-axis, y is 0, because we're

58
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,300
not above or below it.

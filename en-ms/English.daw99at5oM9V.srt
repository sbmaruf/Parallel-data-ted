1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I have here a bunch of radical
expressions, or square root

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,110
expressions.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,600
And what I'm going to do is
go through all of them and

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,500
simplify them.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,240
And we'll talk about whether
these are rational or

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,390
irrational numbers.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,710
So let's start with A.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,440
A is equal to the square
root of 25.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,560
Well that's the same thing as
the square root of 5 times 5,

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,000
which is a clearly
going to be 5.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,440
We're focusing on the positive
square root here.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,060
Now let's do B.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,920
B I'll do in a different color,
for the principal root,

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,250
when we say positive
square root.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,200
B, we have the square
root of 24.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,960
So what you want to do, is
you want to get the prime

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,530
factorization of this
number right here.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,560
So 24, let's do its prime
factorization.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,250
This is 2 times 12.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,720
12 is 2 times 6.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,430
6 is 2 times 3.

22
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,220
So the square root of 24, this
is the same thing as the

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:15,320
square root of 2 times
2 times 2 times 3.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,080
That's the same thing as 24.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,530
Well, we see here, we have one
perfect square right there.

26
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,870
So we could rewrite this.

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,330
This is the same thing as the
square root of 2 times 2 times

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,030
the square root of 2 times 3.

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,890
Now this is clearly 2.

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,010
This is the square root of 4.

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,920
The square root of 4 is 2.

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,710
And then this we can't
simplify anymore.

33
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,520
We don't see two numbers
multiplied by itself here.

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,940
So this is going to be times
the square root of 6.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,110
Or we could even right this as
the square root of 2 times the

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,540
square root of 3.

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,210
Now I said I would talk
about whether things

38
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,550
are rational or not.

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,460
This is rational.

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,630
This part A can be expressed
as the ratio of 2 integers.

41
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,920
Namely 5/1.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,340
This is rational.

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,590
This is irrational.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,060
I'm not going to prove
it in this video.

45
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,770
But anything that is the product
of irrational numbers.

46
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:24,920
And the square root of any prime
number is irrational.

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,790
I'm not proving it here.

48
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,060
This is the square root of 2
times the square root of 3.

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,365
That's what the square
root of 6 is.

50
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:32,280
And that's what makes
this irrational.

51
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,910
I cannot express this as
any type of fraction.

52
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,830
I can't express this as some
integer over some other

53
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,280
integer like I did there.

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,250
And I'm not proving it here.

55
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,910
I'm just giving you a little
bit of practice.

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,010
And a quicker way to do this.

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,300
You could say, hey,
4 goes into this.

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,770
4 is a perfect square.

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,830
Let me take a 4 out.

60
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,120
This is 4 times 6.

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,770
The square root of 4 is 2, leave
the 6 in, and you would

62
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,160
have gotten the 2 square
roots of 6.

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,990
Which you will get the hang of
it eventually, but I want to

64
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,590
do it systematically first.

65
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,820
Let's do part C.

66
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,610
Square root of 20.

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,350
Once again, 20 is 2 times
10, which is 2 times 5.

68
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,050
So this is the same thing as the
square root of 2 times 2,

69
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,740
right, times 5.

70
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,690
Now, the square root of 2 times
2, that's clearly just

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,120
going to be 2.

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,530
It's going to be the square
root of this times

73
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,380
square root of that.

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,400
2 times the square root of 5.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,090
And once again, you could
probably do that in your head

76
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,910
with a little practice.

77
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,920
The square root of the
20 is 4 times 5.

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,550
The square root of 4 is 2.

79
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,080
You leave the 5 in
the radical.

80
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,200
So let's do part D.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,380
We have to do the square
root of 200.

82
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,350
Same process.

83
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,390
Let's take the prime
factors of it.

84
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,310
So it's 2 times 100, which is
2 times 50, which is 2 times

85
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,030
25, which is 5 times 5.

86
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,640
So this right here,
we can rewrite it.

87
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,800
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit.

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:15,030
This is equal to the square
root of 2 times 2 times 2

89
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,390
times 5 times 5.

90
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,730
Well we have one perfect square
there, and we have

91
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,350
another perfect square there.

92
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,290
So if I just want to write out
all the steps, this would be

93
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,170
the square root of 2 times 2
times the square root of 2

94
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,120
times the square root
of 5 times 5.

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,345
The square root of
2 times 2 is 2.

96
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,245
The square root of 2 is just
the square root of 2.

97
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:43,680
The square root of 5 times 5,
that's the square root of 25,

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,430
that's just going to be 5.

99
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,880
So you can rearrange these.

100
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,830
2 times 5 is 10.

101
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,730
10 square roots of 2.

102
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,150
And once again, this
it is irrational.

103
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,800
You can't express it as a
fraction with an integer and a

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,850
numerator and the denominator.

105
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,270
And if you were to actually try
to express this number, it

106
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,610
will just keep going on and on
and on, and never repeating.

107
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,790
Well let's do part E.

108
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,720
The square root of 2000.

109
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,660
I'll do it down here.

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,620
Part E, the square
root of 2000.

111
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,950
Same exact process that we've
been doing so far.

112
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,820
Let's do the prime
factorization.

113
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:35,680
That is 2 times 1000, which is
2 times 500, which is 2 times

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:45,930
250, which is 2 times 125,
which is 5 times 25,

115
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,580
which is 5 times 5.

116
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,600
And we're done.

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,180
So this is going to be equal to
the square root of 2 times

118
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,630
2-- I'll put it in parentheses--
2 times 2, times

119
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,350
2 times 2, times 2 times
2, times 5 times 5,

120
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,840
times 5 times 5, right?

121
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,390
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 2's, and
then 3, 5's, times 5.

122
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,000
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,520
Well, one thing you might see
is, hey, I could write this

124
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,140
as, this is a 4, this is a 4.

125
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,510
So we're going to have
a 4 repeated.

126
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,600
And so this the same thing as
the square root of 4 times 4

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,330
times the square root of
5 times 5 times the

128
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,480
square root of 5.

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,310
So this right here
is obviously 4.

130
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,570
This right here is 5.

131
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,070
And then times the
square root of 5.

132
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,070
So 4 times 5 is 20 square
roots of 5.

133
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,290
And once again, this
is irrational.

134
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,990
Well, let's do F.

135
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:16,850
The square root of 1/4, which
we can view this is the same

136
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,250
thing as the square root of 1
over the square root of 4,

137
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,180
which is equal to 1/2.

138
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,170
Which is clearly rational.

139
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,400
It can be expressed
as a fraction.

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,050
So that's clearly rational.

141
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:39,380
Part G is the square
root of 9/4.

142
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Same logic.

143
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,160
This is equal to the square root
of 9 over the square root

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,910
of 4, which is equal to 3/2.

145
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,960
Let's do part H.

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,720
The square root of 0.16.

147
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,250
Now you could do this in your
head if you immediately

148
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,670
recognize that, gee, if
I multiply 0.4 times

149
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,170
0.4, I'll get this.

150
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,190
But I'll show you a more
systematic way of doing it, if

151
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,040
that wasn't obvious to you.

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,330
So this is the same thing
as the square

153
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,730
root of 16/100, right?

154
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,840
That's what 0.16 is.

155
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,740
So this is equal to the square
root of 16 over the square

156
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:37,010
root of 100, which is equal to
4/10, which is equal to 0.4.

157
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,260
Let's do a couple
more like that.

158
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,429
OK.

159
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:46,180
Part I was the square root of
0.1, which is equal to the

160
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,840
square root of 1/10, which is
equal to the square root of 1

161
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,980
over the square root of 10,
which is equal to 1 over--

162
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,890
now, the square root of 10--
10 is just 2 times 5.

163
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,380
So that doesn't really
help us much.

164
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,920
So that's just the square
root of 10 like that.

165
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,130
A lot of math teachers don't
like you leaving that radical

166
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,870
in the denominator.

167
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,330
But I can already tell you
that this is irrational.

168
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,650
You'll just keep getting
numbers.

169
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,850
You can try it on your
calculator, and

170
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,530
it will never repeat.

171
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,430
Your calculator will just give
you an approximation.

172
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,100
Because in order to give the
exact value, you'd have to

173
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,560
have an infinite number
of digits.

174
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,770
But if you wanted to
rationalize this,

175
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,820
just to show you.

176
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,620
If you want to get rid of the
radical in the denominator,

177
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,090
you can multiply this times the
square root of 10 over the

178
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,520
square root of 10, right?

179
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,910
This is just 1.

180
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,130
So you get the square
root of 10/10.

181
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,630
These are equivalent statements,
but both of them

182
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,540
are irrational.

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,870
You take an irrational number,
divide it by 10, you still

184
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,660
have an irrational number.

185
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,930
Let's do J.

186
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,820
We have the square
root of 0.01.

187
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,570
This is the same thing as the
square root of 1/100.

188
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,680
Which is equal to the square
root of 1 over the square root

189
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,050
of 100, which is equal
to 1/10, or 0.1.

190
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,030
Clearly once again
this is rational.

191
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,880
It's being written
as a fraction.

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,185
This one up here was
also rational.

193
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:16,030
It can be written expressed
as a fraction.

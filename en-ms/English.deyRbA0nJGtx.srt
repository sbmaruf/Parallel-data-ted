1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110


2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,020
In this presentation we're
going to learn how to graph

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,160
trig functions without
having to kind of

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,970
graph point by point.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,410
And hopefully after this
presentation you can also look

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,120
at a trig function and be able
to figure out the actual

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,740
analytic definition of
the function as well.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,440
So let's start.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,720
Let's say f of x.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,550
Let me make sure I'm using
all the right tools.

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:45,200
So let's say that f of x is
equal to 2 sine of 1/2 x.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,890
So when we look at this, a
couple interesting things here.

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,980
How is this different than just
the regular sine function?

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,170
Well, here we're multiplying
the whole function by 2,

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,780
and also the coefficient
on the x-term is 1/2.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,650
And if you've seen some of the
videos I've made, you'll know

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,010
that this term affects the
amplitude and this term affects

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,070
the period, or the inverse of
the period, which

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,730
is the frequency.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,130
Either way.

21
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,440
It depends whether you're
talking about one or the

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,750
inverse of the other one.

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,710
So let's start with
the amplitude.

24
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,670
This 2 tells us that the
amplitude of this function

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,890
is going to be 2.

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,320
Because if it was just a 1
there the amplitude would be 1.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
So it's going to
be 2 times that.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,500
So let's draw a little dotted
line up here at y equals 2.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,230
And then another dotted line
at y equals negative 2.

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:45,780


31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,740
So we know this is
the amplitude.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,650
We know that the function is
going to somehow oscillate

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,710
between these two points, but
we have to figure out how fast

34
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,570
is it going to oscillate
between the two points,

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,800
or what's its period.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,330
And I'll give you a
little formula here.

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,060


38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,390
The function is equal to the
amplitude times, let's say,

39
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,890
sine, but it would also
work with cosine.

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:16,030
The amplitude of the function
times sine of 2pi divided

41
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,800
by the period of the
function, times x.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,850
This right here is a "p."

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,340
So it might not be completely
obvious where this comes from.

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,260
But what I want you to do is
maybe after this video or

45
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,950
maybe in future videos we'll
experiment when we see what

46
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,770
happens when we change this
coefficient on the x-term.

47
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,520
And I think it'll start
to make sense to you why

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,910
this equation holds.

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,190
But let's just take this as
kind of an act of faith right

50
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,140
now, that 2pi divided by the
period is the coefficient on x.

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,670
So if we say that 2pi divided
by the period is equal to the

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,100
coefficient, which is 1/2.

53
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,440
I know this is extremely messy.

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
And this is separate from this.

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
So 2pi divided by the
period is equal to 1/2.

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,150
Or we could say 1/2 the
period is equal to 2pi.

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,700
Or, the period is equal to 4pi.

58
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,110
So we know the amplitude
is equal to 2 and the

59
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,750
period is equal to 4pi.

60
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,610
And once again, how did
we figure out that the

61
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,050
period is equal to 4pi?

62
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,670
We used this formula: 2pi
divided by the period is the

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,590
coefficient on the x-term.

64
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,020
So we set 2pi divided by the
period equal to 1/2, and then

65
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,620
we solved that the
period is 4pi.

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,650
So where do we start?

67
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,580
Well, what is f of 0?

68
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,330
Well, when x is equal to
0 this whole term is 0.

69
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,210
So what's sine of 0?

70
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,650
Sine of 0 is 0,
if you remember.

71
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,870
I guess you could use a
calculator, but that's

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,320
something you should remember.

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,900
Or you could re-look at the
unit circle to remind yourself.

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,990
Sine of 0 is 0.

75
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,140
And then 0 times 2 is 0.

76
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,640
So f of 0 is 0.

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,920
Right?

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,510
We'll draw it right there.

79
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,290
And we know that it
has a period of 4pi.

80
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,300
That means that the function
is going to repeat after 4pi.

81
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,166
So if we go out it should
repeat back out here, at 4pi.

82
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,020


83
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,930
And now we can just kind
of draw the function.

84
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,594
And this will take a little bit
of practice, but-- actually I'm

85
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:25,780
going to draw it, and then we
can explore it a little

86
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,490
bit more as well.

87
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,515
So the function's going
to look like this.

88
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:33,260


89
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,750
Oh, boy.

90
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,280
This is more difficult
than I thought.

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,350
And it'll keep going in
this direction as well.

92
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,920


93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:51,980
And notice, the period here you
could do it from here to here.

94
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,170
This distance is 4pi.

95
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,490
That's how long it takes for
the function to repeat, or

96
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,800
to go through one cycle.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,840
Or you could also, if you
want, you could measure this

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
distance to this distance.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,230
This would also be 4pi.

100
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,860
And that's the period
of the function.

101
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,270
And then, of course, the
amplitude of the function,

102
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,590
which is this right here, is 2.

103
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,140
Here's the amplitude.

104
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,590
And then the period of 4pi we
figured out from this equation.

105
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,100
Another way we could have
thought about it, let's say

106
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,710
that-- let me erase some of the
stuff-- let's say I didn't

107
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,940
have this stuff right here.

108
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,950
Let's say I didn't know
what the function was.

109
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,090
Let me get rid of
all of this stuff.

110
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,360
And all I saw was this
graph, and I asked you

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,990
to go the other way.

112
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,440
Using this graph, try to figure
out what the function is.

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,910
Then we would just see,
how long does it take for

114
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,750
the function to repeat?

115
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,140
Well, it takes 4pi radians for
the function to repeat, so

116
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,960
you'd be able to just visually
realize that the period

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,620
of this function is 4pi.

118
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,980
And then you would say,
well what's the amplitude?

119
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,180
The amplitude is easy.

120
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,320
You would just see how
high it goes up or down.

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,170
And it goes up 2, right?

122
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,030
When you're doing the amplitude
you don't do the whole swing,

123
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,120
you just do how much it
swings in the positive

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
or negative direction.

125
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,840
So the amplitude is 2.

126
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm using the wrong color.

127
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,350
The period is 4pi.

128
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,930


129
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,430
And then your question
would be, well this is

130
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,600
an oscillating, this is
a periodic function.

131
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,080
Is it a sine or is it
a cosine function?

132
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,610
Well, cosine function, assuming
we're not doing any shifting--

133
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,070
and in a future module I will
shift along the x-axis-- but

134
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,320
assuming we're not doing any
shifting, cosine of 0 is 1.

135
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,500
Right?

136
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,270
And sine of 0 is 0.

137
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,900
And what's this function at 0?

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,970
Well, it's 0.

139
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,370
Right?

140
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,670
So this is going to
be a sine function.

141
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,290
So we would use
this formula here.

142
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,120
f of x is equal to the
amplitude times the sine of 2pi

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,190
divided by the period times x.

144
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,780
So we would know that the
function is f of x is equal to

145
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:19,690
the amplitude times sine of 2pi
over the period-- 4pi-- x.

146
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,135
And, of course,
these cancel out.

147
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:26,900
And then this cancels out and
becomes 2 sine of 1/2 x.

148
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,070
I know this is a little
difficult to read.

149
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,020
My apologies.

150
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,960
And I'll ask a question.

151
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,720
What would this
function look like?

152
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:45,170
f of x equals 2
cosine of 1/2 x.

153
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,530
Well, it's going to look the
same but we're going to

154
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,930
start at a different point.

155
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,430
What's cosine of 0?

156
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,430
When x is equal to 0 this
whole term is equal to 0.

157
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,550
Cosine of 0, we
learned before, is 1.

158
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,500
So f of 0 is equal to 2.

159
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,470
Let me write that. f
of 0 is equal to 2.

160
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,600
Let me do this in a
different color.

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,530
Let me draw the cosine function
in a different color.

162
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,560
We would start here.

163
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,270
f of 0 is equal to 2, but
everything else is the same.

164
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,670
The amplitude is the same
and the period is the same.

165
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,110
So now it's going
to look like this.

166
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,600
I hope I don't mess this up.

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,190
This is difficult.

168
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,986
So now the function is
going to look like this.

169
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:30,090
And you're going to go down
here, and you're going

170
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,030
to rise up again here.

171
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,580
And on this side you're
going to do the same thing.

172
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,210
And keep going.

173
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,510
So notice, the cosine
and the sine functions

174
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,120
look awfully similar.

175
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,780
And the way to differentiate
them is what they do-- well,

176
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,570
what they do in general.

177
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,020
But the easiest way is, what
happens when you input

178
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,420
a 0 into the function?

179
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,260
What happens at the y-axis, or
when x is equal to 0, or when

180
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,040
the angle that you input
into it is equal 0?

181
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,270
Unless we're doing shifting--
and don't worry about shifting

182
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,610
for now, I'll do that in future
modules-- sine of 0 is 0

183
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,910
while cosine of 0 would be 1.

184
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,920
And since we're multiplying it
times this factor right here,

185
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,120
times this number right
here, the 1 becomes a 2.

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,900
And so this is the
graph of cosine of x.

187
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,750
This is this graph
of sine of x.

188
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,600
And this is a little bit of
a preview for shifting.

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,760
Notice that the pink graph,
or cosine of x, is very

190
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,210
similar to the green graph.

191
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:33,590
And it's just shifted this
way by-- well, in this

192
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,120
case it's shifted by pi.

193
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,870
Right?

194
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,790
And this actually has something
to do with the period

195
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,770
of the coefficient.

196
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,450
In general, cosine of x is
actually sine of x shifted

197
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,810
to the left by pi/2.

198
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,050
But I don't want to
confuse you too much.

199
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,170
That's all the time I
have for this video.

200
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,070
I will now do another video
with a couple of more

201
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,030
examples like this.

202
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,000

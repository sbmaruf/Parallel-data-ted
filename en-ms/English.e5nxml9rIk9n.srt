1
00:00:01,277 --> 00:00:11,387
Evaluate 0 plus y plus -7 when y is equal to -3 and y is equal to 0 and y is equal to 7.

2
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:17,652
So let's take the first situation where y is equal to -3...

3
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:31,807
Then this expression right here would be... 0 plus -3 (because that's our "y" now) plus -7.

4
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:36,645
Now 0 plus or minus anything won't change its value

5
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,377
So you can really just ignore the 0 here.

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:50,995
This is going to be the same thing, this is going to be the exact same thing, as -3 plus -7.

7
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:55,632
-3 plus -7

8
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:58,831
Now we could draw a number line here, just to help us visualize it

9
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:02,087
But even if we didn't have the number line, we could say "Look, we're already 3 below zero...

10
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:06,874
We're going to go another 7 to the left... another 7 more negative."

11
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:11,003
So we're 3 away from zero, we're going to go 7 more away from zero

12
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,747
So we're going to be 10 to the left of zero, or -10.

13
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,389
Or another way to think of it...

14
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:18,729
Lemme draw the number line there (always better to have the visual).

15
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:21,266
So we're starting (this is zero)

16
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,240
We're starting at -3, and to that we're adding -7

17
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,679
So we're starting at -3, the absolute value is -3[sic]

18
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:33,465
is our starting point. To that we're adding another negative 7

19
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,230
We're going to move another 7 to the left.

20
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:40,446
So we're adding (let me draw this)... we're adding a negative 7 right over here

21
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,077
We're adding a negative 7 right over here

22
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,671
So what's the length of this over here?

23
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:50,402
The absolute value of -7 is equal to 7... that's the length of this arrow.

24
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:53,457
But we're moving it to the left. The abolsute value of this

25
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:59,701
arrow right here (the absolute value of negative 3) is 3.

26
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:03,809
So we're already 3 to the left, now we're moving 7 more to left

27
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:06,809
So now we're going to be 10 to the left.

28
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:09,734
We are going to be 10 to left.

29
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,470
10 to the left.

30
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,630
This is literally, this is equal to the absolute value of -7...

31
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,755
Let me do it in the order that we wrote it in the problem...

32
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,399
So this is equal to the absolute value of -3 (you'd want to use the same colors)

33
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:37,552
The absolute value of -3 plus the absolute value of -7.

34
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:44,327
But we're to the left of zero (we've been moving to the left) so it's the &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt; of that

35
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:46,948
which is -10

36
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,621
So if your signs are the same, you can just take the absolute value of them

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,490
say "ok, that's how far we're going to move, total. and we're that far from zero to the left"

38
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,960
So the answer here is -10

39
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:01,346
That was when y is -3.

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,248
Let's think about when y is equal to 0.

41
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:14,000
When y is equal to 0, this expression up here becomes 0 plus 0 (our y here is going to be zero)...

42
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,283
(We'll do it in that same blue color.)

43
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:22,528
.... plus 0 plus -7.

44
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:26,034
Now, if you add 0 to anything it's not going to change the value.

45
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:30,691
So this thing over here, this is pretty straight-forward, these don't matter

46
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,650
It's just going to be equal to -7

47
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:37,049
Now let's do the last one (when y is equal to 7)

48
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:49,644
It's going to be 0 plus (our y is equal to 7) so 0 plus 7 and then we have plus -7

49
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,645
Now there's a couple of ways to do this...

50
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:57,212
You could literally just say "now adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting the number".

51
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:01,905
You could say this is equivalent to 0 plus 7 minus 7

52
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:05,185
Plus -7 is the same thing as subtracting a 7

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,290
The zero doesn't matter, so this is equal to 7 minus 7... which is equal to zero!

54
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,168
Another way to think about it...

55
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,329
Let's draw a number line

56
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,365
So let's say that this is zero

57
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:27,378
We're starting off at 7. We're 7 to the right of zero.

58
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:32,568
And to that we're adding a -7.

59
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,554
So we're going to move 7 to the left of where we were.

60
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,620
7 to the left of 7 which was 7 to the right of 0!

61
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:43,369
This gets us back to 0.

62
00:04:43,400 --> 100:00:00,000
So the answer is... zero.

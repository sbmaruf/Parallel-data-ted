1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,475
We're asked to subtract.

3
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:04,900
And we have the
problem 68 minus 42.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,790
And what I want
to do here is one,

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,050
just show you how I
would do this problem,

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,520
and then talk a little bit
about why it actually works.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,800
So if I have 68 minus
42, one way to do it--

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,670
and this is probably
the most typical way--

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,690
is to write the number you're
subtracting from on top,

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,650
and write the number that you're
subtracting from that number

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,410
below that.

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,200
So we're going to
have 68 minus 42.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,050
And the thing you really
want to make sure you do

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,340
is that you want to align
it according to place.

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,930
So the 2 is below the 8.

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,610
They're both in the ones place.

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,085
And the 4 is below the 6.

18
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:38,526
They're both in the tens place.

19
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:40,400
And later in this video,
it should be clear--

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
or I'll hopefully
make it clear--

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,700
why that's a good thing to do.

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,460
So then we go to the ones
place, and we see an 8.

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,630
And from that, we're
going to subtract a 2.

24
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,217
So 8 minus 2 is 6.

25
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,300
I'll write that over here.

26
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,880
Let me write that over here.

27
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,920
8 minus 2 is 6.

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,180
8 minus 2 is equal to 6.

29
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,120

30
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,505
And then we go to
the tens place.

31
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,177
We have 6 minus 4.

32
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:06,760
And since they're
[? in ?] tens place,

33
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,580
this is really 60 minus 40.

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,520
But 6 minus 4 is 2.

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,437
6 minus 4 is equal to 2.

36
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,020
And since these are
in the tens place,

37
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,424
this is really saying 60
minus 40 is equal to 20.

38
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:21,590
And I'll make that a little
bit clearer in a second.

39
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,810
So we're actually done here.

40
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,411
68 minus 42 is equal to 26.

41
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,910
And you can check
that for yourself.

42
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,510
If you add 26 plus
42, you should get 68.

43
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,960
Or if you subtract 26 from
68, you should get 42.

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,270
So I encourage you do that in
your own time after this video.

45
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,272
Verify that 42 plus
26 is equal to 68.

46
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,900
And also verify what 68
minus 26 is equal to.

47
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,880
And you should see
that it is equal to 42.

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,134
So these are two things for
you to check on your own.

49
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,050
Now, the last thing I
want to do in this video

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,190
is just to explain in
a little bit more depth

51
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,800
why this actually works.

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,272
And at least in my mind,
I like to visualize 68.

53
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,980
You won't have to
write it out like this,

54
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,240
but it's one way to
make sure you really

55
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,573
understand what's going on here.

56
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:15,440
68 is the same thing as
60 plus 8, or 60 and 8.

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,600
And from that, we're
subtracting 42.

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,070
But 42 is the same
thing as 40 plus 2.

59
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,760
So we're subtracting 40,
and we're subtracting 2.

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,980
We're subtracting 42.

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,370
We're subtracting 40 and 2.

62
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,780
And so you could view this as
really two separate problems.

63
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,072
In the ones place,
you have an 8 minus 2.

64
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,905
And that's is exactly
what we did over here.

65
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,240
You have a 6.

66
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,460
And then in the tens place,
you have a 60 minus 40,

67
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,270
which is 20.

68
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,810
So you end up with 20 plus 6.

69
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,840
And you know that that's
the same exact thing as 26.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,359

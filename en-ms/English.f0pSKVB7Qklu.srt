1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How beautiful, is this worldly life

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But not a soul shall remain

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We've all come into this world

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Only to leave it one day

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can see that everything around me

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Rises then fades away

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Life is just a passing moment

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nothing is meant to stay, oh

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This worldly life has an end

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And it's then real life begins

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A world where we will live forever

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This beautiful worldly life has an end

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's just a bridge that must be crossed

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
To a life that will go on forever

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So many years, quickly slipping by

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Like the Sleepers of the Cave

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wake up and make a choice

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Before we end up in our graves

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
O God! You didn't put me here in vain

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know I'll be held accountable for what I do

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This life is just a journey

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And it's taking me back to You

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This worldly life has an end

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And it's then real life begins

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A world where we will live forever

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This beautiful worldly life has an end

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's just a bridge that must be crossed

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
To a life that will go on forever

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So many get caught in this beautiful web

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Its gardens become an infatuation

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But surely they'll understand at the final stop

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That its gardens are meant for cultivation, oh

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This worldly life has an end

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And it's then real life begins

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A world where we will live forever

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This beautiful worldly life has an end

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's just a bridge that must be crossed

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To a life that will go on forever

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This worldly life has an end

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's then real life begins

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A world where we will live forever

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This beautiful worldly life has an end

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's just a bridge that must be crossed

44
00:03:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
To a life that will go on forever

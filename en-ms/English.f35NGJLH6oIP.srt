1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,730
I think you're probably
reasonably familiar with the

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,790
idea of a square root, but I
want to clarify some of the

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,250
notation that at least, I always
found a little bit

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,000
ambiguous at first. I
want to make it very

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,100
clear in your head.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,680
If I write a 9 under a radical
sign, I think you know you'll

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,940
read this as the square
root of 9.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,880
But I want to make one
clarification.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,990
When you just see a number
under a radical sign like

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:38,650
this, this means the principal
square root of 9.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,420
And when I say the principal
square root, I'm really saying

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,300
the positive square root of 9.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,770
So this statement right
here is equal to 3.

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,350
And I'm being clear here because
you might already know

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,390
that 9 has two actual
square roots.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,000
By definition, a square root is
something-- A square root

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,190
of 9 is a number that, if
you square it, equals 9.

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,830
3 is a square root, but
so is negative 3.

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,260
Negative 3 is also
a square root.

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,310
But if you just write a radical
sign, you're actually

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,990
referring to the positive square
root, or the principal

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,650
square root.

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,710
If you want to refer to the
negative square root, you'd

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,520
actually put a negative in front
of the radical sign.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,170
That is equal to negative 3.

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,970
Or if you wanted to refer to
both the positive and the

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,520
negative, both the principal and
the negative square roots,

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,450
you'll write a plus or
a minus sign in front

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,220
of the radical sign.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,650
And of course, that's equal to
plus or minus 3 right there.

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,450
So with that out of the way,
what I want to talk about is

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,280
the graph of the function, y
is equal to the principal

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,520
square root of x.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,765
And see how it relates to the
function y is equal to x-- Let

35
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,740
me write it over here because
I'll work on it.

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,960
See how it relates to y
is equal to x squared.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,090
And then, if we have some time,
we'll shift them around

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,940
a little bit and get a better
understanding of what causes

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,400
these functions to shift up
down or left and right.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,590
So let's make a little value
table before we get out our

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,490
graphing calculator.

42
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,180
So this is for y is equal
to x squared.

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,720
So we have x and y values.

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,870
This is y is equal to the
square root of x.

45
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,780
Once again, we have x and
y values right there.

46
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,790
So let me just pick some
arbitrary x values right here,

47
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,380
and I'll stay in the
positive x domain.

48
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,300
So let's say x is equal
to 0, 1-- Let me

49
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,900
make it color coded.

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,590
When x is equal to 0, what's
y going to be equal to?

51
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,090
Well y is x squared.

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,250
0 squared is 0.

53
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,750
When x is 1, y is 1 squared,
which is 1.

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,710
When x is 2, y is 2 squared,
which is 4.

55
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,510
When x is 3, y is 3 squared,
which is 9.

56
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,240
We've seen this before.

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,100
And I could keep going.

58
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,340
Let me add 4 here.

59
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,640
So when x is 4, y is
4 squared, or 16.

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,430
We've seen all of this.

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,000
We've graphed our parabolas.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
This is all a bit of review.

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,800
Now let's see what happens
when y is equal to the

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,300
principal square root of x.

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,650
Let's see what happens.

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,360
And I'm going to pick some x
values on purpose just to make

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
it interesting.

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,790
When x is equal to 0, what's
y going to be equal to?

69
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,220
The principal square
root of 0?

70
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,550
Well it's 0.

71
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,410
0 squared is 0.

72
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,280
When x is equal to 1, the
principal square root of x of

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,110
1 is just positive 1.

74
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,050
It has another square root
that's negative 1, but we

75
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,000
don't have a positive or
negative written here.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We just have the principal
square root.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,500
When x is a 4, what is y?

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,340
Well, the principal square
root of 4 is positive 2.

79
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,430
When x is equal to
9, what's y?

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,630
When x is equal to 9,
the principal square

81
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,980
root of 9 is 3.

82
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,950
Finally, when x is equal to 16,
the principal square root

83
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,960
of 16 is 4.

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,720
So I think you already see how
these two are related.

85
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,920
We've essentially just swapped
the x's and the y's.

86
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,250
Well, these are the same x and
y's, but here you have

87
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,510
x is 2, y is 4.

88
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,020
Here x is 4, y is 2.

89
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,480
3 comma 9, 9 comma 3.

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,730
4 comma 16, 16 comma 4.

91
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,960
And that makes complete sense.

92
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,430
If you were to square both sides
of this equation, you

93
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,150
would get y squared is equal
to x right there.

94
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,530
And, of course, you would want
to restrict the domain of y to

95
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,480
positive y's because this can
only take on positive values

96
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,020
because this is a principal
square root.

97
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,090
But the general idea, we just
swapped the x's and y's

98
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,580
between this function and this
function right here, if you

99
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,620
assume a domain of positive
x's and positive y's.

100
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,550
Now, let's see what the
graphs look like.

101
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,730
And I think you might already
have a guess of-- Let me just

102
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,960
graph them here.

103
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,450
Let me do them by hand because
I think that's instructive

104
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,160
sometimes before you take out
the graphing calculator.

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,180
So I'm just going to stay in
the positive, in the first

106
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,260
quadrant here.

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,800
So let me graph this first.

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,740
So we have the point 0, 0, the
point 1 comma 1, the point 2

109
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,550
comma 2, which I'm going to have
to draw it a little bit

110
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,590
smaller than that.

111
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,280
Let me mark this is 1, 2, 3.

112
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,870
Actually, let me do
it like this.

113
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:49,890
Let me go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

114
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,010
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

115
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,070
That's about how far
I have to go.

116
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:02,340
And then I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

117
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,610
14, 15, 16.

118
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,000
That's about how far I have to
go in that direction as well.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,060
And now let's graph it.

120
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,580
So we have 0, 0, 1, 1,
2 comma 1, 2, 3, 4.

121
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,590
2 comma 4 right there.

122
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,720
3 comma 9.

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,410
3 comma 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

124
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,060
3 comma 9 is right
about there.

125
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,450
And then we have 4 comma 16.

126
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,660
4 comma 16 is going to
be right above there.

127
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,770
So the graph of y is equal
to x squared, and

128
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,200
we've seen this before.

129
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,180
It's going to look something
like this.

130
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,740
We're just graphing it in the
positive quadrant, so we get

131
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,010
this upward opening
u just like that.

132
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,870
Now let's graph y is equal
to the principal

133
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,210
square root of x.

134
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,750
So here, once again,
we have 0, 0.

135
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,490
We have 1 comma 1.

136
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,900
We have 4 comma 2.

137
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,580
1, 2, 3, 4 comma 2.

138
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,140
We have 9 comma 3.

139
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,750
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 comma 3
right about there.

140
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,690
Then we have 16 comma 4.

141
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,390
16 comma 4 is right
about there.

142
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,620
So this graph looks like that.

143
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,480
So notice, they look like
they're kind of

144
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,230
flipped around the axes.

145
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,370
This one opens along the y-axis,
this one opens along

146
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,230
the x-axis.

147
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,110
And once again, it makes
complete sense because we've

148
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,680
swapped the x's and the y's.

149
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,090
Especially if you just consider
the first quadrant.

150
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,460
And actually, these are
symmetric around the line, y

151
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,523
is equal to x.

152
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:42,350
And we'll talk about things like
inverses in the future

153
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,850
that are symmetric around the
line, y is equal to x.

154
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,580
And we can graph this better
on a regular graphing

155
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,720
calculator.

156
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
I found this on the web.

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,425
I just did a quick web search.

158
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:55,800
I want to give proper credit
to the people whose

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,360
resource I'm using.

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,370
So this is my.hrw.com/math06.

161
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,350
You could pause this video.

162
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,580
And hopefully, you should
be able read this.

163
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,490
Especially if you're looking
at it in HD.

164
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,850
But let's graph these
different things.

165
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,270
Let's graph it a little
bit cleaner than

166
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,600
what I can do by hand.

167
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,030
And actually, let me have some
of what I wrote there.

168
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,360
So that

169
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,590
should give you-- OK.

170
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,390
So let's first just graph
y is equal to x squared.

171
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,770
And then in green, let me
graph y is equal to the

172
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,720
square root of x.

173
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,070
They have some buttons here on
the right, just so you know

174
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,650
what I'm doing.

175
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,000
I have some buttons here on
the right: squared and the

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,030
radical sign and all of that.

177
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,110
Let me just focus on this.

178
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,900
So let me just graph those.

179
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,250
So first it did x squared
and then it did the

180
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,050
square root of x.

181
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,500
Look, if you just focus on the
first quadrant right here, you

182
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,680
see that you get the exact same
result that I got over

183
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,120
there, although mine
is messier.

184
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,150
Now, just for fun and, you know,
I really didn't do this

185
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,590
yet with the regular
quadratics,

186
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,730
let's see what happens.

187
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,770
What we need to do to shift
the different graphs.

188
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,250
So with x squared, I'm going
to do two things.

189
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,990
I'm going to scale the graphs
and I'm going to shift them.

190
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,800
So that's x squared.

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,190
So let's just focus on the x
squared and see what happens

192
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,030
when we scale it.

193
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,610
And then I'll do it with the
radical sign as well.

194
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,930
This will really work
for anything.

195
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,480
Let's see what happens when you
get 2 times-- no, not 2

196
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,050
squared --2 times x squared.

197
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:36,070
And let's do another one that is
1.5 times our 0.-- I could

198
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,470
just do 0.4 actually.

199
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,290
0.5 times x squared.

200
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,350
Let's graph these right there.

201
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,190
So x squared.

202
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,290
So notice, our regular x
squared is just in red.

203
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,610
If we scale it by 2, it's still
a parabola with the

204
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,970
vertex at the same place, but
we go up faster in both

205
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,790
directions.

206
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,780
And if we have 0.5 times x
squared, we still have a

207
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,680
parabola, but we go up
a little bit slower.

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,230
We have a wider opening u
because our scaling factor is

209
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,570
lower than 1.

210
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,530
So that's how you kind of decide
how wide or how narrow

211
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,660
the opening of our
parabola is.

212
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,990
And then if you want to shift
it to the left or the right,

213
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,410
and I want you to think
about why this is.

214
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,030
So that's x squared.

215
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,690
Let's say I want to just take
the graph of x squared and I

216
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,040
want to shift it four
to the right.

217
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,396
What I do is I say, x minus 4.

218
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,820
x minus 4 squared.

219
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,640
And if I want to shift it two
to the-- Let's say I want to

220
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,980
shift it two to the
left. x plus 2

221
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,350
squared, what do we get?

222
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,570
Notice it did exactly what I
said. x minus 4 squared was

223
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,960
shifted four to the right.

224
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,750
x plus 2 squared, was shifted
two to the left.

225
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,740
And it might be unintuitive at
first, this shifting that I'm

226
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,530
talking about.

227
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,420
But really think about
what's happening.

228
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,320
Over here, the vertex is
where x is equal to 0.

229
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
When you get 0 squared
up here.

230
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,810
Now over here, the vertex
is when x is equal to 4.

231
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,430
But when x is equal to 4,
you stick 4 in here,

232
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,260
you get 4 minus 4.

233
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,230
So you're still squaring 0.

234
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,410
4 minus 4 is 0 and that's
what you're squaring.

235
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,050
Over here, when x is equal to
negative 2-- negative 2 plus 2

236
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,360
--you are squaring 0.

237
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,370
So, in other words, whatever
you're squaring, that 0 is

238
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,900
equivalent to 4 here.

239
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,660
Or 4 is equivalent to 0.

240
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,790
And negative 2 is equivalent
to 0 over there.

241
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,990
So I want you to think about
it a little bit.

242
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,000
Another way you could think
about it, when x is equal to

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,490
1, we're at this point
of the red parabola.

244
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,070
But when x is equal to 5 on
the green parabola, you

245
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,010
have 5 minus 4.

246
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,060
Inside of the parentheses you
have a 1, just like x is equal

247
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,250
to 1 over here, up here.

248
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,550
So you're at the same point
in the parabola.

249
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,910
So I want you to think about
that a little bit.

250
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,840
It might be a little
non-intuitive that you say

251
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,560
minus 4 to shift to the
right and plus 2 to

252
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,380
shift to the left.

253
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,650
But it actually makes
a lot of sense.

254
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,820
Now, the other interesting
thing is to shift

255
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,950
things up and down.

256
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,760
And that's actually pretty
straightforward.

257
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,200
You want to shift
this curve up.

258
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's say we want to shift the
red curve up a little bit.

259
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,930
You do x squared plus 1.

260
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,130
Notice it got shifted up.

261
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,090
If you want this green curve to
be shifted down by 5, put a

262
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,850
minus 5 right there.

263
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,350
And then you graph it and it
got shifted down by 5.

264
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,620
If you want it to open up a
little wider than that, maybe

265
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,320
scale it down a little bit.

266
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,110
Scale it down and let's
say 0.5 times that.

267
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,440
So now the green curve will be
scaled down and it opens

268
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,570
slower, it has a
wider opening.

269
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,510
And the same idea can
be done with the

270
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,020
principal square roots.

271
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,510
So let me do that.

272
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,180
Let me do the same idea.

273
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,340
And the same idea actually, can
be done with any function.

274
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,260
So let's do the square
root of x.

275
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,570
And in green, let's do
the square root of x.

276
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,140
Let's say, minus 5.

277
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,540
So we're shifting it over
to the right by 5.

278
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,355
And then let's have the square
root of x plus 4.

279
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:07,650
So we're going to shift
it to the left by 4.

280
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,860
Let's shift it down by 3.

281
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,060
And so lets graph
all of these.

282
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,110
The square root of x.

283
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,730
Then have the square
root of x minus 5.

284
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,470
Notice it's the exact same thing
as the square root of x,

285
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,760
but I shifted it to
the right by 5.

286
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,730
When x is equal to 5, I have
a 0 under the radical sign.

287
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,400
Same thing as square
root of 0.

288
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,070
So this point is equivalent
to that point.

289
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,030
Now, when I have the square root
of x plus 4, I've shifted

290
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,630
it over to the left by 4.

291
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,000
When x is negative 4, I have
a 0 under the radical sign.

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,030
So this point is equivalent
to that point.

293
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,140
And then I subtracted 3, which
also shifted it down 3.

294
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,810
So this is my starting point.

295
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:51,660
If I want this blue square root
to open up slower, so

296
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,070
it'll be a little
bit narrower, I

297
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,740
would scale it down.

298
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,900
So here, putting a low number
will scale it down and make it

299
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,770
more narrow because we're
opening along the x-axis.

300
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,430
So let me to do that.

301
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,250
Let me make this green one--
Let me open up wider.

302
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,460
So let me say it's 3 times the
square root of x minus 5.

303
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,780
So let's graph all of these.

304
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,660
So notice, this blue one now
opens up more narrow and this

305
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,640
green one now opens up
a lot, I guess you

306
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,470
could say, a lot faster.

307
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,480
It's scaled up.

308
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,410
Then we could shift that one
up a little bit by 4.

309
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,000
And then we graph it
and there you go.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,240
And notice when we graph these,
it's not a sideways

311
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,120
parabola because we're
talking about the

312
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,540
principal square root.

313
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,450
And if you did the plus or minus
square root, it actually

314
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,020
wouldn't even be a valid
function because you would

315
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,720
have two y values for
every x value.

316
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,780
So that's why we have to just
use the principal square root.

317
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,940
Anyway, hopefully you found
this little talk, I guess,

318
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,900
about the relationships with
parabolas, and/or with the x

319
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,550
squared's and the principal
square roots, useful.

320
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,340
And how to shift them.

321
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,210
And that will actually be really
useful in the future

322
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,840
when we talk about inverses
and shifting functions.

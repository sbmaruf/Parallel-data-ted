CHAPTER III.

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:15,005
Gregor's serious wound, from which he
suffered for over a month--since no one

3
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:20,098
ventured to remove the apple, it remained
in his flesh as a visible reminder--seemed

4
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:23,859
by itself to have reminded the father that,

5
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:29,369
in spite of his present unhappy and hateful
appearance, Gregor was a member of the

6
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,005
family, something one should not treat as
an enemy, and that it was, on the contrary,

7
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:39,109
a requirement of family duty to suppress

8
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:46,028
one's aversion and to endure--nothing else,
just endure.

9
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:51,199
And if through his wound Gregor had now
apparently lost for good his ability to

10
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:58,089
move and for the time being needed many,
many minutes to crawl across his room, like

11
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,269
an aged invalid--so far as creeping up high

12
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:07,014
was concerned, that was unimaginable--
nevertheless for this worsening of his

13
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:13,109
condition, in his opinion, he did get
completely satisfactory compensation,

14
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:15,869
because every day towards evening the door

15
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,829
to the living room, which he was in the
habit of keeping a sharp eye on even one or

16
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:28,000
two hours beforehand, was opened, so that
he, lying down in the darkness of his room,

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,909
invisible from the living room, could see

18
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:37,049
the entire family at the illuminated table
and listen to their conversation, to a

19
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,053
certain extent with their common
permission, a situation quite different

20
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:46,028
from what had happened before.

21
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:51,569
Of course, it was no longer the animated
social interaction of former times, which

22
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,046
Gregor in small hotel rooms had always
thought about with a certain longing, when,

23
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:01,409
tired out, he had had to throw himself into
the damp bedclothes.

24
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,469
For the most part what went on now was very
quiet.

25
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:12,048
After the evening meal, the father fell
asleep quickly in his arm chair.

26
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:18,018
The mother and sister talked guardedly to
each other in the stillness.

27
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:24,099
Bent far over, the mother sewed fine
undergarments for a fashion shop.

28
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,004
The sister, who had taken on a job as a
salesgirl, in the evening studied

29
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:36,007
stenography and French, so as perhaps later
to obtain a better position.

30
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:41,037
Sometimes the father woke up and, as if he
was quite ignorant that he had been asleep,

31
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:47,209
said to the mother "How long you have been
sewing today?" and went right back to

32
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:54,003
sleep, while the mother and the sister
smiled tiredly to each other.

33
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:59,025
With a sort of stubbornness the father
refused to take off his servant's uniform

34
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:05,067
even at home, and while his sleeping gown
hung unused on the coat hook, the father

35
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:09,036
dozed completely dressed in his place, as

36
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:13,087
if he was always ready for his
responsibility and even here was waiting

37
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:17,009
for the voice of his superior.

38
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:23,014
As a result, in spite of all the care of
the mother and sister, his uniform, which

39
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:29,689
even at the start was not new, grew dirty,
and Gregor looked, often for the entire

40
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,069
evening, at this clothing, with stains all

41
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:39,012
over it and with its gold buttons always
polished, in which the old man, although

42
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,719
very uncomfortable, slept peacefully
nonetheless.

43
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:50,059
As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother
tried gently encouraging the father to wake

44
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:55,009
up and then persuading him to go to bed, on
the ground that he couldn't get a proper

45
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,000
sleep here and that the father, who had to

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,034
report for service at six o'clock, really
needed a good sleep.

47
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:09,159
But in his stubbornness, which had gripped
him since he had become a servant, he

48
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,079
insisted always on staying even longer by
the table, although he regularly fell

49
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,047
asleep and then could only be prevailed

50
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:23,001
upon with the greatest difficulty to trade
his chair for the bed.

51
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:27,044
No matter how much the mother and sister
might at that point work on him with small

52
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:33,088
admonitions, for a quarter of an hour he
would remain shaking his head slowly, his

53
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:37,067
eyes closed, without standing up.

54
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:43,032
The mother would pull him by the sleeve and
speak flattering words into his ear; the

55
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,089
sister would leave her work to help her
mother, but that would not have the desired

56
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:50,023
effect on the father.

57
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,081
He would settle himself even more deeply in
his arm chair.

58
00:04:54,081 --> 00:05:00,000
Only when the two women grabbed him under
the armpits would he throw his eyes open,

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,032
look back and forth at the mother and
sister, and habitually say "This is a life.

60
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:11,016
This is the peace and quiet of my old age."

61
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:16,054
And propped up by both women, he would
heave himself up elaborately, as if for him

62
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:22,053
it was the greatest trouble, allow himself
to be led to the door by the women, wave

63
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,091
them away there, and proceed on his own

64
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:30,019
from there, while the mother quickly threw
down her sewing implements and the sister

65
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:36,075
her pen in order to run after the father
and help him some more.

66
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:43,066
In this overworked and exhausted family who
had time to worry any longer about Gregor

67
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:48,055
more than was absolutely necessary?
The household was constantly getting

68
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,000
smaller.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,087
The servant girl was now let go.
A huge bony cleaning woman with white hair

70
00:05:55,087 --> 00:06:00,004
flying all over her head came in the
morning and evening to do the heaviest

71
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:02,022
work.

72
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:07,092
The mother took care of everything else in
addition to her considerable sewing work.

73
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:12,065
It even happened that various pieces of
family jewellery, which previously the

74
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:18,001
mother and sister had been overjoyed to
wear on social and festive occasions, were

75
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:21,056
sold, as Gregor found out in the evening

76
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:24,048
from the general discussion of the prices
they had fetched.

77
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:31,007
But the greatest complaint was always that
they could not leave this apartment, which

78
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:36,095
was too big for their present means, since
it was impossible to imagine how Gregor

79
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,009
might be moved.

80
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:44,016
But Gregor fully recognized that it was not
just consideration for him which was

81
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:49,066
preventing a move, for he could have been
transported easily in a suitable box with a

82
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,000
few air holes.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,087
The main thing holding the family back from
a change in living quarters was far more

84
00:06:56,087 --> 00:07:02,068
their complete hopelessness and the idea
that they had been struck by a misfortune

85
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:10,034
like no one else in their entire circle of
relatives and acquaintances.

86
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:17,003
What the world demands of poor people they
now carried out to an extreme degree.

87
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,012
The father bought breakfast to the petty
officials at the bank, the mother

88
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:28,025
sacrificed herself for the undergarments of
strangers, the sister behind her desk was

89
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:31,091
at the beck and call of customers, but the

90
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:35,041
family's energies did not extend any
further.

91
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:42,028
And the wound in his back began to pain
Gregor all over again, when now mother and

92
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:49,045
sister, after they had escorted the father
to bed, came back, let their work lie,

93
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:52,017
moved close together, and sat cheek to

94
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:58,086
cheek and when his mother would now say,
pointing to Gregor's room, "Close the door,

95
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:05,062
Grete," and when Gregor was again in the
darkness, while close by the women mingled

96
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:12,086
their tears or, quite dry eyed, stared at
the table.

97
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:17,093
Gregor spent his nights and days with
hardly any sleep.

98
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:21,058
Sometimes he thought that the next time the
door opened he would take over the family

99
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:24,093
arrangements just as he had earlier.

100
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:31,065
In his imagination appeared again, after a
long time, his employer and supervisor and

101
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:38,919
the apprentices, the excessively spineless
custodian, two or three friends from other

102
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,719
businesses, a chambermaid from a hotel in

103
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,073
the provinces, a loving fleeting memory, a
female cashier from a hat shop, whom he had

104
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:55,939
seriously but too slowly courted--they all
appeared mixed in with strangers or people

105
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:58,072
he had already forgotten, but instead of

106
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:04,579
helping him and his family, they were all
unapproachable, and he was happy to see

107
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:10,329
them disappear.
But then he was in no mood to worry about

108
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,709
his family.

109
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:17,041
He was filled with sheer anger over the
wretched care he was getting, even though

110
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:22,036
he couldn't imagine anything which he might
have an appetite for.

111
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:27,569
Still, he made plans about how he could
take from the larder what he at all account

112
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,055
deserved, even if he wasn't hungry.

113
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:35,449
Without thinking any more about how they
might be able to give Gregor special

114
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:41,066
pleasure, the sister now kicked some food
or other very quickly into his room in the

115
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,329
morning and at noon, before she ran off to

116
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,025
her shop, and in the evening, quite
indifferent to whether the food had perhaps

117
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:56,209
only been tasted or, what happened most
frequently, remained entirely undisturbed,

118
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,279
she whisked it out with one sweep of her
broom.

119
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,389
The task of cleaning his room, which she
now always carried out in the evening,

120
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,879
could not be done any more quickly.

121
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,008
Streaks of dirt ran along the walls; here
and there lay tangles of dust and garbage.

122
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:21,029
At first, when his sister arrived, Gregor
positioned himself in a particularly filthy

123
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:26,097
corner in order with this posture to make
something of a protest.

124
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:31,089
But he could have well stayed there for
weeks without his sister's changing her

125
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,093
ways.

126
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:39,056
In fact, she perceived the dirt as much as
he did, but she had decided just to let it

127
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,529
stay.

128
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,086
In this business, with a touchiness which
was quite new to her and which had

129
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:53,054
generally taken over the entire family, she
kept watch to see that the cleaning of

130
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:58,009
Gregor's room remained reserved for her.

131
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,759
Once his mother had undertaken a major
cleaning of Gregor's room, which she had

132
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,689
only completed successfully after using a
few buckets of water.

133
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:14,099
But the extensive dampness made Gregor sick
and he lay supine, embittered and immobile

134
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:19,048
on the couch.
However, the mother's punishment was not

135
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,959
delayed for long.

136
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,779
For in the evening the sister had hardly
observed the change in Gregor's room before

137
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:31,001
she ran into the living room mightily
offended and, in spite of her mother's hand

138
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:35,017
lifted high in entreaty, broke out in a fit
of crying.

139
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:42,199
Her parents--the father had, of course,
woken up with a start in his arm chair--at

140
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:46,579
first looked at her astonished and
helpless, until they started to get

141
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,399
agitated.

142
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,569
Turning to his right, the father heaped
reproaches on the mother that she was not

143
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:58,079
to take over the cleaning of Gregor's room
from the sister and, turning to his left,

144
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,649
he shouted at the sister that she would no

145
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:07,029
longer be allowed to clean Gregor's room
ever again, while the mother tried to pull

146
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,839
the father, beside himself in his
excitement, into the bed room.

147
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,569
The sister, shaken by her crying fit,
pounded on the table with her tiny fists,

148
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:25,097
and Gregor hissed at all this, angry that
no one thought about shutting the door and

149
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:30,509
sparing him the sight of this commotion.

150
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:36,149
But even when the sister, exhausted from
her daily work, had grown tired of caring

151
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:43,037
for Gregor as she had before, even then the
mother did not have to come at all on her

152
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:43,899
behalf.

153
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:49,085
And Gregor did not have to be neglected.
For now the cleaning woman was there.

154
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:55,749
This old widow, who in her long life must
have managed to survive the worst with the

155
00:12:55,749 --> 00:13:01,054
help of her bony frame, had no real horror
of Gregor.

156
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:06,199
Without being in the least curious, she had
once by chance opened Gregor's door.

157
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:12,449
At the sight of Gregor, who, totally
surprised, began to scamper here and there,

158
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,199
although no one was chasing him, she
remained standing with her hands folded

159
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,649
across her stomach staring at him.

160
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,008
Since then she did not fail to open the
door furtively a little every morning and

161
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:27,041
evening to look in on Gregor.

162
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:33,509
At first, she also called him to her with
words which she presumably thought were

163
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:40,049
friendly, like "Come here for a bit, old
dung beetle!" or "Hey, look at the old dung

164
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,009
beetle!"

165
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:47,949
Addressed in such a manner, Gregor answered
nothing, but remained motionless in his

166
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:52,529
place, as if the door had not been opened
at all.

167
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:57,589
If only, instead of allowing this cleaning
woman to disturb him uselessly whenever she

168
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,149
felt like it, they had given her orders to
clean up his room every day!

169
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:09,085
One day in the early morning--a hard
downpour, perhaps already a sign of the

170
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:15,055
coming spring, struck the window panes--
when the cleaning woman started up once

171
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,839
again with her usual conversation, Gregor

172
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,089
was so bitter that he turned towards her,
as if for an attack, although slowly and

173
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,869
weakly.

174
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:31,449
But instead of being afraid of him, the
cleaning woman merely lifted up a chair

175
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:37,059
standing close by the door and, as she
stood there with her mouth wide open, her

176
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,449
intention was clear: she would close her

177
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:45,249
mouth only when the chair in her hand had
been thrown down on Gregor's back.

178
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:51,639
"This goes no further, all right?" she
asked, as Gregor turned himself around

179
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,689
again, and she placed the chair calmly back
in the corner.

180
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,079
Gregor ate hardly anything any more.

181
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:07,749
Only when he chanced to move past the food
which had been prepared did he, as a game,

182
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:15,369
take a bit into his mouth, hold it there
for hours, and generally spit it out again.

183
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:19,829
At first he thought it might be his sadness
over the condition of his room which kept

184
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:27,055
him from eating, but he very soon became
reconciled to the alterations in his room.

185
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:31,689
People had grown accustomed to put into
storage in his room things which they

186
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:37,779
couldn't put anywhere else, and at this
point there were many such things, now that

187
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:42,899
they had rented one room of the apartment
to three lodgers.

188
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,098
These solemn gentlemen--all three had full
beards, as Gregor once found out through a

189
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:55,049
crack in the door--were meticulously intent
on tidiness, not only in their own room

190
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:58,098
but, since they had now rented a room here,

191
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:04,036
in the entire household, and particularly
in the kitchen.

192
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:09,769
They simply did not tolerate any useless or
shoddy stuff.

193
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,529
Moreover, for the most part they had
brought with them their own pieces of

194
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:15,029
furniture.

195
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:20,067
Thus, many items had become superfluous,
and these were not really things one could

196
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:24,072
sell or things people wanted to throw out.

197
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:30,091
All these items ended up in Gregor's room,
even the box of ashes and the garbage pail

198
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:33,279
from the kitchen.

199
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,048
The cleaning woman, always in a hurry,
simply flung anything that was momentarily

200
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:44,809
useless into Gregor's room.
Fortunately Gregor generally saw only the

201
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:48,092
relevant object and the hand which held it.

202
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:54,639
The cleaning woman perhaps was intending,
when time and opportunity allowed, to take

203
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,379
the stuff out again or to throw everything
out all at once, but in fact the things

204
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,899
remained lying there, wherever they had

205
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:08,052
ended up at the first throw, unless Gregor
squirmed his way through the accumulation

206
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:10,839
of junk and moved it.

207
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,003
At first he was forced to do this because
otherwise there was no room for him to

208
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:21,088
creep around, but later he did it with a
growing pleasure, although after such

209
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:30,056
movements, tired to death and feeling
wretched, he didn't budge for hours.

210
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:34,062
Because the lodgers sometimes also took
their evening meal at home in the common

211
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:40,005
living room, the door to the living room
stayed shut on many evenings.

212
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:45,001
But Gregor had no trouble at all going
without the open door.

213
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:51,012
Already on many evenings when it was open
he had not availed himself of it, but,

214
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:57,009
without the family noticing, was stretched
out in the darkest corner of his room.

215
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:02,005
However, once the cleaning woman had left
the door to the living room slightly ajar,

216
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:07,033
and it remained open even when the lodgers
came in in the evening and the lights were

217
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,003
put on.

218
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:13,084
They sat down at the head of the table,
where in earlier days the mother, the

219
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:18,084
father, and Gregor had eaten, unfolded
their serviettes, and picked up their

220
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:21,005
knives and forks.

221
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:26,011
The mother immediately appeared in the door
with a dish of meat and right behind her

222
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:30,034
the sister with a dish piled high with
potatoes.

223
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:33,034
The food gave off a lot of steam.

224
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:38,024
The gentlemen lodgers bent over the plate
set before them, as if they wanted to check

225
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:43,073
it before eating, and in fact the one who
sat in the middle--for the other two he

226
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:47,005
seemed to serve as the authority--cut off a

227
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:51,048
piece of meat still on the plate obviously
to establish whether it was sufficiently

228
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:56,037
tender and whether or not something should
be shipped back to the kitchen.

229
00:18:56,037 --> 00:19:02,001
He was satisfied, and mother and sister,
who had looked on in suspense, began to

230
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:09,039
breathe easily and to smile.
The family itself ate in the kitchen.

231
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,014
In spite of that, before the father went
into the kitchen, he came into the room and

232
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:20,002
with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tour
of the table.

233
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:25,012
The lodgers rose up collectively and
murmured something in their beards.

234
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:30,079
Then, when they were alone, they ate almost
in complete silence.

235
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:36,036
It seemed odd to Gregor that, out of all
the many different sorts of sounds of

236
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:42,068
eating, what was always audible was their
chewing teeth, as if by that Gregor should

237
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:45,026
be shown that people needed their teeth to

238
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:50,045
eat and that nothing could be done even
with the most handsome toothless jawbone.

239
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:58,092
"I really do have an appetite," Gregor said
to himself sorrowfully, "but not for these

240
00:19:58,092 --> 00:20:00,034
things.

241
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:07,005
How these lodgers stuff themselves, and I
am dying."

242
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:13,062
On this very evening the violin sounded
from the kitchen.

243
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:18,015
Gregor didn't remember hearing it all
through this period.

244
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:22,053
The lodgers had already ended their night
meal, the middle one had pulled out a

245
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:27,087
newspaper and had given each of the other
two a page, and they were now leaning back,

246
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,078
reading and smoking.

247
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:35,087
When the violin started playing, they
became attentive, got up, and went on

248
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:40,098
tiptoe to the hall door, at which they
remained standing pressed up against one

249
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,055
another.

250
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:47,003
They must have been audible from the
kitchen, because the father called out

251
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:49,051
"Perhaps the gentlemen don't like the
playing?

252
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:50,007
It can be stopped at once."

253
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:56,092
"On the contrary," stated the lodger in the
middle, "might the young woman not come

254
00:20:56,092 --> 00:21:00,051
into us and play in the room here, where it
is really much more comfortable and

255
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:00,098
cheerful?"

256
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:08,005
"Oh, thank you," cried out the father, as
if he were the one playing the violin.

257
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:12,001
The men stepped back into the room and
waited.

258
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:18,000
Soon the father came with the music stand,
the mother with the sheet music, and the

259
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,077
sister with the violin.
The sister calmly prepared everything for

260
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:24,066
the recital.

261
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:29,057
The parents, who had never previously
rented a room and therefore exaggerated

262
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:34,098
their politeness to the lodgers, dared not
sit on their own chairs.

263
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:39,065
The father leaned against the door, his
right hand stuck between two buttons of his

264
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:44,021
buttoned-up uniform.
The mother, however, accepted a chair

265
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:47,019
offered by one lodger.

266
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,045
Since she left the chair sit where the
gentleman had chanced to put it, she sat to

267
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:58,027
one side in a corner.
The sister began to play.

268
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:03,041
The father and mother, one on each side,
followed attentively the movements of her

269
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,029
hands.

270
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:10,001
Attracted by the playing, Gregor had
ventured to advance a little further

271
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:13,097
forward and his head was already in the
living room.

272
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:19,031
He scarcely wondered about the fact that
recently he had had so little consideration

273
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:22,096
for the others.
Earlier this consideration had been

274
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:24,087
something he was proud of.

275
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:30,074
And for that very reason he would have had
at this moment more reason to hide away,

276
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:35,064
because as a result of the dust which lay
all over his room and flew around with the

277
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:40,049
slightest movement, he was totally covered
in dirt.

278
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:47,052
On his back and his sides he carted around
with him dust, threads, hair, and remnants

279
00:22:47,052 --> 00:22:49,029
of food.

280
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:54,054
His indifference to everything was much too
great for him to lie on his back and scour

281
00:22:54,054 --> 00:23:00,042
himself on the carpet, as he often had done
earlier during the day.

282
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:06,004
In spite of his condition he had no
timidity about inching forward a bit on the

283
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:13,018
spotless floor of the living room.
In any case, no one paid him any attention.

284
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:16,077
The family was all caught up in the violin
playing.

285
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:21,083
The lodgers, by contrast, who for the
moment had placed themselves, hands in

286
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:28,012
their trouser pockets, behind the music
stand much too close to the sister, so that

287
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,041
they could all see the sheet music,

288
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:35,051
something that must certainly bother the
sister, soon drew back to the window

289
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:41,006
conversing in low voices with bowed heads,
where they then remained, worriedly

290
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:44,009
observed by the father.

291
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:48,075
It now seemed really clear that, having
assumed they were to hear a beautiful or

292
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:54,035
entertaining violin recital, they were
disappointed and were allowing their peace

293
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:59,078
and quiet to be disturbed only out of
politeness.

294
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:03,092
The way in which they all blew the smoke
from their cigars out of their noses and

295
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:10,004
mouths in particular led one to conclude
that they were very irritated.

296
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:13,091
And yet his sister was playing so
beautifully.

297
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:19,069
Her face was turned to the side, her gaze
followed the score intently and sadly.

298
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:26,007
Gregor crept forward still a little
further, keeping his head close against the

299
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:32,001
floor in order to be able to catch her gaze
if possible.

300
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:36,001
Was he an animal that music so captivated
him?

301
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:42,076
For him it was as if the way to the unknown
nourishment he craved was revealing itself.

302
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:49,001
He was determined to press forward right to
his sister, to tug at her dress, and to

303
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:55,039
indicate to her in this way that she might
still come with her violin into his room,

304
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,025
because here no one valued the recital as
he wanted to value it.

305
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:08,032
He did not wish to let her go from his room
any more, at least not as long as he lived.

306
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:12,071
His frightening appearance would for the
first time become useful for him.

307
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:18,096
He wanted to be at all the doors of his
room simultaneously and snarl back at the

308
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:21,029
attackers.

309
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:26,069
However, his sister should not be compelled
but would remain with him voluntarily.

310
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:32,026
She would sit next to him on the sofa, bend
down her ear to him, and he would then

311
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:39,043
confide in her that he firmly intended to
send her to the conservatory and that, if

312
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,048
his misfortune had not arrived in the

313
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:47,012
interim, he would have declared all this
last Christmas--had Christmas really

314
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,045
already come and gone?--and would have
brooked no argument.

315
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:58,022
After this explanation his sister would
break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor

316
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:04,004
would lift himself up to her armpit and
kiss her throat, which she, from the time

317
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:11,066
she started going to work, had left exposed
without a band or a collar.

318
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:16,088
"Mr. Samsa," called out the middle lodger
to the father and, without uttering a

319
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:24,001
further word, pointed his index finger at
Gregor as he was moving slowly forward.

320
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,041
The violin fell silent.

321
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:32,032
The middle lodger smiled, first shaking his
head once at his friends, and then looked

322
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:35,097
down at Gregor once more.

323
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:40,003
Rather than driving Gregor back again, the
father seemed to consider it of prime

324
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:45,061
importance to calm down the lodgers,
although they were not at all upset and

325
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:50,005
Gregor seemed to entertain them more than
the violin recital.

326
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:55,012
The father hurried over to them and with
outstretched arms tried to push them into

327
00:26:55,012 --> 00:27:01,044
their own room and simultaneously to block
their view of Gregor with his own body.

328
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:05,074
At this point they became really somewhat
irritated, although one no longer knew

329
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:10,051
whether that was because of the father's
behaviour or because of knowledge they had

330
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:15,053
just acquired that they had, without
knowing it, a neighbour like Gregor.

331
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:21,061
They demanded explanations from his father,
raised their arms to make their points,

332
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:28,062
tugged agitatedly at their beards, and
moved back towards their room quite slowly.

333
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:33,077
In the meantime, the isolation which had
suddenly fallen upon his sister after the

334
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:38,036
sudden breaking off of the recital had
overwhelmed her.

335
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:43,048
She had held onto the violin and bow in her
limp hands for a little while and had

336
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:48,003
continued to look at the sheet music as if
she was still playing.

337
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:53,059
All at once she pulled herself together,
placed the instrument in her mother's lap--

338
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,000
the mother was still sitting in her chair
having trouble breathing for her lungs were

339
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,079
labouring--and had run into the next room,

340
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:08,019
which the lodgers, pressured by the father,
were already approaching more rapidly.

341
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:13,021
One could observe how under the sister's
practiced hands the sheets and pillows on

342
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:17,032
the beds were thrown on high and arranged.

343
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:22,002
Even before the lodgers had reached the
room, she was finished fixing the beds and

344
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:24,036
was slipping out.

345
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:29,012
The father seemed so gripped once again
with his stubbornness that he forgot about

346
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:32,067
the respect which he always owed to his
renters.

347
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:37,017
He pressed on and on, until at the door of
the room the middle gentleman stamped

348
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:41,029
loudly with his foot and thus brought the
father to a standstill.

349
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:46,093
"I hereby declare," the middle lodger said,
raising his hand and casting his glance

350
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:51,024
both on the mother and the sister, "that
considering the disgraceful conditions

351
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:54,036
prevailing in this apartment and family"--

352
00:28:54,036 --> 00:29:00,041
with this he spat decisively on the floor--
"I immediately cancel my room.

353
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:04,087
I will, of course, pay nothing at all for
the days which I have lived here; on the

354
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:09,058
contrary I shall think about whether or not
I will initiate some sort of action against

355
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:15,078
you, something which--believe me--will be
very easy to establish."

356
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:21,009
He fell silent and looked directly in front
of him, as if he was waiting for something.

357
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:27,001
In fact, his two friends immediately joined
in with their opinions, "We also give

358
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:32,006
immediate notice."
At that he seized the door handle, banged

359
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:36,042
the door shut, and locked it.

360
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:42,009
The father groped his way tottering to his
chair and let himself fall in it.

361
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:47,062
It looked as if he was stretching out for
his usual evening snooze, but the heavy

362
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:53,036
nodding of his head, which looked as if it
was without support, showed that he was not

363
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,023
sleeping at all.

364
00:29:55,023 --> 00:30:00,042
Gregor had lain motionless the entire time
in the spot where the lodgers had caught

365
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:00,082
him.

366
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:06,052
Disappointment with the collapse of his
plan and perhaps also weakness brought on

367
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:11,024
by his severe hunger made it impossible for
him to move.

368
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:15,009
He was certainly afraid that a general
disaster would break over him at any

369
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:18,033
moment, and he waited.

370
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:23,057
He was not even startled when the violin
fell from the mother's lap, out from under

371
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:29,023
her trembling fingers, and gave off a
reverberating tone.

372
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:34,053
"My dear parents," said the sister banging
her hand on the table by way of an

373
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:39,015
introduction, "things cannot go on any
longer in this way.

374
00:30:39,015 --> 00:30:42,061
Maybe if you don't understand that, well,
I do.

375
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:47,022
I will not utter my brother's name in front
of this monster, and thus I say only that

376
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:49,059
we must try to get rid of it.

377
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:54,045
We have tried what is humanly possible to
take care of it and to be patient.

378
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:58,067
I believe that no one can criticize us in
the slightest."

379
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:03,083
"She is right in a thousand ways," said the
father to himself.

380
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:09,003
The mother, who was still incapable of
breathing properly, began to cough numbly

381
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:15,094
with her hand held up over her mouth and a
manic expression in her eyes.

382
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:20,003
The sister hurried over to her mother and
held her forehead.

383
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,077
The sister's words seemed to have led the
father to certain reflections.

384
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:30,023
He sat upright, played with his uniform hat
among the plates, which still lay on the

385
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:35,061
table from the lodgers' evening meal, and
looked now and then at the motionless

386
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,014
Gregor.

387
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:43,047
"We must try to get rid of it," the sister
now said decisively to the father, for the

388
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:46,005
mother, in her coughing fit, was not
listening to anything.

389
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,009
"It is killing you both.

390
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:52,046
I see it coming.
When people have to work as hard as we all

391
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:57,048
do, they cannot also tolerate this endless
torment at home.

392
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,014
I just can't go on any more."

393
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:06,036
And she broke out into such a crying fit
that her tears flowed out down onto her

394
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:10,022
mother's face.
She wiped them off her mother with

395
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:13,046
mechanical motions of her hands.

396
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:19,021
"Child," said the father sympathetically
and with obvious appreciation, "then what

397
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,032
should we do?"

398
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:26,071
The sister only shrugged her shoulders as a
sign of the perplexity which, in contrast

399
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:30,068
to her previous confidence, had come over
her while she was crying.

400
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:38,051
"If only he understood us," said the father
in a semi-questioning tone.

401
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:43,053
The sister, in the midst of her sobbing,
shook her hand energetically as a sign that

402
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:46,053
there was no point thinking of that.

403
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:51,082
"If he only understood us," repeated the
father and by shutting his eyes he absorbed

404
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:56,034
the sister's conviction of the
impossibility of this point, "then perhaps

405
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:58,059
some compromise would be possible with him.

406
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,015
But as it is.
.

407
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:03,005
."
"It must be gotten rid of," cried the

408
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,001
sister.

409
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:08,004
"That is the only way, father.
You must try to get rid of the idea that

410
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:12,072
this is Gregor.
The fact that we have believed for so long,

411
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:14,095
that is truly our real misfortune.

412
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:19,072
But how can it be Gregor?
If it were Gregor, he would have long ago

413
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:25,079
realized that a communal life among human
beings is not possible with such an animal

414
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,064
and would have gone away voluntarily.

415
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:35,008
Then we would not have a brother, but we
could go on living and honour his memory.

416
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:37,000
But this animal plagues us.

417
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,072
It drives away the lodgers, will obviously
take over the entire apartment, and leave

418
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:48,047
us to spend the night in the alley.
Just look, father," she suddenly cried out,

419
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:51,029
"he's already starting up again."

420
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,078
With a fright which was totally
incomprehensible to Gregor, the sister even

421
00:33:55,078 --> 00:34:00,059
left the mother, pushed herself away from
her chair, as if she would sooner sacrifice

422
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,029
her mother than remain in Gregor's

423
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:09,022
vicinity, and rushed behind her father who,
excited merely by her behaviour, also stood

424
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:15,299
up and half raised his arms in front of the
sister as though to protect her.

425
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:20,889
But Gregor did not have any notion of
wishing to create problems for anyone and

426
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:23,759
certainly not for his sister.

427
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:29,619
He had just started to turn himself around
in order to creep back into his room, quite

428
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:35,339
a startling sight, since, as a result of
his suffering condition, he had to guide

429
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,069
himself through the difficulty of turning

430
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:43,359
around with his head, in this process
lifting and banging it against the floor

431
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,049
several times.
He paused and looked around.

432
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:52,289
His good intentions seem to have been
recognized.

433
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:57,004
The fright had lasted only for a moment.
Now they looked at him in silence and

434
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:59,039
sorrow.

435
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:05,099
His mother lay in her chair, with her legs
stretched out and pressed together; her

436
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,072
eyes were almost shut from weariness.
The father and sister sat next to one

437
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:12,019
another.

438
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:16,063
The sister had set her hands around the
father's neck.

439
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:22,619
"Now perhaps I can actually turn myself
around," thought Gregor and began the task

440
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,039
again.

441
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,099
He couldn't stop puffing at the effort and
had to rest now and then.

442
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:36,349
Besides, no one was urging him on.
It was all left to him on his own.

443
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:42,249
When he had completed turning around, he
immediately began to wander straight back.

444
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:47,014
He was astonished at the great distance
which separated him from his room and did

445
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:51,048
not understand in the least how in his
weakness he had covered the same distance a

446
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:56,999
short time before, almost without noticing
it.

447
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:02,019
Constantly intent only on creeping along
quickly, he hardly paid any attention to

448
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:07,047
the fact that no word or cry from his
family interrupted him.

449
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:12,009
Only when he was already in the door did he
turn his head, not completely, because he

450
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:18,009
felt his neck growing stiff.
At any rate he still saw that behind him

451
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,046
nothing had changed.

452
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:25,069
Only the sister was standing up.
His last glimpse brushed over the mother

453
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:27,024
who was now completely asleep.

454
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:34,619
Hardly was he inside his room when the door
was pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast,

455
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,109
and barred.

456
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:42,079
Gregor was startled by the sudden commotion
behind him, so much so that his little

457
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,002
limbs bent double under him.
It was his sister who had been in such a

458
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:47,094
hurry.

459
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:54,073
She had stood up right away, had waited,
and had then sprung forward nimbly.

460
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:57,073
Gregor had not heard anything of her
approach.

461
00:36:57,073 --> 00:37:05,023
She cried out "Finally!" to her parents, as
she turned the key in the lock.

462
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:09,569
"What now?"
Gregor asked himself and looked around him

463
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:11,509
in the darkness.

464
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:16,015
He soon made the discovery that he could no
longer move at all.

465
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,067
He was not surprised at that.

466
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:23,063
On the contrary, it struck him as unnatural
that up to this point he had really been

467
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:27,249
able up to move around with these thin
little legs.

468
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:31,016
Besides he felt relatively content.

469
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:36,073
True, he had pains throughout his entire
body, but it seemed to him that they were

470
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:42,066
gradually becoming weaker and weaker and
would finally go away completely.

471
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:48,038
The rotten apple in his back and the
inflamed surrounding area, entirely covered

472
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:54,065
with white dust, he hardly noticed.
He remembered his family with deep feelings

473
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,529
of love.

474
00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:02,579
In this business, his own thought that he
had to disappear was, if possible, even

475
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,091
more decisive than his sister's.

476
00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:11,039
He remained in this state of empty and
peaceful reflection until the tower clock

477
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,021
struck three o'clock in the morning.
From the window he witnessed the beginning

478
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:19,059
of the general dawning outside.

479
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:25,499
Then without willing it, his head sank all
the way down, and from his nostrils flowed

480
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:32,017
out weakly his last breath.
Early in the morning the cleaning woman

481
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,018
came.

482
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:39,074
In her sheer energy and haste she banged
all the doors--in precisely the way people

483
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:45,009
had already asked her to avoid--so much so
that once she arrived a quiet sleep was no

484
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:50,299
longer possible anywhere in the entire
apartment.

485
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:56,549
In her customarily brief visit to Gregor
she at first found nothing special.

486
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:00,073
She thought he lay so immobile there
because he wanted to play the offended

487
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:04,094
party.
She gave him credit for as complete an

488
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:07,089
understanding as possible.

489
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:12,339
Since she happened to be holding the long
broom in her hand, she tried to tickle

490
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:14,071
Gregor with it from the door.

491
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:21,046
When that was quite unsuccessful, she
became irritated and poked Gregor a little,

492
00:39:21,046 --> 00:39:26,289
and only when she had shoved him from his
place without any resistance did she become

493
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:28,047
attentive.

494
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:35,017
When she quickly realized the true state of
affairs, her eyes grew large, she whistled

495
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:39,869
to herself.
However, she didn't restrain herself for

496
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:40,043
long.

497
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:46,024
She pulled open the door of the bedroom and
yelled in a loud voice into the darkness,

498
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:48,839
"Come and look.
It's kicked the bucket.

499
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,038
It's lying there, totally snuffed!"

500
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:57,041
The Samsa married couple sat upright in
their marriage bed and had to get over

501
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:01,069
their fright at the cleaning woman before
they managed to grasp her message.

502
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:10,039
But then Mr. and Mrs. Samsa climbed very
quickly out of bed, one on either side.

503
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,069
Mr. Samsa threw the bedspread over his
shoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her

504
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:20,007
night-shirt, and like this they stepped
into Gregor's room.

505
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:25,269
Meanwhile, the door of the living room, in
which Grete had slept since the lodgers had

506
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,799
arrived on the scene, had also opened.

507
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:35,079
She was fully clothed, as if she had not
slept at all; her white face also seem to

508
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:35,869
indicate that.

509
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:42,089
"Dead?" said Mrs. Samsa and looked
questioningly at the cleaning woman,

510
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:47,829
although she could check everything on her
own and even understand without a check.

511
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:53,739
"I should say so," said the cleaning woman
and, by way of proof, poked Gregor's body

512
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:58,014
with the broom a considerable distance more
to the side.

513
00:40:58,014 --> 00:41:04,072
Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wished
to restrain the broom, but didn't do it.

514
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:08,999
"Well," said Mr. Samsa, "now we can give
thanks to God."

515
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:14,094
He crossed himself, and the three women
followed his example.

516
00:41:14,094 --> 00:41:21,109
Grete, who did not take her eyes off the
corpse, said, "Look how thin he was.

517
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:25,599
He had eaten nothing for such a long time.

518
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,043
The meals which came in here came out again
exactly the same."

519
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:34,039
In fact, Gregor's body was completely flat
and dry.

520
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:40,047
That was apparent really for the first
time, now that he was no longer raised on

521
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:46,039
his small limbs and nothing else distracted
one's gaze.

522
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:52,589
"Grete, come into us for a moment," said
Mrs. Samsa with a melancholy smile, and

523
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:58,739
Grete went, not without looking back at the
corpse, behind her parents into the bed

524
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,299
room.

525
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:04,065
The cleaning woman shut the door and opened
the window wide.

526
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:10,014
In spite of the early morning, the fresh
air was partly tinged with warmth.

527
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:14,999
It was already the end of March.

528
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:19,096
The three lodgers stepped out of their room
and looked around for their breakfast,

529
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:22,067
astonished that they had been forgotten.

530
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:27,041
"Where is the breakfast?" asked the middle
one of the gentlemen grumpily to the

531
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,002
cleaning woman.

532
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:34,809
However, she laid her finger to her lips
and then quickly and silently indicated to

533
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:38,319
the lodgers that they could come into
Gregor's room.

534
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,609
So they came and stood in the room, which
was already quite bright, around Gregor's

535
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,064
corpse, their hands in the pockets of their
somewhat worn jackets.

536
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:55,579
Then the door of the bed room opened, and
Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform, with his

537
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:58,369
wife on one arm and his daughter on the
other.

538
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,009
All were a little tear stained.

539
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:07,014
Now and then Grete pressed her face onto
her father's arm.

540
00:43:07,014 --> 00:43:12,088
"Get out of my apartment immediately," said
Mr. Samsa and pulled open the door, without

541
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:14,071
letting go of the women.

542
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:21,071
"What do you mean?" said the middle lodger,
somewhat dismayed and with a sugary smile.

543
00:43:21,071 --> 00:43:26,039
The two others kept their hands behind them
and constantly rubbed them against each

544
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:32,619
other, as if in joyful anticipation of a
great squabble which must end up in their

545
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:32,096
favour.

546
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:38,038
"I mean exactly what I say," replied Mr.
Samsa and went directly with his two female

547
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:41,749
companions up to the lodger.

548
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:47,589
The latter at first stood there motionless
and looked at the floor, as if matters were

549
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:51,044
arranging themselves in a new way in his
head.

550
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:57,539
"All right, then we'll go," he said and
looked up at Mr. Samsa as if, suddenly

551
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:04,089
overcome by humility, he was asking fresh
permission for this decision.

552
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:08,509
Mr. Samsa merely nodded to him repeatedly
with his eyes open wide.

553
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:15,799
Following that, the lodger actually went
with long strides immediately out into the

554
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:16,096
hall.

555
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:22,289
His two friends had already been listening
for a while with their hands quite still,

556
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:27,015
and now they hopped smartly after him, as
if afraid that Mr. Samsa could step into

557
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:31,839
the hall ahead of them and disturb their
reunion with their leader.

558
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,799
In the hall all three of them took their
hats from the coat rack, pulled their canes

559
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:43,019
from the cane holder, bowed silently, and
left the apartment.

560
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:48,089
In what turned out to be an entirely
groundless mistrust, Mr. Samsa stepped with

561
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:54,013
the two women out onto the landing, leaned
against the railing, and looked over as the

562
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:56,769
three lodgers slowly but steadily made

563
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:02,042
their way down the long staircase,
disappeared on each floor in a certain turn

564
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:06,089
of the stairwell, and in a few seconds came
out again.

565
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:12,749
The deeper they proceeded, the more the
Samsa family lost interest in them, and

566
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:17,549
when a butcher with a tray on his head come
to meet them and then with a proud bearing

567
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,619
ascended the stairs high above them, Mr.

568
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:26,119
Samsa., together with the women, left the
banister, and they all returned, as if

569
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:33,489
relieved, back into their apartment.
They decided to pass that day resting and

570
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:35,609
going for a stroll.

571
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:40,309
Not only had they earned this break from
work, but there was no question that they

572
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:42,579
really needed it.

573
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:49,019
And so they sat down at the table and wrote
three letters of apology: Mr. Samsa to his

574
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:54,249
supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and
Grete to her proprietor.

575
00:45:54,249 --> 00:46:00,759
During the writing the cleaning woman came
in to say that she was going off, for her

576
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:05,349
morning work was finished.
The three people writing at first merely

577
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,092
nodded, without glancing up.

578
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:12,066
Only when the cleaning woman was still
unwilling to depart, did they look up

579
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:17,047
angrily.
"Well?" asked Mr. Samsa.

580
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:22,014
The cleaning woman stood smiling in the
doorway, as if she had a great stroke of

581
00:46:22,014 --> 00:46:28,069
luck to report to the family but would only
do it if she was asked directly.

582
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:34,069
The almost upright small ostrich feather in
her hat, which had irritated Mr. Samsa

583
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:39,094
during her entire service, swayed lightly
in all directions.

584
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:44,819
"All right then, what do you really want?"
asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady

585
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:47,769
still usually respected.

586
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:52,059
"Well," answered the cleaning woman,
smiling so happily she couldn't go on

587
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:57,019
speaking right away, "about how that
rubbish from the next room should be thrown

588
00:46:57,019 --> 00:46:59,779
out, you mustn't worry about it.

589
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:05,072
It's all taken care of."
Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down to their

590
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:09,539
letters, as though they wanted to go on
writing.

591
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:14,002
Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the cleaning
woman wanted to start describing everything

592
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:19,096
in detail, decisively prevented her with an
outstretched hand.

593
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:25,509
But since she was not allowed to explain,
she remembered the great hurry she was in,

594
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:32,789
and called out, clearly insulted, "Bye bye,
everyone," turned around furiously and left

595
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:38,029
the apartment with a fearful slamming of
the door.

596
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:43,309
"This evening she'll be let go," said Mr.
Samsa, but he got no answer from either his

597
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:48,539
wife or from his daughter, because the
cleaning woman seemed to have upset once

598
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,569
again the tranquillity they had just
attained.

599
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:58,079
They got up, went to the window, and
remained there, with their arms about each

600
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,095
other.

601
00:47:59,095 --> 00:48:05,489
Mr. Samsa turned around in his chair in
their direction and observed them quietly

602
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:09,989
for a while.
Then he called out, "All right, come here

603
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:10,069
then.

604
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:16,739
Let's finally get rid of old things.
And have a little consideration for me."

605
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:21,042
The women attended to him at once.
They rushed to him, caressed him, and

606
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:25,259
quickly ended their letters.

607
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:30,069
Then all three left the apartment together,
something they had not done for months now,

608
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:36,019
and took the electric tram into the open
air outside the city.

609
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:41,029
The car in which they were sitting by
themselves was totally engulfed by the warm

610
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:42,004
sun.

611
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:47,016
Leaning back comfortably in their seats,
they talked to each other about future

612
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:52,739
prospects, and they discovered that on
closer observation these were not at all

613
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:56,599
bad, for the three of them had employment,

614
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:01,049
about which they had not really questioned
each other at all, which was extremely

615
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:06,069
favourable and with especially promising
prospects.

616
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:10,979
The greatest improvement in their situation
at this moment, of course, had to come from

617
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:13,002
a change of dwelling.

618
00:49:13,002 --> 00:49:17,839
Now they wanted to rent an apartment
smaller and cheaper but better situated and

619
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,539
generally more practical than the present
one, which Gregor had found.

620
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:29,539
While they amused themselves in this way,
it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa, almost at the

621
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:34,007
same moment, how their daughter, who was
getting more animated all the time, had

622
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:37,559
blossomed recently, in spite of all the

623
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:43,289
troubles which had made her cheeks pale,
into a beautiful and voluptuous young

624
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:44,009
woman.

625
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:49,041
Growing more silent and almost
unconsciously understanding each other in

626
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:55,089
their glances, they thought that the time
was now at hand to seek out a good honest

627
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:56,089
man for her.

628
00:49:56,089 --> 00:50:01,092
And it was something of a confirmation of
their new dreams and good intentions when

629
00:50:01,092 --> 99:59:59,000
at the end of their journey their daughter
got up first and stretched her young body.

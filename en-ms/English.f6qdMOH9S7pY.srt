1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,620
The goal of this video is to
explore some of the concepts,

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,590
or formulas you might see in
a traditional physics class.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,460
But even more importantly to see
that they're really just common

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,540
sense ideas.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's just start
with a simple example.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Let's say that-- and for
the sake of this video

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,947
just so I don't
have to keep saying

9
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:19,530
this is the magnitude
of the velocity,

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,029
this is the direction of the
velocity, et cetera, et cetera.

11
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:24,870
Let's just assume that if I
have a positive number that it

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,580
means, for example, if I
have a positive velocity,

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,994
it means that I am
going to the right.

14
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,369
And let's say if I have a
negative number, which we won't

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,987
see in this video, let's assume
that I'm going to the left.

16
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,820
And that way I can just
write a number down,

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,700
are we're only operating
in one dimension.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,158
You know that it
is specifying what

19
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:41,720
the magnitude and
the direction is.

20
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,072
If I said the velocity is
five meters per second,

21
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:46,030
that means five meters
per second to the right.

22
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,120
If I say it's negative
five meters per second,

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,480
that means it's five meters
per second to the left.

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,220
Now let's just say
just for simplicity,

25
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,430
let's just say we start
with an initial velocity,

26
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,317
of five meters per second.

27
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:01,400
And once again, I am
specifying both the magnitude

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,150
and the direction.

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,370
Because of this convention here,
we know it is to the right.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,050
And let's say that we have
a constant acceleration.

31
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,010
We have a constant
acceleration at play

32
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,310
of two meters per
second, per second,

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,730
or two meters per
second squared.

34
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,470
And once again, since this is
positive, it is to the right.

35
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,340
And let's say that we
do this for a duration.

36
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,810
So my change in
time is- let's say

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,560
we do this for a duration
of four-- I'll just use s.

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,520
So I don't use seconds
and then sec, and then

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,580
s in different places.

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,150
So s for this video is seconds.

41
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,170
So I want to do is think
about how far do we travel.

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,860
Well there's two things.

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
How fast are we going
after four seconds,

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,490
and how far have we traveled
over the course of those four

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,610
seconds.

46
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,960
So let's draw ourselves a
little bit of a diagram here.

47
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,840
So this is my velocity axis and
this over here is my time axis.

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,490
I can draw a straighter
line than that.

49
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,010
So that is my time axis.

50
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,940
This is velocity.

51
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,050

52
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,250
That is my velocity
right over there.

53
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,890
And I'm starting off at
five meters per second.

54
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,820
So this is five meters per
second right over here.

55
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,650
So v i is equal to
five meters per second.

56
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,530
And then every second
that goes by, I'm

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,380
going two meters
per second faster.

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,060
Because it's two meters
per second, per second.

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,710
So every second that goes
by-- so after one second,

60
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,740
I'm going to go two
meters per second faster.

61
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,876
So I'll be at seven.

62
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,250
Or another way to
think about it,

63
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,080
is the slope of
this velocity line

64
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,645
is my constant acceleration.

65
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:44,310
Or I have a constant slope here.

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,440
So it might look something
look something like that.

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,290
So what has happened
after four seconds?

68
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,860
So one, two, three, four.

69
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,470
So this is my delta t.

70
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,380
So my final velocity is
going to be right over there.

71
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,112

72
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:03,820
I'll write it down
here just because it's

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,080
getting in the way of
this word velocity.

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,830
And so this is v. This
is my final velocity.

75
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,150
And what would it be?

76
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,690
Well I'm starting at
five meters per second.

77
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,780
So I'm going to do it
both, using the variables,

78
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,800
and using the concrete numbers.

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,940
So starting at some
initial velocity.

80
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,750
The subscript i
says i for initial.

81
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,720
And then each second
that goes by, I'm

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,830
getting this much faster.

83
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,470
So if I want to see how
much faster have I gone,

84
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,640
I multiply the
number of seconds--

85
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,180
I'll just multiply the
number of seconds that go by,

86
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,265
times my acceleration.

87
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:42,300

88
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,800
And once again, this
right here, I just

89
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
wrote the subscript
c saying that it's

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,120
a constant acceleration.

91
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,650
And so that will tell
me how fast I've gone.

92
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,310
If I start at this
point, and I multiply

93
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,950
the duration times my
slope, I will get this high.

94
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,475
I will get to my final velocity.

95
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,365

96
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:03,455
And just to make it
clear with the numbers,

97
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,080
these numbers really
could be anything,

98
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,990
I'm just picking these to
make it concrete in your mind.

99
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,330
You have five meters per
second, plus four seconds,

100
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,760
plus-- I want to
do that in yellow--

101
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,680
plus four seconds times
our acceleration of two

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,500
meters per second squared.

103
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,900

104
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,814
And what is this
going to be equal to?

105
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:29,230
You have the seconds canceling
out with one of the seconds

106
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,450
down here.

107
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,640
So let me write it.

108
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,210
So we have five
meters per second,

109
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,100
plus four times two is eight.

110
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,996
This second's gone.

111
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,620
We're just left with
meters per second.

112
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,580
Eight meters per second.

113
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,490
Or this is the same thing as
13 meters per second, which

114
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,837
is going to be our
final velocity.

115
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,170
And I want to take a pause here.

116
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,961
And you can pause and
think about yourself.

117
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,710
This hopefully
should be intuitive.

118
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,780
We were starting at going
five meters per second.

119
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,590
Every second that
goes by we're going

120
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,920
to go two meters
per second faster.

121
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,630
So after one second we will
be at seven meters per second.

122
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,870
After two seconds we will be
at nine meters per second.

123
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,142
After three seconds we will
be 11 meters per second.

124
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:15,600
And then after four
seconds we will

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,420
be at 13 meters per second.

126
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,220
So you multiply how much time
passed times acceleration.

127
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,460
This is how much faster,
we're going to be going.

128
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,520
If we're already going
five meters per second.

129
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,220
Five plus how much faster?

130
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,250
13 meters per second.

131
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,150
So this right up here
is 13 meters per second.

132
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,840
So, I'll take a
little pause here.

133
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,340
Hopefully that's intuitive.

134
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,090
And the whole point
of that is to show you

135
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,867
that this formula that you'll
often see in many physics

136
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,200
books-- It's not just something
that randomly popped out

137
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,330
of the air-- it just makes
complete common sense.

138
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,190
Now the next thing
I want to talk about

139
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,250
is what is the total distance
that we would have traveled.

140
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,630
Now we know from the last
video that distance is just

141
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,970
the area under this
curve right over here.

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,440
So it's just the area
under this curve.

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,870
You say wait, this is kind of
a strange shape right here.

144
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,540
How do I calculate its area?

145
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,470
And we can just use a
little simple geometry

146
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,790
to break it down into
two different areas, that

147
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,740
are very easy to
calculate their areas.

148
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,000
Or two simple shapes.

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,950
You can break it down into
this blue part, this rectangle

150
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,510
right over here.

151
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,670
Easy to figure out the
area of a rectangle.

152
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,030
And we could break it down
into this purple part.

153
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,490
This triangle right here.

154
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,920
Easy to figure out the
area of a triangle.

155
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,890
And that will be the
total distance we travel.

156
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,330
And even this will hopefully
make some intuition.

157
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,000
Because this blue
area is how far would

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,470
we have traveled if we
were not accelerating.

159
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,330
If we just went five meters
per second, for four seconds.

160
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,192
So if you go five meters
per second times--

161
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,400
so this is one second, two
second, three second, four

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,320
second.

163
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,020
So you're going from
times zero to time four,

164
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,020
your change in time
is four seconds.

165
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,330
So if you go five meters per
second, for four seconds,

166
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,610
you're going to go 20 meters.

167
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,360
This right here is 20 meters.

168
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
That is the area
of this right here.

169
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Five times four.

170
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,750
This purple or
magenta area tells you

171
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,040
how further than
this, are you going,

172
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,050
because you are
accelerating, because you

173
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,840
kept going faster and
faster and faster.

174
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,400
And it's pretty easy
to calculate this area.

175
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,850
The base here is still
five, because that's

176
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,090
five seconds have gone by.

177
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,750
And what's the height here?

178
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,740
The height here is
my final velocity

179
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,275
minus my initial velocity.

180
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,590

181
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,240
Or it's the change in velocity
due to the acceleration.

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,860
And the change in velocity
due to the acceleration.

183
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,200
13 minus five is eight.

184
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,810
Or it's this 8 right over here.

185
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,300
It is eight meters per second.

186
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,290
So this height right over here
is eight meters per second.

187
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,720
The base right over
here is four seconds.

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,320
That's the time that past.

189
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,230
So what's the area
of this triangle?

190
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,760
Area of a triangle is
one half, times the base,

191
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,000
which is four seconds,
times the height, which

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,570
is eight meters per second.

193
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,940
Seconds cancel out.

194
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,540
One half times four
is two, times eight

195
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,130
is equal to 16 meters.

196
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,850
So the total distance we
traveled is 20 plus 16,

197
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,090
is 36 meters.

198
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,250
That is the total, or I could
say the total displacement,

199
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,010
and once again, it's to the
right, since it is positive.

200
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,590
So this is our displacement.

201
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,054
Now what I want to do is do
this exact same calculation,

202
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:39,720
but keep it in variable
form and that'll

203
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,500
give another formula that many
people, many often memorize.

204
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,000
But I want you to
understand it it's

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,100
a completely intuitive
formula, and it just

206
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,400
comes out of the logical
flow of reasoning

207
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,410
that we went through
in this video.

208
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,670
What is the area?

209
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,320
Once again, if we just
think about the variables.

210
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,790
Well, the area of
this rectangle right

211
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,100
here is our initial velocity,
times our change in time.

212
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,900

213
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,460
So this is the blue
rectangle right over here.

214
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,770
And then plus-- what
do we have to do--

215
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,960
we have the change
in time, once again,

216
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,730
we have the change in
time, times this height.

217
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,560
Which is our final velocity.

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,220
Which is times
our final velocity

219
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,160
minus our initial velocity.

220
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,822
These are all vectors.

221
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:32,280
They're just positive, telling
us we're going to the right.

222
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,340
And we don't just multiply
the base times the height.

223
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,270
That would give us the area
of this entire rectangle.

224
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,690
We have to take it by half
because a triangle is only half

225
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,020
of that rectangle.

226
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,280
So times one half.

227
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,590

228
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,320
And so this is the area.

229
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,560
This is the purple area.

230
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,160
That's not purple.

231
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,810
This is the purple
area, right over here.

232
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,140
This is the area of this.

233
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,479
This is the area of that.

234
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,020
And let's simplify
this a little bit.

235
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,890
Let's factor out a delta t.

236
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,850
So if you factor
out a delta t, you

237
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,965
get delta t times, a
bunch of stuff, v sub i.

238
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:11,580
So your initial velocity.

239
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,780
We factored this out.

240
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,710
Plus this stuff.

241
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,070
Plus this thing right over here.

242
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,790
And we can distribute
the one half.

243
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,330
We factored the delta t's out.

244
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,910
And let's multiply the one half
times each of these things.

245
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,810
So it's going to be
plus, one half times v f,

246
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,670
times our final velocity.

247
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,040
That's not the right
color, let me actually

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
do it in the right color so
you understand what I'm doing.

249
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,750
So this is the one half.

250
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,870
So plus one half times
our final velocity.

251
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,640

252
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,845
Minus one half times
our initial velocity.

253
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:53,480

254
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,271
I want to do that in blue.

255
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,270
Sorry, I'm having trouble
changing colors today.

256
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,635
Minus one half times
our initial velocity.

257
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:03,572

258
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,030
And now what does
this simplify to?

259
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,450
We have something plus one
half times something else,

260
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,230
minus one half times
that original something.

261
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,490
So what is v i minus
one half times v i.

262
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,230
So anything minus
half of it, you're

263
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,070
just going to have a
positive half left.

264
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,490
So these two terms,
this term and this term

265
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,300
will simplify to one half v i.

266
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,980
One half the initial
velocity plus one half times

267
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,780
the final velocity.

268
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,480

269
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,730
And all of that is
being multiplied

270
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,740
by our change in time.

271
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,410
Or the time that has gone by.

272
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,359
And this tells us the distance.

273
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,650
The distance that we travelled.

274
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,050
Or another way to
think about it-- let's

275
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,090
factor out this one half.

276
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,200
You get distance is equal
to change in time, times--

277
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,930
factoring out the one
half-- v i plus v f.

278
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,260
No, that's not the right color.

279
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,150
v i plus v f.

280
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,160

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,220
So this is interesting.

282
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,020
The distance we traveled
is equal to one half

283
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,340
of the initial velocity
plus the final velocity.

284
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,350
So this is really--
if you just took,

285
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,330
this quantity right
over here is just

286
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,140
the arithmetic-- I always
have trouble saying that word.

287
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,829
It's the arithmetic mean
of these two numbers.

288
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,870
And so I'm going to define
this as something new.

289
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,920
I'm going to call this
the average velocity.

290
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,000
But we have to be very
careful with this.

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,130
This right here is
the average velocity.

292
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,830
But the only reason
why I can just

293
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,137
take the starting velocity and
the ending velocity and, adding

294
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,720
them together, and
then divide by two.

295
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,803
Essentially taking the
average of these two things

296
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:57,370
which would be
someplace over here.

297
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,220
And I take that as
the average velocity,

298
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,280
is because my
acceleration is constant.

299
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,771
Which is usually an assumption
in most introductory physics

300
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:06,270
classes.

301
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,770
But it's not always
the assumption.

302
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,090
But if you do have a constant
acceleration like this,

303
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,900
you can assume that
the average velocity

304
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,890
is going to be the average
of the initial velocity

305
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,647
and the final velocity.

306
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,980
If this was a curve or if the
acceleration was changing,

307
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,720
you could not do that.

308
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,430
But what's useful
about this-- is

309
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,270
if you want to figure out the
distance that was traveled

310
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,530
you just need to know
the initial velocity

311
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,350
and the final velocity.

312
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,980
Average the two, and
then multiply that

313
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,310
times the time that goes by.

314
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,210
So in this situation,
our final velocity

315
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,150
is 13 meters per second.

316
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,180
Our initial velocity was
five meters per second.

317
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,600
So you have 13 plus
5 is equal to 18.

318
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,230
You divide that by 2.

319
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,350
Your average velocity
is 9 meters per second,

320
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,480
if you take the
average of 13 and 5.

321
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,440
And then 9 meters per
second times 4 seconds

322
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,977
gives you 36 meters.

323
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,560
So hopefully that
doesn't confuse you.

324
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,200
I just want to show you
where some of these things

325
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,360
that you'll see in
your physics class,

326
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,693
some of these formulas, why
you shouldn't memorize them,

327
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,607
and they can all be deduced.

328
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:09,106

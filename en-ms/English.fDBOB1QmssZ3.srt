1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,362
Find the sum 3 and 1/8 plus
3/4 plus negative 2 and 1/6.

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:06,820
Let's just do the
first part first.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,240
It's pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,620
We have two positive numbers.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,190
Let me draw a number line.

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,219
So let me draw a number line.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,270
And I'll try to focus in.

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,300
So we're going to
start at 3 and 1/8.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,950
So let's make this 0.

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:28,020
So you have 1, 2, 3,
and then you have 4.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,440
3 and 1/8 is going to
be right about there.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,299
So let me just draw
its absolute value.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:40,710
So this 3 and 1/8 is going to
be 3 and 1/8 to the right of 0.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,430
So it's going to be exactly that
distance from 0 to the right.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,020
So this right here, the
length of this arrow,

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,194
you could view it as 3 and 1/8.

18
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,860
Now whenever I like to deal with
fractions, especially when they

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,040
have different denominators
and all of that,

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,330
I like to deal with them
as improper fractions.

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,080
It makes the addition
and the subtraction,

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,163
and, actually, the
multiplication and the division

23
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:01,770
a lot easier.

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,580
So 3 and 1/8 is the same
thing as 8 times 3 is 24,

25
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,220
plus 1 is 25 over 8.

26
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,010
So this is 25 over 8, which is
the same thing as 3 and 1/8.

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,770
Another way to think
about it, 3 is 24 over 8.

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,030
And then you add 1/8 to
that, so you get 25 over 8.

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,000
So this is our starting point.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now to that, we are
going to add 3/4.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We are going to add 3/4.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,610
So we're going to
move another 3/4.

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,080
We are going to
move another 3/4.

34
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,480
It's hard drawing these arrows.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,190
We're going to move
another 3/4 to the right.

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,060
So this right here,
the length of this

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,120
that we're moving
to the right is 3/4.

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,886
So plus 3/4.

39
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,010
Now where does this put us?

40
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,440
Well, both of these
are positive integers.

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
So we can just add them.

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,106
We just have to find
a like denominator.

43
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,910
So we have 25 over 8.

44
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,880
We have 25 over 8 plus 3/4.

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,150
That's the same thing as we need
to find a common denominator

46
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,650
here.

47
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,020
The common denominator, or
the least common multiple

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,250
of 4 and 8 is 8.

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,350
So it's going to be
something over 8.

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,560
To get from 4 to 8,
we multiply by 2.

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,680
So we have to multiply
3 by 2 as well.

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,820
So you get 6.

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,450
So 3/4 is the same thing as 6/8.

54
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,550
If we have 25/8 and
we're adding 6/8

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,990
to that, that gives
us 25 plus 6 is 31/8.

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,320
So this number right over here,
this number right over here,

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,205
is 31/8.

58
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:32,950

59
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,670
And it makes sense
because 32/8 would be 4.

60
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,050
So it should be a little
bit less than four.

61
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,400
So this number right
over here is 31/8.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,250
Or the length of this arrow, the
absolute value of that number,

63
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,020
is 31/8, a little
bit less than 4.

64
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,830
If you wanted to write that as a
mixed number, it would be what?

65
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,439
It would be 3 and 7/8.

66
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,730
So that's that right over here.

67
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,250
This is 31/8.

68
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,010
That's that part
right over there.

69
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,610
Now to that, we want to
add a negative 2 and 1/6.

70
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,700
So we're going to add
a negative number.

71
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,210
So think about what negative
2 and 1/6 is going to be like.

72
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,420
So let me do this in a
new color, do it in pink.

73
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,470
Negative 2 and 1/6.

74
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,054
So we're going to
subtract, or I guess

75
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,178
we're going to say we're
going to add a negative 1.

76
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,670
We're going to add a negative
2 and then a negative 1/6.

77
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,100
So let me draw.

78
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,785
So negative 2 and 1/6, we
could literally draw like this.

79
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:35,840

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,180
Negative 2 and 1/6 we
could draw with an arrow

81
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,180
that looks something like that.

82
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,655
So this is negative 2 and 1/6.

83
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,530
Now, there's a couple
ways to think about it.

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,170
You could just say,
hey, look, when

85
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,090
you add this arrow,
this thing that's

86
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,089
moving to the left-- we
could put it over here,

87
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,130
and you would get straight
to negative 2 and 1/6.

88
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,160
But we're adding this
negative 2 and 1/6.

89
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,760
It's the same thing
as subtracting

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,920
a positive 2 and 1/6.

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,030
We're moving 2 and
1/6 to the left.

92
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,520
And we're going to end up with
a number whose absolute value is

93
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,130
going to look
something like that.

94
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,921
And it's actually going
to be to the right.

95
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,095
So it's not going to only
be its absolute value.

96
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,470
Well, its absolute
value is going

97
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,119
to be the number since it's
going to be a positive number.

98
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,660
So let's just think
about what it is.

99
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,959
This value right
here, which is going

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,625
to be the answer to
our problem, is just

101
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:25,140
going to be the difference
of 31/8 and 2 and 1/6.

102
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,230
And it's the positive
difference because we're

103
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,560
dealing with a positive number.

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,100
So we just take 31/8.

105
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,790
And from that, we will
subtract 2 and 1/6.

106
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,730
So let's do this.

107
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:42,780
So this orange value is going
to be 31/8 minus 2 and 1/6.

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,600
So 2 and 1/6 is the
same thing as 6 times 2

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,500
is 12 plus 1 is 13.

110
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,651
Minus 13/6.

111
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,150
And this is equal
to, once again, we

112
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,740
need to get a common
denominator over here.

113
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,600
And it looks like 24 will be
the common denominator, 24.

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,040
And let me make it very clear.

115
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,920
This is the 31/8.

116
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,220
And this is the 2 and 1/6.

117
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,580
This right here
is the 2 and 1/6.

118
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,100
So 31/8 over 24.

119
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,930
You have to multiply by 3
to get to the 24 over here.

120
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,510
So we multiply by 3 on the 31.

121
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,650
That gives us 93.

122
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,210
And then to go from 6 to 24,
you have to multiply by 4.

123
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,050
We do that in another color.

124
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,880
You have to multiply
it by 4, so we

125
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,740
have to multiply by
4 up here as well.

126
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,870
So 4 times 13, let's see.

127
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,286
4 times 10 is 40.

128
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,180
4 times 3 is 12.

129
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
So that's 52.

130
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,970
So this is going to be equal
to 93 minus 52 over 24.

131
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,220
And that is-- so 93 minus 52.

132
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,620
3 minus 2 is 1.

133
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,010
9 minus 5 is 4.

134
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,729
So it is 41/24 and positive.

135
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,270
And you can see that here just
by looking at the number line.

136
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,450
This right here is 41 over 24.

137
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,500
And it should be a
little bit less than 2

138
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,940
because 2 would be 48 over 24.

139
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,340
So this would be 48 over 24.

140
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,750
And it makes sense that we're
a little bit less than that.

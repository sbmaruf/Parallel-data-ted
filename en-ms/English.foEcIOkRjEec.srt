00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,880
In the first video
on evolution, I

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,890
drew something that
I called an ape.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,562
And then I drew a tail on it.

5
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:09,020
And what I want to
do in this video

6
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,340
is clarify that that
was absolutely wrong.

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,700
Apes have no tails.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,890
And it's actually one of
the main distinguishing

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,670
characteristics of apes.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,240
There's obviously other primates
that also have no tails.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,660
But apes definitely
have no tails.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,070
And just to clarify,
there's kind

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,610
of two families within apes.

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,090
And their common names are the
lesser apes and the great apes.

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:40,010
And the lesser apes are
things like gibbons.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,720
And the great apes are
things like chimpanzees,

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,300
and gorillas, and
me, human beings.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,170
So these right here,
these are the great apes.

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,240

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,860
And clearly, this
great ape right here,

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,860
did not have a great
sense of style in 1994.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,400
And really didn't feel the
need to have a haircut.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,900

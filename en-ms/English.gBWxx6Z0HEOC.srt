1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,130
I think we're now ready to learn
a little bit about the

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,570
dark reactions.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,300
But just to remember where we
are in this whole scheme of

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,750
photosynthesis, photons came
in and excited electrons in

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,520
chlorophyll in the
light reactions.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,500
and as those photons went to
lower and lower energy

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,250
states-- we saw it over here
in the last video-- as they

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,860
went to lower and lower energy
states, and all of this was

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,130
going on in the thylacoid
membrane right over here.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,920
You can imagine-- Let me do
it in a different color.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,980
You can imagine it occurring
right here.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,620
As they went into lower and
lower energy states, two

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,359
things happened.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,470
One, the release of energy was
able to pump the hydrogens

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,640
across this membrane.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
And then when you had a high
concentration of hydrogens

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,380
here, those went back through
the ATP synthase and drove

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,350
that motor to produce ATP.

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,440
And then the final electron
acceptor, or hydrogen

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,840
acceptor, depending on how
you want to view it.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,540
The whole hydrogen atom
was NAD plus.

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,580
So the two byproducts, or the
two byproducts that we're

23
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:03,555
going to continue using in
photosynthesis from our light

24
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,540
cycle, from our light
reactions I guess.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,780
I shouldn't call it the light
cycle-- were-- I wrote it up

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,290
here-- ATP and NADPH.

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,040
And then the byproduct was that
we needed the electron to

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,950
replace that first
excited electron.

29
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,730
So we take it away from water.

30
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,740
And so we also produce oxygen,
which is a very valuable

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,420
byproduct of this reaction.

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,960
But now that we have this ATP
and this NADPH, we're ready to

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,690
proceed into the
dark reactions.

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,190
And I want to highlight again,
even though it's called the

35
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,280
dark reactions it doesn't mean
that it happens at night.

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,510
It actually happens at the same
time as light reactions.

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,970
It occurs while the
sun is out.

38
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,470
The reason why they call it
the dark reactions is that

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,860
they're light independent.

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,640
They don't require photons.

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,920
They only require ATP, NADPH,
and carbon dioxide.

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,660
So let's understand what's
going on here

43
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,350
a little bit better.

44
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,910
So let me go down to
where I have some

45
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,290
clean space down here.

46
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,740
So we had our light reactions.

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,189
And they produced-- I just
reviewed this-- produced some

48
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,870
ATP and produced
some and NADPH.

49
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,880
And now we're going to take some
carbon dioxide from the

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,130
atmosphere.

51
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,080
And all of this will go into
the-- I'll call it the light

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,170
independent reactions.

53
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,710
Because dark reactions
is misleading.

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:45,010
So the light independent
reactions, the actual

55
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,270
mechanism is called
the Calvin Cycle.

56
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,110
And that's what this video
is really about.

57
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:57,380
It goes into the Calvin Cycle
and out pops-- whether you

58
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,180
want to call it PGAL-- we talked
about it in the first

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,440
video-- or G3P.

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,350
This is glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

61
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,890
This is phosphoglyceraldehyde
They are the exact same

62
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,420
molecule, just different
names.

63
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,970
And you can imagine it as
a 3-carbon chain with a

64
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,260
phosphate group.

65
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,160
And then this can then be used
to build other carbohydrates.

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,640
You put two of these together
you can get a glucose.

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,950
You might remember in the first
stage of glycolysis, or

68
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,730
the first time we cut a glucose
molecule we ended up

69
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,490
with two phosphoglyceraldehyde
molecules.

70
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,970
Glucose has six carbons.

71
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,990
This has three.

72
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,350
Let's study the Calvin
Cycle in just a

73
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,120
little bit more detail.

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:51,420
So let's say exiting the light
reactions, let's say we have--

75
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,000
well let's start off with
six carbon dioxides.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,780
So this is independent of
the light reactions.

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,560
And I'll show you why I'm
using these numbers.

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,570
I don't have to use these
exact numbers.

79
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,450
So let's say I start
off with six CO2s.

80
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,760
And I could write a CO2 because
we really care about

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
what's happening
to the carbon.

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,320
We can just write it as a single
carbon that has two

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
oxygens on it, which
I could draw.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,150
But I'm not going to draw
them right now.

85
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,600
Because I want to really
show you what

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,090
happens to the carbons.

87
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,490
Maybe I should draw this
in this yellow.

88
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,920
Just to show you only
the carbons.

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,370
I'm not showing you the
oxygens on here.

90
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:30,170
And what happens is the CO2,
the six CO2s, essentially

91
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,240
react with-- and I'll talk a
little bit about this reaction

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,850
in a second-- they react with
six molecules-- and this is

93
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,640
going to look a little bit
strange to you-- of this

94
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,100
molecule, you could
call it RuBP.

95
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,630
That's short for ribulose
biphosphate.

96
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,000
Sometimes called ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,430
And the reason why it's called
that is because it's a

98
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,630
5-carbon molecule.

99
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,710
So, three, four five.

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,840
And it has a phosphate on
the 1 and 5 carbon.

101
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,830
So it's ribulose bisphosphate.

102
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:12,400
Or sometimes, ribulosee-1-- let
me write this-- that's the

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,910
first carbon.

104
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:16,456
5-bisphosphate.

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,850
We have two phosphates.

106
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,710
So that's ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

107
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,760
Fancy name, but it's just
a 5-carbon chain with 2

108
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,950
phosphates on it.

109
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,570
These two react together.

110
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,500
And this is a simplification.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,800
These two react together.

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,780
There's a lot more going on
here, but I want you to get

113
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,960
the big picture.

114
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:45,430
to form, 12 molecules of PGAL,
of phosphoglyceraldehyde or

115
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:53,340
glyceraldihyde 3-phosphate of
PGAL, which you can view as

116
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,000
a-- it has three carbons and
then it has a phosphate group.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,300
And just to make sure we're
accounting for our carbons

118
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,560
properly, let's think
about what happens.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,780
We have 12 of these guys.

120
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,520
You can think of it that
we have-- 12 times

121
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,510
3-- we have 36 carbons.

122
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,510
Now did we start with
36 carbons?

123
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,440
Well we have 6 times 5 carbons.

124
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,260
That's 30.

125
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,640
Plus another 6 here.

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,060
So, yes.

127
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,580
We have 36 carbons.

128
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,260
They react with each other
to form this PGAL.

129
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,690
The bonds or the electrons in
this molecule are in a higher

130
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,020
energy state than the electrons
in this molecule.

131
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,900
So we have to add energy
in order for

132
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,420
this reaction to happen.

133
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,480
This won't happen
spontaneously.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,620
And the energy for this
reaction, if we use the

135
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,160
numbers 6 and 6 here, the energy
from this reaction is

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,890
going to come from 12 ATPs-- you
could imagine 2 ATPs for

137
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,040
every carbon and every ribulose

138
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:02,990
bisphosphate; and 12 NADPHs.

139
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,900
I don't want to get you confused
with-- it's very

140
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,220
similar to NADH, but I don't
want to get you confused with

141
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,560
what goes on in respiration.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:17,100
And then these leave as 12 ADPs
plus 12 phosphate groups.

143
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:25,460
And then you're going to have
plus 12 NADP pluses.

144
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,970
And the reason why this is a
source of energy is because

145
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,420
the electrons in NADPH, or you
could say the hydrogen with

146
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,320
the electron in NADPH, is at
a higher energy state.

147
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,290
So as it goes to lower
energy state, it

148
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,680
helps drive a reaction.

149
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,360
And of course ATPs, when they
lose their phosphate groups,

150
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,370
those electrons are in a very
high energy state, they enter

151
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:45,552
a lower energy state, help drive
a reaction, help put

152
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,010
energy into a reaction.

153
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,630
So then we have these
12 PGALs.

154
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,150
Now the reason why it's called
a Calvin Cycle-- as you can

155
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,680
imagine-- we studied
the Kreb Cycle.

156
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,140
Cycles start reusing things.

157
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,960
The reason why it's called the
Calvin Cycle is because we do

158
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,570
reuse, actually, most
of these PGALs.

159
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:12,660
So of the 12 PGALs, we're going
to use 10 of them to--

160
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,400
let me actually do
it this way.

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,780
So we're going to
have 10 PGALs.

162
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,320
10 phosphoglyceraldehydes 10
PGALs we're going to use to

163
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,150
recreate the ribulose
bisphosphate.

164
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,440
And the counting works.

165
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,530
Because we have ten 3-carbon
molecules.

166
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,910
That's 30 carbons.

167
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,200
Then we have six 5-carbon
molecules.

168
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,310
30 carbons.

169
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,579
But this, once again, is
going to take energy.

170
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,520
This is going to take the
energy from six ATPs.

171
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,590
So you're going to have six ATPs
essentially losing their

172
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,260
phosphate group.

173
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,740
The electrons enter
lower energy

174
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,480
states, drive reactions.

175
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:54,662
And you're going to have six
ADPs plus six phosphate groups

176
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,000
that get released.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,590
And so you see it as a cycle.

178
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,050
But the question is, well
gee I used all of these.

179
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,250
What do I get out of it?

180
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,410
Well I only used 10
out of the 12.

181
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,900
So I have 2 PGALs left.

182
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,700
And these can then be used--
and the reason why I used 6

183
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,920
and 6 is so that
I get 12 here.

184
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,150
And I get 2 here.

185
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,790
And the reason why I have 2 here
is because 2 PGALs can be

186
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,900
used to make at glucose.

187
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,860
Which is a 6-carbon molecule.

188
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,010
It's formula, we've seen
it before, is C6H12O6.

189
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,140
But it's important to remember
that it doesn't have to just

190
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,660
be glucose.

191
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,770
It can then go off and generate
longer chained

192
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,400
carbohydrates and starches,
anything that

193
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,140
has a carbon backbone.

194
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,180
So this is it.

195
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,350
This is the dark reaction.

196
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,310
We were able to take the
byproducts of the light

197
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,130
reactions, the ATP and the
NADHs-- there's some more ATP

198
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,670
there-- and use it
to fix carbon.

199
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,700
This is called carbon
fixation.

200
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,060
When you take carbon in a
gaseous form and you put it

201
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,890
into a solid structure, that
is called carbon fixation.

202
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,170
So through this Calvin Cycle we
were able to fix carbon and

203
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,200
the energy comes from these
molecules generated from the

204
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
light reaction.

205
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,720
And of course, it's called a
cycle because we generate

206
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
these PGALs, some of them can
be used to actually produce

207
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,580
glucose or other carbohydrates
while most of them continue on

208
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,250
to be recycled into ribulose
bisphosphate, which once again

209
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,920
reacts with carbon dioxide.

210
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,970
And then you get this cycle
happening over and over again.

211
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,060
Now we said it doesn't
happen in a vacuum.

212
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,040
Actually if you want to know the
actual location where this

213
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,510
is occurring, this is all
occurring in the stroma.

214
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,770
And the fluid inside the
chloroplast but outside of

215
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,950
your thylacoid.

216
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,130
So in your stroma, this is where
your light independent

217
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,850
reactions are actually
occurring.

218
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,640
And it's not just happening with
the ADP and the NADPH.

219
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,600
There's actually a fairly decent
sized enzyme or protein

220
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,560
that's facilitating it.

221
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,790
That's allowing the carbon
dioxide to bond at certain

222
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,900
points and the ribulose
bisphosphate and the ATP to

223
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,440
react at certain points, to
essentially drive these two

224
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,380
guys to react together.

225
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,560
And that enzyme, sometimes it's
called RuBisCo, I'll tell

226
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,870
you why it's called RuBisCo.

227
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,000
So this is RuBisCo.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,690
So rub-- let me get the
capitalization right--

229
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,950
ribulose bisphosphate rub--
bis-- co-- carboxylase.

230
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,040
And this is what
it looks like.

231
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,490
So it's a pretty big protein
enzyme molecule.

232
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,710
You can imagine that you have
your ribulose bisphosphate

233
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,070
bonding at one point.

234
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,690
You have your carbon dioxide
bonding at another point.

235
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,120
I don't know what
points they are.

236
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,550
ATP bonds at another point.

237
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,640
It reacts.

238
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,400
That makes this thing twist and
turn in certain ways to

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,590
make the ribulose bisphosphate
react with the carbon dioxide.

240
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,460
NADPH might be reacting
at other parts.

241
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,040
And that's what facilitates
this entire Calvin Cycle.

242
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,600
And you might-- I told you over
here-- that this R U B P,

243
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,410
this is ribulose-1
5-bisphophate.

244
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,800
This RuBisCo, this is short for
ribulose-1 5-bisphophate

245
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,290
carboxylase.

246
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,880
I won't write it all out;
you could look it up.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,260
But it's just telling you, it's
an enzyme that's used to

248
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,040
react carbon and ribulose-1
5-bisphophate.

249
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,900
But now we're done.

250
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,750
We're done with photosynthesis.

251
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,070
We were able to start off with
photons and water to produce

252
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,100
ATP and NADPH because we had
those excited electrons, we

253
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,610
had the whole chemiosmosis to
drive the-- that allowed the

254
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,840
ATP synthase to produce ATP.

255
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,660
NADPH was the final
electron acceptor.

256
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,020
These are then used as the fuel
in the Calvin Cycle, in

257
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,990
the dark reaction.

258
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,820
Which is badly named, it should
be called the light

259
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,650
independent reaction.

260
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,270
Because it actually does
happen in the light.

261
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,070
You take your fuel from the
light reactions with some

262
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,840
carbon dioxide and you can fix
it using your-- I like to call

263
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,090
it-- the RuBisCo enzyme
in the Calvin Cycle.

264
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,210
And you end up with your
phosphoglyceraldehyde which

265
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,000
could also be called your
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,860
which can then be used to
generate glucose, which we all

267
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,400
use to eat and fuel
our bodies.

268
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,780
Or we learn in cellular
respiration, that can then be

269
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,550
converted into ATP
when we need it.

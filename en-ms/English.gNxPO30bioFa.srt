00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:19,251
Welcome to the presentation on level two addition. Well I think we should get started with some problems, and hopefully as we work through them, you'll have an understanding of how to do these types of problems. Let's see... Let me make sure the pen tool is correct. Okay.

2
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:28,102
Let's say I had 11 plus 4.

3
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:34,965
So at first you'd say hey, Sal, you know, 11 plus 4, 
I don't know how to add two-digit numbers yet.
Well there's a couple of ways we can think about this.
First I'll show you how all you have to know is 
how to add one-digit numbers and you can use something called 
carrying to solve the whole problem.
And then we'll actually try to visually represent it to show you 
how you could actually do this type of problem in your head as well.

4
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:35,465
you'll have an understanding of how to do these types of problems. Let's see...

5
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:35,965
Let me make sure the pen tool is correct. Okay.

6
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:36,465
Let's say I had 11+4.

7
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:36,965
So at first you'd say hey, Sal, you know,  11+4,

8
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:37,465
I don't know how to add 2-digit numbers yet.

9
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:37,965
Well there's a couple of ways we can think about this.

10
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,720
First I'll show you how all you have to know is

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,348
how to add 1-digit numbers

12
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,248
and you can use something called carrying to solve the whole problem.

13
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:45,610
And then we'll actually try to visually represent it

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,900
to show you how you could actually do this type of problem

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,640
in your head as well.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,168
So what you do with these types of problems

17
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:55,902
is you first look at the right-most digit on the 11.

18
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,510
We call this the one's place, right?

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,795
Because this one is one, and we call this the ten's place.

20
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:02,349
I know I'm going to confuse you a lot,

21
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,155
but that's  just so how everything looks--

22
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:06,844
that's so everything looks easier later on.

23
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,780
So you look at this ones place, you say there's a 1 there.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,558
You take that one and you add it to the number right below it.

25
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:13,850
So 1+4=5.

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,270
You knew that, right?

27
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,289
Right? You know that 1+4=5.

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,680
And that's all I did here.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,730
I just said this 1 + this 4 = 5.

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,300
Now I go to this one.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,120
This 1+ -- well there's nothing here

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,532
other than a plus sign and that's not a number.

33
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:33,030
So this one plus nothing is one.

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,560
So we put a one here.

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,862
And we get 11+4=15.

36
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:44,590
And just so you know that this system actually works.

37
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,305
Let's actually draw it out in a couple of different ways

38
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,620
Just to give you the intuition of 11+4.

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,983
So if I had 11 balls -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

40
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:58,910
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,035
That's 11, right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

42
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,701
Alright, I should do it like they do on Sesame Street,

43
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,782
(singing) "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-"

44
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:12,505
Oh actually I think I messed up. It's 11.

45
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,045
Anyway! It's early. I'm being a little ridiculous.

46
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,677
Okay! So that's 11 and we're going to add 4 to it.

47
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:22,740
So 1, 2, 3, 4,

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,199
So now all we have to do is

49
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,906
count how many total circles or balls we have now.

50
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:33,831
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

51
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:39,585
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

52
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:41,961
15, and I don't recommend that you do this every time you do a problem

53
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,846
because it'll take you a long time.

54
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,793
But hey, if you ever get confused,

55
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:48,273
it's better to take along time than to get it wrong.

56
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:50,650
Let's think about another way of representing this,

57
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,977
because I think different visual approaches

58
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:54,480
appeal in different ways to different people.

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,210
Let's draw a number line.

60
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,010
I don't know if you've seen a number line before

61
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,930
but you're going to see it now.

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,690
And a number line, all I do is

63
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,795
I draw out all the numbers in order.

64
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:13,895
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -- I'm doing them small

65
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:24,204
so I know I can get to 15. 6 -- 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

66
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:36,280
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and so on.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,641
And these arrows mean that

68
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:41,180
the numbers keep going in both directions.

69
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,523
I know this is a little early for you to learn this.

70
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,690
But actually the numbers can actually keep

71
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,029
going to the left below zero as well.

72
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,641
I'll leave you to think about that.

73
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,990
But anyway, so let's go back to this problem.

74
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,626
So we have 11, so let me circle 11 --

75
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:52,857
let me see where 11 is on the number line.

76
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,056
11 is here, right?

77
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,605
This is 11.

78
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,289
And we're adding 4.

79
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:03,020
So when you add, that means we're gonna increase 11 by 4.

80
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,443
So that when you increase we're going to go up the number line, right?

81
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,841
Or we're going to go the right on the number line,

82
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,241
because the numbers are getting bigger.

83
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:15,300
So we'd go 1, 2, 3, 4 -- bam!

84
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,910
We're at fifteen.

85
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,684
Once again, this takes a long time. But if you ever get confused

86
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,450
or you forget what one plus four is,

87
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,682
although I don't think you should,

88
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,414
then you could just do it this way.

89
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:32,762
Let's do some maybe harder problems now.

90
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:42,869
Let's do, let's do 28+7.

91
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:47,352
Okay. 8+7 -- I'll tell you, frankly, even to this day,

92
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,622
I sometimes get confused with 8+7.

93
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,500
So let's-- If you know the answer

94
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,342
then you already know how to do this problem,

95
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,935
you can just write whatever the answer is right here.

96
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,170
But let's draw it out on the number line,

97
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,989
because I think a little bit of more basic addition practices

98
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:02,458
isn't unwarranted at this point.

99
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,520
So we could do it with the number line again.

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,444
8+7.

101
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:11,570
And this time I'm not going to start at 0, I'll start at like 5,

102
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,440
because, you know, if you keep going you'll get to 0 eventually.

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:28,862
So let's see you get  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

104
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:33,146
16, 17, 18, and so on

105
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,290
And it'll keep going to a hundred and a thousand

106
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,480
and a million billion trillion.

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
So what are we doing?

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,450
We start at eight because this is 8+7.

109
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,405
We want to figure out what 8+7 is.

110
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:46,518
So we start at 8.

111
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:47,575
And we're going to add 7 to it.

112
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,340
Let me change colors.

113
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:57,907
So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

114
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,426
Oh, that 15 shows up again.

115
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,944
So 8+7 is equal to 15.

116
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,269
And over time as you do practice,

117
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,240
I think you'll memorize these that 8+7=15 or
whatever,

118
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,710
6+7=13 or any of these.

119
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,205
But in the interim it actually doesn't hurt to do this number line

120
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:16,108
because you actually are visualizing what's happening.

121
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,060
And you can do it with the circles as well.

122
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,590
So we know 8+7=15.

123
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,280
So this is a new thing you're going to learn right now.

124
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,260
You don't write the whole 15 down here.

125
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:29,010
You write the 5 -- you write this 5 right here.

126
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,300
And then that 1, you carry the 1.

127
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,170
You put it up there.

128
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,485
I think in a future presentation I'll explain why this works

129
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,840
and maybe you might even kind of have an intuition

130
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,862
because the 1 is in the ten’s place,

131
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,320
and this is the ten‘s place.

132
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,810
I don't want to confuse you.

133
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,870
So you have that 1 and now you add it to the 2,

134
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,670
and you get 35.

135
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,060
Right? Because 1+2=3, right?

136
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,050
So you're done.

137
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,090
35.

138
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,329
And you might ask, well,

139
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,720
does that make sense that 28+7=35?

140
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,000
And there's a couple of ways I'd like to think about this.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Well, 8+7 we know is 15, right?

142
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,132
And I don't know how comfortable

143
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,723
you are with higher numbers.

144
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:18,500
But 8+7 -- so look at this pattern.

145
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,640
8+7=15.

146
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,360
18+7 -- you're probably saying,

147
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,720
Sal, where are you getting the 18 from, but take my word for it.

148
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,380
18+7=25.

149
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,853
28+7=35 which is the one that we just did.

150
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:38,710
That is a check mark.

151
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,890
And if you kept going, you said 38+7,

152
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,380
that actually equals 45.

153
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,860
So you might see a little pattern here,

154
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,910
and then you can just sit and think about this for a little bit if you like.

155
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,617
Maybe you pause the video.

156
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,350
Another way you could think about this, if you still don't believe me, is

157
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,732
you say, okay, if I have 28, if I add 1, I get 29.

158
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:01,970
If I add 2, I get 30. If I add 3, I get 31.

159
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,410
If I add 4, I get 32.

160
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,425
If I add 5, I get 33.

161
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,550
If I add 6, I get 34.

162
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,110
And if I add 7, I get 35 again.

163
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,150
Right, all I did is I kept saying oh, if I had one more

164
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,800
I'll get larger a little bit -- the number a little bit larger.

165
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,999
Let's do some more problems,

166
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:21,940
and I think we'll do a couple more.

167
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,726
Let's do it a little faster

168
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:26,110
because you might get what we're doing here now.

169
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,580
Let's do a hard one.

170
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,300
Let's do 99+9.

171
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
So what's 9+9?

172
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,670
So if you don't know what it is, you can work it out

173
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,720
either using the number line or drawing the circles.

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,990
And, you know that's a fair way to do it,

175
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,070
although you should eventually kind of know it.

176
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:50,724
9+9 it turns out is 18. 9+9 is equal to 18...so 9+9...

177
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:55,320
and you put the 8 down here and you carry the 1.

178
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,810
And now you just say 1+9.

179
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,150
Well you know what 1+9 is.

180
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,480
1+ 9=10.

181
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,640
And so there's nowhere to carry this 1,

182
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,460
so you write the whole thing down here.

183
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,280
So 99+9=108.

184
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,820
Let's do one more problem.

185
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,450
Let's say 56+7.

186
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,780
Well what's six plus seven.

187
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,070
Well 6+7=13, right?

188
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,650
If you get confused, draw out everything again.

189
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,980
And then you get 1+5.

190
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,570
1+5=6.

191
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,960
63.

192
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,770
And you might want to give yourself a bunch of problems

193
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,580
and I think you're also now, if you understand what we did,

194
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,060
ready to try the level 2 addition problems.

195
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,580
Have fun!

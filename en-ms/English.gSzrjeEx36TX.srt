Shakespeare's Sonnets by William Shakespeare

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,599
Sonnet 1

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,590
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,390
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:28,049
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,550
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,510
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

8
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:49,750
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:58,640
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

10
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:01,769
Sonnet 2

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,740
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,940
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:

13
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,729
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;

14
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:27,009
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.

15
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:32,989
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine

16
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,840
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
Proving his beauty by succession thine!

17
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:49,879
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

18
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,139
Sonnet 3

19
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,180
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another;

20
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:07,669
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.

21
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,570
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?

22
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,280
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Of his self-love to stop posterity?

23
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:26,209
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;

24
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:34,330
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.

25
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:43,210
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
Die single and thine image dies with thee.

26
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,520
Sonnet 4

27
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,550
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?

28
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,770
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
And being frank she lends to those are free:

29
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,580
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give?

30
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,470
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?

31
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:15,139
For having traffic with thy self alone,
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:

32
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:21,119
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?

33
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:30,289
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.

34
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,550
Sonnet 5

35
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,580
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,

36
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,250
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;

37
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:52,649
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;

38
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:02,200
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:

39
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:09,429
Then were not summer's distillation left,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,

40
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,510
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:

41
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:25,359
But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,740
Sonnet 6

43
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,140
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:

44
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,450
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.

45
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,390
That use is not forbidden usury,
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;

46
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,470
That's for thy self to breed another thee,
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;

47
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,770
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:

48
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,840
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
Leaving thee living in posterity?

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,960
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.

50
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,230
Sonnet 7

51
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,030
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye

52
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,810
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;

53
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,580
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,170
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:

55
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:44,760
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,

56
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,910
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
From his low tract, and look another way:

57
00:05:51,909 --> 00:06:01,609
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.

58
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,420
Sonnet 8

59
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:12,060
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:

60
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,090
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?

61
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,170
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,

62
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:29,650
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.

63
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,950
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;

64
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:43,080
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:

65
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:50,920
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'

66
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,360
Sonnet 9

67
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,390
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
That thou consum'st thy self in single life?

68
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:07,710
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;

69
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,230
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,

70
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,900
When every private widow well may keep
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:

71
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,240
Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;

72
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,840
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it.

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,480
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

74
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,230
Sonnet 10

75
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,230
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Who for thy self art so unprovident.

76
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:53,500
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
But that thou none lov'st is most evident:

77
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:59,429
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,

78
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,970
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.

79
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:11,449
O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?

80
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:18,410
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:

81
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:28,509
Make thee another self for love of me,
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.

82
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,160
Sonnet 11

83
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,879
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;

84
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:45,159
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,

85
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,940
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
Without this folly, age, and cold decay:

86
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,250
If all were minded so, the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away.

87
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,630
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:

88
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:11,950
Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:

89
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:22,240
She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.

90
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,640
Sonnet 12

91
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,570
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;

92
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,540
When I behold the violet past prime,
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;

93
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,570
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,

94
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:52,560
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,

95
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,640
Then of thy beauty do I question make,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,

96
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:07,660
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow;

97
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:17,010
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

98
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,320
Sonnet 13

99
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:27,200
O! that you were your self; but, love you are
No longer yours, than you your self here live:

100
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,320
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And your sweet semblance to some other give:

101
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,750
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination; then you were

102
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:45,400
Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.

103
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,650
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Which husbandry in honour might uphold,

104
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,200
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?

105
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:07,470
O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
You had a father: let your son say so.

106
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,560
Sonnet 14

107
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,350
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
And yet methinks I have astronomy,

108
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,710
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;

109
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,010
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,

110
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,470
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:

111
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,350
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
And constant stars in them I read such art

112
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,710
As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';

113
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:53,800
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'

114
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,619
Sonnet 15

115
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,650
When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,

116
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:09,140
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;

117
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,390
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,

118
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,600
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;

119
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:29,089
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,

120
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:35,950
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night,

121
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:44,590
And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

122
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,920
Sonnet 16

123
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,779
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?

124
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,680
And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?

125
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,179
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,

126
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:11,619
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:

127
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,780
So should the lines of life that life repair,
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,

128
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,240
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.

129
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:33,799
To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

130
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,049
Sonnet 17

131
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,799
Who will believe my verse in time to come,
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?

132
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,859
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.

133
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:54,649
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,

134
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:01,260
The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'

135
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:08,980
So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,

136
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:15,729
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
And stretched metre of an antique song:

137
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:24,809
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.

138
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,790
Sonnet 18

139
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,769
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

140
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:39,510
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:

141
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,020
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,

142
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,730
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:

143
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:58,649
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,

144
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:04,820
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,

145
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:15,310
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

146
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,829
Sonnet 19

147
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,750
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;

148
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,490
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;

149
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:36,409
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,

150
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:42,889
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:

151
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:50,280
O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;

152
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,350
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.

153
00:15:55,349 --> 00:16:04,379
Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
My love shall in my verse ever live young.

154
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,220
Sonnet 20

155
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:13,139
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;

156
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:19,040
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:

157
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:25,059
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;

158
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:33,260
A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.

159
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:39,610
And for a woman wert thou first created;
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,

160
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:46,669
And by addition me of thee defeated,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.

161
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:57,149
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

162
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,790
Sonnet 21

163
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,829
So is it not with me as with that Muse,
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,

164
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,990
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,

165
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:18,180
Making a couplement of proud compare'
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,

166
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:25,230
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.

167
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:33,660
O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
And then believe me, my love is as fair

168
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:41,410
As any mother's child, though not so bright
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:

169
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:50,110
Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.

170
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,050
Sonnet 22

171
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,880
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
So long as youth and thou are of one date;

172
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,550
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
Then look I death my days should expiate.

173
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,650
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,

174
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,310
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
How can I then be elder than thou art?

175
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:22,960
O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;

176
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,400
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.

177
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:37,750
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.

178
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,990
Sonnet 23

179
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,500
As an unperfect actor on the stage,
Who with his fear is put beside his part,

180
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:53,190
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;

181
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,200
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,

182
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,110
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.

183
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,860
O! let my looks be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,

184
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:18,040
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.

185
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:27,290
O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.

186
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,330
Sonnet 24

187
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,560
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;

188
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,470
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
And perspective it is best painter's art.

189
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,580
For through the painter must you see his skill,
To find where your true image pictur'd lies,

190
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:53,010
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.

191
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:58,870
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me

192
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:06,320
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;

193
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:15,020
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

194
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,600
Sonnet 25

195
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,910
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,

196
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:30,540
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.

197
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:36,040
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,

198
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,130
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.

199
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,960
The painful warrior famoused for fight,
After a thousand victories once foil'd,

200
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,220
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:

201
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:03,110
Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.

202
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,970
Sonnet 26

203
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,180
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,

204
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,500
To thee I send this written embassage,
To witness duty, not to show my wit:

205
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,640
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,

206
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,190
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:

207
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,450
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,

208
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,450
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:

209
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:50,850
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

210
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,530
Sonnet 27

211
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,480
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;

212
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,450
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:

213
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:12,070
For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,

214
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:18,510
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:

215
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,720
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,

216
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,240
Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.

217
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:41,160
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.

218
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,950
Sonnet 28

219
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,930
How can I then return in happy plight,
That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?

220
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,980
When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
But day by night and night by day oppress'd,

221
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,600
And each, though enemies to either's reign,
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,

222
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,600
The one by toil, the other to complain
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.

223
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,160
I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:

224
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,270
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.

225
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:26,040
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.

226
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,980
Sonnet 29

227
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,390
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state,

228
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,310
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,

229
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,160
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,

230
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,150
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;

231
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:02,000
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,

232
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,800
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;

233
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:16,390
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

234
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,960
Sonnet 30

235
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:26,310
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,

236
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:34,080
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:

237
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,710
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,

238
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:49,080
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:

239
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,280
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er

240
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:02,240
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.

241
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:11,080
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.

242
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,549
Sonnet 31

243
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:23,200
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
Which I by lacking have supposed dead;

244
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:32,100
And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
And all those friends which I thought buried.

245
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:38,240
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,

246
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,150
As interest of the dead, which now appear
But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!

247
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:51,330
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,

248
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:58,010
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
That due of many now is thine alone:

249
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:08,760
Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.

250
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,750
Sonnet 32

251
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,310
If thou survive my well-contented day,
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover

252
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:27,060
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,

253
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,550
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,

254
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:39,310
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
Exceeded by the height of happier men.

255
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:47,470
O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,

256
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:54,070
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:

257
00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:04,610
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,120
Sonnet 33

259
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:14,810
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,

260
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:22,330
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;

261
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:28,350
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face,

262
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:37,020
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:

263
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,140
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;

264
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:53,700
But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.

265
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:03,270
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

266
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,760
Sonnet 34

267
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:12,040
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,

268
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,800
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?

269
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,950
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,

270
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:30,250
For no man well of such a salve can speak,
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:

271
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,800
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:

272
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,960
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.

273
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:53,580
Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

274
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,260
Sonnet 35

275
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:03,860
No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:

276
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:11,240
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.

277
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,810
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,

278
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:24,120
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;

279
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,490
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--

280
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,770
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
Such civil war is in my love and hate,

281
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:45,840
That I an accessary needs must be,
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

282
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,240
Sonnet 36

283
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,860
Let me confess that we two must be twain,
Although our undivided loves are one:

284
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:03,420
So shall those blots that do with me remain,
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.

285
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,720
In our two loves there is but one respect,
Though in our lives a separable spite,

286
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,540
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.

287
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,870
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,

288
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:27,380
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:

289
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:37,590
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

290
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,250
Sonnet 37

291
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,810
As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth,

292
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:54,570
So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;

293
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:01,470
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
Or any of these all, or all, or more,

294
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:08,030
Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
I make my love engrafted, to this store:

295
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:15,760
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give

296
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:23,010
That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
And by a part of all thy glory live.

297
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:33,240
Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

298
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,770
Sonnet 38

299
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:42,090
How can my muse want subject to invent,
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse

300
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,770
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?

301
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:53,940
O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;

302
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,230
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
When thou thy self dost give invention light?

303
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:07,450
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;

304
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,290
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.

305
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:24,040
If my slight muse do please these curious days,
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

306
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,780
Sonnet 39

307
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:34,300
O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
When thou art all the better part of me?

308
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:41,190
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?

309
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,840
Even for this, let us divided live,
And our dear love lose name of single one,

310
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,710
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.

311
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,810
O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,

312
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:06,210
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,

313
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:15,070
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
By praising him here who doth hence remain.

314
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,960
Sonnet 40

315
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:25,140
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?

316
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:32,680
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.

317
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,570
Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;

318
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,400
But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.

319
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,690
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:

320
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:56,490
And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.

321
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:07,630
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

322
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,730
Sonnet 41

323
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:16,920
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,

324
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:24,160
Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
For still temptation follows where thou art.

325
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:31,400
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;

326
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,130
And when a woman woos, what woman's son
Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?

327
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:44,000
Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,

328
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,070
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--

329
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:59,049
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

330
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,280
Sonnet 42

331
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,980
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;

332
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,210
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.

333
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:21,380
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;

334
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:28,590
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.

335
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:35,440
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;

336
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:43,080
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:

337
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:53,760
But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

338
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,110
Sonnet 43

339
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:03,840
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
For all the day they view things unrespected;

340
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,000
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.

341
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,620
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
How would thy shadow's form form happy show

342
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:23,640
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!

343
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,240
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day,

344
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:36,670
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!

345
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:46,900
All days are nights to see till I see thee,
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

346
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,090
Sonnet 44

347
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,610
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
Injurious distance should not stop my way;

348
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:01,250
For then despite of space I would be brought,
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.

349
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,980
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;

350
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,120
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
As soon as think the place where he would be.

351
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:19,360
But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,

352
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:25,800
But that so much of earth and water wrought,
I must attend time's leisure with my moan;

353
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:34,560
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.

354
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,690
Sonnet 45

355
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,860
The other two, slight air, and purging fire
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;

356
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:50,950
The first my thought, the other my desire,
These present-absent with swift motion slide.

357
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:56,030
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee,

358
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:04,100
My life, being made of four, with two alone
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;

359
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:10,090
Until life's composition be recur'd
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,

360
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:16,310
Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:

361
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:28,350
This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
I send them back again, and straight grow sad.

362
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,480
Sonnet 46

363
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:37,590
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;

364
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:44,750
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.

365
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:51,050
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--
A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--

366
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:57,910
But the defendant doth that plea deny,
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.

367
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:04,010
To side this title is impannelled
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;

368
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:10,860
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:

369
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:21,190
As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.

370
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,480
Sonnet 47

371
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,340
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
And each doth good turns now unto the other:

372
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,880
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,

373
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,920
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;

374
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,410
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:

375
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:55,360
So, either by thy picture or my love,
Thy self away, art present still with me;

376
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,890
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
And I am still with them, and they with thee;

377
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:10,150
Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.

378
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,670
Sonnet 48

379
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:19,100
How careful was I when I took my way,
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,

380
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,840
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!

381
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,440
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,

382
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.

383
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,970
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,

384
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,790
Within the gentle closure of my breast,
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;

385
00:40:50,790 --> 00:41:00,660
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.

386
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,410
Sonnet 49

387
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,480
Against that time, if ever that time come,
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,

388
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,790
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;

389
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:24,960
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,

390
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,950
When love, converted from the thing it was,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;

391
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:39,220
Against that time do I ensconce me here,
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,

392
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:46,230
And this my hand, against my self uprear,
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:

393
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:55,690
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
Since why to love I can allege no cause.

394
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,710
Sonnet 50

395
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:04,830
How heavy do I journey on the way,
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,

396
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:12,290
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'

397
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:19,340
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,

398
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,190
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:

399
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:32,540
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,

400
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,110
Which heavily he answers with a groan,
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;

401
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:48,190
For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.

402
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,150
Sonnet 51

403
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:59,610
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:

404
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:06,290
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
Till I return, of posting is no need.

405
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:12,910
O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
When swift extremity can seem but slow?

406
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:19,120
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
In winged speed no motion shall I know,

407
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:25,760
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,

408
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,550
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--

409
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:41,710
'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'

410
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,710
Sonnet 52

411
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,820
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,

412
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:56,610
The which he will not every hour survey,
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.

413
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:02,170
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
Since, seldom coming in that long year set,

414
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:08,130
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.

415
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:13,960
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,

416
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:21,300
To make some special instant special-blest,
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.

417
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:29,550
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.

418
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,470
Sonnet 53

419
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,850
What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?

420
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:45,840
Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
And you but one, can every shadow lend.

421
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,450
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you;

422
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:56,900
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:

423
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,840
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,

424
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,880
The other as your bounty doth appear;
And you in every blessed shape we know.

425
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:15,760
In all external grace you have some part,
But you like none, none you, for constant heart.

426
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:18,199
Sonnet 54

427
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:26,180
O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.

428
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:32,760
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.

429
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,800
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses.

430
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,850
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:

431
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:51,340
But, for their virtue only is their show,
They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;

432
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:59,590
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:

433
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:09,170
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

434
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,130
Sonnet 55

435
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:17,440
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;

436
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:25,630
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.

437
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:31,740
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,

438
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:38,380
Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.

439
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,900
'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room

440
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,480
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.

441
00:46:50,480 --> 00:47:00,270
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

442
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,310
Sonnet 56

443
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:09,000
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,

444
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,840
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
To-morrow sharpened in his former might:

445
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:21,310
So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,

446
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:27,220
To-morrow see again, and do not kill
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.

447
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:33,160
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new

448
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:39,590
Come daily to the banks, that when they see
Return of love, more blest may be the view;

449
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:49,680
Or call it winter, which being full of care,
Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

450
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,920
Sonnet 57

451
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,090
Being your slave what should I do but tend,
Upon the hours, and times of your desire?

452
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:03,690
I have no precious time at all to spend;
Nor services to do, till you require.

453
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:09,660
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,

454
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,340
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
When you have bid your servant once adieu;

455
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:21,170
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,

456
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:30,010
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Save, where you are, how happy you make those.

457
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:39,280
So true a fool is love, that in your will,
Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.

458
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,290
Sonnet 58

459
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:48,120
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,

460
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:54,100
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!

461
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:59,320
O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;

462
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:05,220
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
Without accusing you of injury.

463
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:10,110
Be where you list, your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilage your time

464
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:16,290
To what you will; to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.

465
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:26,320
I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

466
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,750
Sonnet 59

467
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,920
If there be nothing new, but that which is
Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,

468
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,260
Which labouring for invention bear amiss
The second burthen of a former child!

469
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,390
O! that record could with a backward look,
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,

470
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:50,020
Show me your image in some antique book,
Since mind at first in character was done!

471
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:55,039
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame;

472
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,340
Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
Or whether revolution be the same.

473
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:08,440
O! sure I am the wits of former days,
To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

474
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:11,819
Sonnet 60

475
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:18,400
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
So do our minutes hasten to their end;

476
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:25,050
Each changing place with that which goes before,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.

477
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:31,040
Nativity, once in the main of light,
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,

478
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:38,510
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.

479
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:44,470
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,

480
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:51,150
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:

481
00:50:51,140 --> 00:51:01,590
And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

482
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:06,270
Sonnet 61

483
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:11,169
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?

484
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:17,540
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?

485
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:22,990
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
So far from home into my deeds to pry,

486
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:28,190
To find out shames and idle hours in me,
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?

487
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:35,390
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:

488
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:41,630
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:

489
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:52,290
For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
From me far off, with others all too near.

490
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,630
Sonnet 62

491
00:51:54,390 --> 00:52:01,070
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul, and all my every part;

492
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:06,470
And for this sin there is no remedy,
It is so grounded inward in my heart.

493
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:12,940
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
No shape so true, no truth of such account;

494
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:19,820
And for myself mine own worth do define,
As I all other in all worths surmount.

495
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:25,590
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,

496
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:32,260
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
Self so self-loving were iniquity.

497
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:41,920
'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

498
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,900
Sonnet 63

499
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,890
Against my love shall be as I am now,
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;

500
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:56,810
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn

501
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:02,710
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
And all those beauties whereof now he's king

502
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:09,450
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;

503
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:14,210
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding age's cruel knife,

504
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:20,590
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:

505
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:30,000
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
And they shall live, and he in them still green.

506
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,010
Sonnet 64

507
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,200
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;

508
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:47,200
When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;

509
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,660
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,

510
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:58,160
And the firm soil win of the watery main,
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;

511
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,980
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded, to decay;

512
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:11,070
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
That Time will come and take my love away.

513
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:19,820
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

514
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,530
Sonnet 65

515
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:29,580
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
But sad mortality o'ersways their power,

516
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,020
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?

517
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:41,369
O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
Against the wrackful siege of battering days,

518
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:48,100
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?

519
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:54,750
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?

520
00:54:54,750 --> 00:55:01,010
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?

521
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:10,589
O! none, unless this miracle have might,
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

522
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,440
Sonnet 66

523
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:19,050
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
As to behold desert a beggar born,

524
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:24,420
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,

525
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,750
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,

526
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:34,490
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
And strength by limping sway disabled

527
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:40,680
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,

528
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:46,420
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill:

529
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:54,990
Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

530
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,560
Sonnet 67

531
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:04,200
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
And with his presence grace impiety,

532
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:09,560
That sin by him advantage should achieve,
And lace itself with his society?

533
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,870
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
And steel dead seeming of his living hue?

534
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:21,090
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?

535
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:26,650
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?

536
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:32,630
For she hath no exchequer now but his,
And proud of many, lives upon his gains.

537
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:41,470
O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
In days long since, before these last so bad.

538
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,000
Sonnet 68

539
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:52,460
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,

540
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:59,050
Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;

541
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:03,470
Before the golden tresses of the dead,
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,

542
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:09,220
To live a second life on second head;
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:

543
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:16,030
In him those holy antique hours are seen,
Without all ornament, itself and true,

544
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:21,460
Making no summer of another's green,
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;

545
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:30,190
And him as for a map doth Nature store,
To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

546
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:33,240
Sonnet 69

547
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:38,830
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;

548
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:46,480
All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.

549
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,930
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,

550
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:58,980
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.

551
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:05,380
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;

552
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:13,840
Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:

553
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:22,420
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

554
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:25,319
Sonnet 70

555
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:30,780
That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;

556
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,650
The ornament of beauty is suspect,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.

557
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:42,340
So thou be good, slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;

558
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:49,540
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.

559
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:55,840
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;

560
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:02,200
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,

561
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:11,850
If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

562
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,850
Sonnet 71

563
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,400
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell

564
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:27,760
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:

565
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:33,869
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it, for I love you so,

566
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:39,450
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
If thinking on me then should make you woe.

567
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:45,780
O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,

568
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:52,570
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
But let your love even with my life decay;

569
00:59:52,570 --> 01:00:00,690
Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
And mock you with me after I am gone.

570
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,320
Sonnet 72

571
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:10,560
O! lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me, that you should love

572
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:17,970
After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;

573
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:23,390
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
To do more for me than mine own desert,

574
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:28,970
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:

575
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:35,830
O! lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue,

576
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:42,660
My name be buried where my body is,
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.

577
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:51,290
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

578
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,700
Sonnet 73

579
01:00:54,450 --> 01:01:01,850
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang

580
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:10,090
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

581
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:15,650
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west;

582
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:23,190
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.

583
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:28,440
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,

584
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:35,390
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.

585
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:46,460
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

586
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,960
Sonnet 74

587
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:54,480
But be contented: when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away,

588
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,600
My life hath in this line some interest,
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.

589
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:05,780
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee:

590
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:13,270
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:

591
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:19,129
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
The prey of worms, my body being dead;

592
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:24,980
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
Too base of thee to be remembered.

593
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:35,620
The worth of that is that which it contains,
And that is this, and this with thee remains.

594
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,250
Sonnet 75

595
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:45,709
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;

596
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:52,300
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.

597
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:58,670
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;

598
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:06,170
Now counting best to be with you alone,
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:

599
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:11,770
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
And by and by clean starved for a look;

600
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:17,279
Possessing or pursuing no delight,
Save what is had, or must from you be took.

601
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:26,610
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

602
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:30,410
Sonnet 76

603
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,350
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
So far from variation or quick change?

604
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:42,880
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?

605
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,180
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
And keep invention in a noted weed,

606
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:53,820
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?

607
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:00,400
O! know sweet love I always write of you,
And you and love are still my argument;

608
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,900
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Spending again what is already spent:

609
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:15,030
For as the sun is daily new and old,
So is my love still telling what is told.

610
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,630
Sonnet 77

611
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:24,880
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;

612
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:31,650
These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.

613
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:36,510
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;

614
01:04:36,509 --> 01:04:43,249
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
Time's thievish progress to eternity.

615
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:49,429
Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find

616
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:55,380
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.

617
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:02,760
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

618
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,300
Sonnet 78

619
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:10,550
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
And found such fair assistance in my verse

620
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:16,400
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse.

621
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:22,470
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,

622
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:27,500
Have added feathers to the learned's wing
And given grace a double majesty.

623
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:34,339
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:

624
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:40,860
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;

625
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:47,370
But thou art all my art, and dost advance
As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

626
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,020
Sonnet 79

627
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:57,729
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;

628
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:03,730
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.

629
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:09,350
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;

630
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:15,110
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.

631
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:20,240
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,

632
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:26,900
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.

633
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:34,310
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

634
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:36,600
Sonnet 80

635
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:44,120
O! how I faint when I of you do write,
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,

636
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:50,780
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!

637
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:56,760
But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,

638
01:06:56,759 --> 01:07:03,499
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.

639
01:07:03,499 --> 01:07:09,829
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;

640
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:16,840
Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
He of tall building, and of goodly pride:

641
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:26,140
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

642
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,600
Sonnet 81

643
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:35,740
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;

644
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:43,020
From hence your memory death cannot take,
Although in me each part will be forgotten.

645
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:50,779
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:

646
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:58,610
The earth can yield me but a common grave,
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.

647
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:05,180
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;

648
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:13,520
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
When all the breathers of this world are dead;

649
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:23,729
You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

650
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,290
Sonnet 82

651
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:32,060
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook

652
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:38,370
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.

653
01:08:38,369 --> 01:08:44,309
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;

654
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:51,510
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.

655
01:08:51,509 --> 01:08:57,559
And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,

656
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:06,170
Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;

657
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:15,690
And their gross painting might be better us'd
Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.

658
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:18,690
Sonnet 83

659
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:24,460
I never saw that you did painting need,
And therefore to your fair no painting set;

660
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:30,820
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
That barren tender of a poet's debt:

661
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:36,740
And therefore have I slept in your report,
That you yourself, being extant, well might show

662
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:43,999
How far a modern quill doth come too short,
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.

663
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,520
This silence for my sin you did impute,
Which shall be most my glory being dumb;

664
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:57,310
For I impair not beauty being mute,
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.

665
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:06,780
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise.

666
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,070
Sonnet 84

667
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:17,380
Who is it that says most, which can say more,
Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?

668
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:23,510
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew.

669
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:29,400
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory;

670
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:37,140
But he that writes of you, if he can tell
That you are you, so dignifies his story,

671
01:10:37,139 --> 01:10:43,699
Let him but copy what in you is writ,
Not making worse what nature made so clear,

672
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:50,630
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
Making his style admired every where.

673
01:10:50,630 --> 01:11:00,350
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

674
01:11:00,349 --> 01:11:03,689
Sonnet 85

675
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,730
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
While comments of your praise richly compil'd,

676
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:16,060
Reserve their character with golden quill,
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.

677
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:23,290
I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'

678
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:30,070
To every hymn that able spirit affords,
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.

679
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:37,090
Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
And to the most of praise add something more;

680
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:44,710
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.

681
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:54,090
Then others, for the breath of words respect,
Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

682
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:57,720
Sonnet 86

683
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:04,320
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,

684
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,990
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?

685
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:17,030
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?

686
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:23,010
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.

687
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:28,700
He, nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,

688
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:35,220
As victors of my silence cannot boast;
I was not sick of any fear from thence:

689
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:44,200
But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

690
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,800
Sonnet 87

691
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:54,010
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,

692
01:12:54,010 --> 01:13:01,360
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
My bonds in thee are all determinate.

693
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:07,950
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
And for that riches where is my deserving?

694
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:15,670
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving.

695
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:23,400
Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;

696
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:30,820
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
Comes home again, on better judgement making.

697
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:40,990
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

698
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:44,360
Sonnet 88

699
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:49,990
When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,

700
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:57,010
Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.

701
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:02,650
With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
Upon thy part I can set down a story

702
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:09,900
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:

703
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,820
And I by this will be a gainer too;
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,

704
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:21,200
The injuries that to myself I do,
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.

705
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:30,120
Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

706
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:33,499
Sonnet 89

707
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:38,860
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
And I will comment upon that offence:

708
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:44,760
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
Against thy reasons making no defence.

709
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:50,650
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
To set a form upon desired change,

710
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:57,970
As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;

711
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:04,110
Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,

712
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:10,710
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.

713
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:19,810
For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

714
01:15:19,809 --> 01:15:22,859
Sonnet 90

715
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:30,100
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,

716
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:35,770
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
And do not drop in for an after-loss:

717
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:41,610
Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;

718
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:46,890
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.

719
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,740
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
When other petty griefs have done their spite,

720
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:58,970
But in the onset come: so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune's might;

721
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:09,280
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.

722
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,050
Sonnet 91

723
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:20,390
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,

724
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:27,359
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;

725
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:34,370
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:

726
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:41,469
But these particulars are not my measure,
All these I better in one general best.

727
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:48,240
Thy love is better than high birth to me,
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,

728
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:55,600
Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:

729
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:05,080
Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

730
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,920
Sonnet 92

731
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:13,740
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
For term of life thou art assured mine;

732
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:20,040
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
For it depends upon that love of thine.

733
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:25,610
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
When in the least of them my life hath end.

734
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:30,880
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend:

735
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,860
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.

736
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:44,000
O! what a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!

737
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:52,470
But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

738
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:55,420
Sonnet 93

739
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:01,420
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
Like a deceived husband; so love's face

740
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:08,920
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:

741
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:15,280
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.

742
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:22,170
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.

743
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:28,440
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;

744
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:36,630
Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.

745
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:44,210
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

746
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:46,540
Sonnet 94

747
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:54,880
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,

748
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:02,910
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;

749
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:09,560
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
And husband nature's riches from expense;

750
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:16,770
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others, but stewards of their excellence.

751
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:22,410
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself, it only live and die,

752
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:29,010
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:

753
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:40,240
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

754
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,070
Sonnet 95

755
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:50,280
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,

756
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:57,670
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.

757
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:04,150
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,

758
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:10,840
Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.

759
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:17,400
O! what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee,

760
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:24,680
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!

761
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:35,340
Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.

762
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,420
Sonnet 96

763
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:46,020
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;

764
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:53,740
Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.

765
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:59,110
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,

766
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:05,960
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.

767
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:13,150
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!

768
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:19,330
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!

769
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:29,830
But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

770
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:33,420
Sonnet 97

771
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:40,760
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!

772
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:49,200
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
What old December's bareness everywhere!

773
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:56,600
And yet this time removed was summer's time;
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,

774
01:21:56,599 --> 01:22:03,989
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:

775
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:10,380
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;

776
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:17,250
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
And, thou away, the very birds are mute:

777
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:27,480
Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

778
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:30,710
Sonnet 98

779
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:36,630
From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,

780
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:43,490
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.

781
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:49,870
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,

782
01:22:49,869 --> 01:22:57,009
Could make me any summer's story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:

783
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:02,050
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;

784
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:10,090
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.

785
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:19,990
Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
As with your shadow I with these did play.

786
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:21,670
Sonnet 99

787
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:28,900
The forward violet thus did I chide:
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,

788
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:34,570
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells

789
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:41,340
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
The lily I condemned for thy hand,

790
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:47,460
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,

791
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:56,020
One blushing shame, another white despair;
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,

792
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:02,210
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth

793
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:07,190
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.

794
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:16,020
More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

795
01:24:16,019 --> 01:24:19,419
Sonnet 100

796
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:24,990
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?

797
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:33,010
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?

798
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:38,550
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;

799
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:45,240
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.

800
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:52,530
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;

801
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:59,450
If any, be a satire to decay,
And make time's spoils despised every where.

802
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:08,810
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.

803
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:11,790
Sonnet 101

804
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:19,970
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?

805
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:25,420
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.

806
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:32,550
Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;

807
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:39,020
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
But best is best, if never intermix'd'?

808
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:45,060
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee

809
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:51,120
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.

810
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:59,989
Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now.

811
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:03,260
Sonnet 102

812
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:10,420
My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
I love not less, though less the show appear;

813
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:18,070
That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.

814
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:24,050
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
When I was wont to greet it with my lays;

815
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:30,420
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:

816
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:35,680
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,

817
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:43,570
But that wild music burthens every bough,
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.

818
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:52,400
Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
Because I would not dull you with my song.

819
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,840
Sonnet 103

820
01:26:54,590 --> 01:27:02,150
Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
That having such a scope to show her pride,

821
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:08,150
The argument, all bare, is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside!

822
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:13,880
O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
Look in your glass, and there appears a face

823
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:20,880
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.

824
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:27,020
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
To mar the subject that before was well?

825
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:32,720
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;

826
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:41,870
And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

827
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:44,910
Sonnet 104

828
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:51,530
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,

829
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:58,310
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,

830
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:03,750
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
In process of the seasons have I seen,

831
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:12,450
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.

832
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:18,880
Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;

833
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:26,910
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:

834
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:36,030
For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.

835
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:39,610
Sonnet 105

836
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,820
Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
Nor my beloved as an idol show,

837
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:51,180
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.

838
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:58,200
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;

839
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:03,470
Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.

840
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:11,720
'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,
'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;

841
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:17,580
And in this change is my invention spent,
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.

842
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:27,840
Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

843

Sonnet 106

844
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:36,570
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,

845
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:42,540
And beauty making beautiful old rime,
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,

846
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:49,380
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,

847
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:56,910
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now.

848
01:29:56,910 --> 01:30:03,340
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;

849
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:09,020
And for they looked but with divining eyes,
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:

850
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:18,840
For we, which now behold these present days,
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,300
Sonnet 107

852
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:28,200
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,

853
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:34,940
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.

854
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:41,100
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;

855
01:30:41,099 --> 01:30:48,159
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.

856
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:54,540
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,

857
01:30:54,540 --> 01:31:01,920
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:

858
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:11,980
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

859
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,610
Sonnet 108

860
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:21,269
What's in the brain, that ink may character,
Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?

861
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:27,410
What's new to speak, what now to register,
That may express my love, or thy dear merit?

862
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:34,930
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
I must each day say o'er the very same;

863
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:42,310
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.

864
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:47,910
So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,

865
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:54,240
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
But makes antiquity for aye his page;

866
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:02,340
Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
Where time and outward form would show it dead.

867
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:04,950
Sonnet 109

868
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:12,660
O! never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,

869
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:18,290
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:

870
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:24,090
That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
Like him that travels, I return again;

871
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:30,300
Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
So that myself bring water for my stain.

872
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:35,390
Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,

873
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:41,349
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;

874
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:49,059
For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

875
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,810
Sonnet 110

876
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:58,980
Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
And made my self a motley to the view,

877
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:06,500
Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
Made old offences of affections new;

878
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:12,680
Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
Askance and strangely; but, by all above,

879
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:19,110
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.

880
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:24,890
Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
Mine appetite I never more will grind

881
01:33:24,889 --> 01:33:31,809
On newer proof, to try an older friend,
A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.

882
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:40,950
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

883
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:43,940
Sonnet 111

884
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:51,850
O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,

885
01:33:51,849 --> 01:33:58,139
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds.

886
01:33:58,139 --> 01:34:04,019
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd

887
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:10,990
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;

888
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:16,680
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;

889
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:22,100
No bitterness that I will bitter think,
Nor double penance, to correct correction.

890
01:34:22,099 --> 01:34:30,779
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.

891
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,190
Sonnet 112

892
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:40,370
Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;

893
01:34:40,369 --> 01:34:47,759
For what care I who calls me well or ill,
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?

894
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:54,620
You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue;

895
01:34:54,619 --> 01:35:01,339
None else to me, nor I to none alive,
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.

896
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:07,010
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense

897
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:14,240
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:

898
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:22,940
You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
That all the world besides methinks are dead.

899
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,160
Sonnet 113

900
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:31,780
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
And that which governs me to go about

901
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:38,040
Doth part his function and is partly blind,
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;

902
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:44,450
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:

903
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:50,720
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;

904
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:57,290
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,

905
01:35:57,290 --> 01:36:04,690
The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.

906
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:13,870
Incapable of more, replete with you,
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.

907
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:17,489
Sonnet 114

908
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:23,750
Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?

909
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:29,240
Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
And that your love taught it this alchemy,

910
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:35,310
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,

911
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:40,940
Creating every bad a perfect best,
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?

912
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:48,330
O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:

913
01:36:48,329 --> 01:36:54,899
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:

914
01:36:54,900 --> 01:37:02,860
If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.

915
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,950
Sonnet 115

916
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:12,560
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:

917
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:19,160
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.

918
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:25,980
But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,

919
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:33,970
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;

920
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:41,150
Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'

921
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:47,870
When I was certain o'er incertainty,
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?

922
01:37:47,869 --> 01:37:58,329
Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
To give full growth to that which still doth grow?

923
01:37:58,329 --> 01:38:01,799
Sonnet 116

924
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:06,790
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love

925
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:11,790
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:

926
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:18,720
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;

927
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:25,600
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.

928
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:32,279
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;

929
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:39,280
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.

930
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:48,360
If this be error and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

931
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,860
Sonnet 117

932
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:56,930
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,

933
01:38:56,930 --> 01:39:02,850
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;

934
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:09,049
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;

935
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:14,740
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.

936
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:22,120
Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
And on just proof surmise, accumulate;

937
01:39:22,119 --> 01:39:28,599
Bring me within the level of your frown,
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;

938
01:39:28,599 --> 01:39:39,279
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love.

939
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,780
Sonnet 118

940
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:48,400
Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
With eager compounds we our palate urge;

941
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:55,550
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;

942
01:39:55,550 --> 01:40:02,240
Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;

943
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:09,540
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.

944
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:15,720
Thus policy in love, to anticipate
The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,

945
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:22,480
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;

946
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:32,200
But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

947
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,380
Sonnet 119

948
01:40:35,139 --> 01:40:41,259
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,

949
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:48,130
Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
Still losing when I saw myself to win!

950
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:53,690
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!

951
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:59,250
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
In the distraction of this madding fever!

952
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:05,820
O benefit of ill! now I find true
That better is, by evil still made better;

953
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:13,220
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.

954
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:22,220
So I return rebuk'd to my content,
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.

955
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:23,770
Sonnet 120

956
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:30,900
That you were once unkind befriends me now,
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,

957
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:37,330
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.

958
01:41:37,329 --> 01:41:43,989
For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;

959
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:50,060
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.

960
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:57,470
O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,

961
01:41:57,470 --> 01:42:04,850
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!

962
01:42:04,849 --> 01:42:14,229
But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

963
01:42:14,229 --> 01:42:16,979
Sonnet 121

964
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:25,290
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
When not to be receives reproach of being;

965
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:31,620
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd
Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:

966
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:37,079
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood?

967
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:43,499
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?

968
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:50,300
No, I am that I am, and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own:

969
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:57,100
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;

970
01:42:57,099 --> 01:43:05,529
Unless this general evil they maintain,
All men are bad and in their badness reign.

971
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:08,660
Sonnet 122

972
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:14,430
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
Full character'd with lasting memory,

973
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:20,350
Which shall above that idle rank remain,
Beyond all date; even to eternity:

974
01:43:20,349 --> 01:43:25,379
Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist;

975
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:32,230
Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.

976
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:38,530
That poor retention could not so much hold,
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;

977
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:44,490
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
To trust those tables that receive thee more:

978
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:50,710
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me.

979
01:43:50,709 --> 01:43:52,819
Sonnet 123

980
01:43:52,570 --> 01:44:01,180
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramids built up with newer might

981
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:07,810
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
They are but dressings of a former sight.

982
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:13,800
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;

983
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,880
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told.

984
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:25,030
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
Not wondering at the present nor the past,

985
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:32,380
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by thy continual haste.

986
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:42,740
This I do vow and this shall ever be;
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

987
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:50,079
Sonnet 124

988
01:44:49,829 --> 01:44:57,069
If my dear love were but the child of state,
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,

989
01:44:57,070 --> 01:45:05,230
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.

990
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:11,230
No, it was builded far from accident;
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls

991
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:17,910
Under the blow of thralled discontent,
Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:

992
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:23,630
It fears not policy, that heretic,
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,

993
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:30,620
But all alone stands hugely politic,
That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.

994
01:45:30,619 --> 01:45:37,899
To this I witness call the fools of time,
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

995
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,790
Sonnet 125

996
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:47,390
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
With my extern the outward honouring,

997
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:53,539
Or laid great bases for eternity,
Which proves more short than waste or ruining?

998
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:59,290
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent

999
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:05,990
For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?

1000
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:13,540
No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,

1001
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:20,410
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
But mutual render, only me for thee.

1002
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:28,830
Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

1003
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:30,860
Sonnet 126

1004
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:40,280
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;

1005
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:47,080
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.

1006
01:46:47,079 --> 01:46:53,119
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,

1007
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:59,909
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.

1008
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:06,470
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:

1009
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:15,690
Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
And her quietus is to render thee.

1010
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:19,420
Sonnet 127

1011
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:26,060
In the old age black was not counted fair,
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;

1012
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:33,240
But now is black beauty's successive heir,
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:

1013
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:40,020
For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,

1014
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:48,070
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.

1015
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:55,220
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem

1016
01:47:55,220 --> 01:48:03,310
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:

1017
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:12,060
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
That every tongue says beauty should look so.

1018
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,970
Sonnet 128

1019
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:20,740
How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds

1020
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:26,510
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,

1021
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:33,700
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,

1022
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:41,740
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!

1023
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:47,060
To be so tickled, they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips,

1024
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:53,670
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.

1025
01:48:53,670 --> 01:49:03,640
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

1026
01:49:03,639 --> 01:49:07,139
Sonnet 129

1027
01:49:06,889 --> 01:49:13,429
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action: and till action, lust

1028
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:22,220
Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;

1029
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:28,160
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,

1030
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:34,350
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
On purpose laid to make the taker mad:

1031
01:49:34,349 --> 01:49:40,779
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;

1032
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:49,570
A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.

1033
01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:59,610
All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

1034
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:02,880
Sonnet 130

1035
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:09,130
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red, than her lips red:

1036
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:17,350
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.

1037
01:50:17,349 --> 01:50:24,089
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;

1038
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:31,070
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

1039
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:36,630
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound:

1040
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:43,220
I grant I never saw a goddess go,--
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:

1041
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:53,200
And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
As any she belied with false compare.

1042
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:57,130
Sonnet 131

1043
01:50:56,889 --> 01:51:03,019
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;

1044
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:10,460
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.

1045
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:17,430
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;

1046
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:23,870
To say they err I dare not be so bold,
Although I swear it to myself alone.

1047
01:51:23,869 --> 01:51:29,849
And to be sure that is not false I swear,
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,

1048
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:36,249
One on another's neck, do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.

1049
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:44,290
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

1050
01:51:44,290 --> 01:51:45,970
Sonnet 132

1051
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:54,390
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,

1052
01:51:54,389 --> 01:52:00,499
Have put on black and loving mourners be,
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.

1053
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:06,580
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,

1054
01:52:06,579 --> 01:52:12,119
Nor that full star that ushers in the even,
Doth half that glory to the sober west,

1055
01:52:12,119 --> 01:52:18,899
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
O! let it then as well beseem thy heart

1056
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:25,160
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
And suit thy pity like in every part.

1057
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:34,730
Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

Sonnet 133

1059
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:43,610
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!

1060
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:50,470
Is't not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?

1061
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:56,550
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:

1062
01:52:56,550 --> 01:53:03,520
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:

1063
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:10,790
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;

1064
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:17,150
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:

1065
01:53:17,150 --> 01:53:25,940
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.

1066

Sonnet 134

1067
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:36,560
So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will,

1068
01:53:36,559 --> 01:53:41,719
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:

1069
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:48,390
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
For thou art covetous, and he is kind;

1070
01:53:48,389 --> 01:53:55,159
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.

1071
01:53:55,160 --> 01:54:00,890
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,

1072
01:54:00,889 --> 01:54:08,279
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.

1073
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:17,740
Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.

Sonnet 135

1075
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:28,270
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;

1076
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:34,330
More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,
To thy sweet will making addition thus.

1077
01:54:34,329 --> 01:54:40,369
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?

1078
01:54:40,369 --> 01:54:46,289
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?

1079
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:52,410
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
And in abundance addeth to his store;

1080
01:54:52,410 --> 01:54:59,530
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
One will of mine, to make thy large will more.

1081
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:10,810
Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;
Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

Sonnet 136

1083
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:19,769
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',

1084
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:26,880
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.

1085
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:33,310
'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.

1086
01:55:33,309 --> 01:55:38,599
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckon'd none:

1087
01:55:38,599 --> 01:55:45,039
Then in the number let me pass untold,
Though in thy store's account I one must be;

1088
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:51,490
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:

1089
01:55:51,490 --> 01:56:01,880
Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.'

Sonnet 137

1091
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:11,000
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
That they behold, and see not what they see?

1092
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:17,350
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.

1093
01:56:17,349 --> 01:56:23,119
If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,

1094
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:29,139
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?

1095
01:56:29,139 --> 01:56:35,039
Why should my heart think that a several plot,
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?

1096
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:41,360
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?

1097
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:52,200
In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

Sonnet 138

1099
01:56:55,849 --> 01:57:02,299
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her though I know she lies,

1100
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:07,830
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.

1101
01:57:07,829 --> 01:57:13,819
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,

1102
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:21,130
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:

1103
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:26,890
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?

1104
01:57:26,889 --> 01:57:35,069
O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love, loves not to have years told:

1105
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:44,620
Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.

Sonnet 139

1107
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:54,830
O! call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;

1108
01:57:54,829 --> 01:58:01,399
Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:
Use power with power, and slay me not by art,

1109
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:07,590
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:

1110
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:14,190
What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?

1111
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:19,370
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;

1112
01:58:19,369 --> 01:58:25,749
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:

1113
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:34,840
Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.

Sonnet 140

1115
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:46,030
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;

1116
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:52,620
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.

1117
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:58,849
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;--

1118
01:58:58,849 --> 01:59:05,189
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
No news but health from their physicians know;--

1119
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:13,040
For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee;

1120
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:21,160
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.

1121
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:31,380
That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

Sonnet 141

1123
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:42,599
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;

1124
01:59:42,599 --> 01:59:49,649
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.

1125
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:55,450
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,

1126
01:59:55,450 --> 02:00:02,040
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:

1127
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:08,390
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,

1128
02:00:08,389 --> 02:00:16,599
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:

1129
02:00:16,599 --> 02:00:26,099
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

1130
02:00:26,099 --> 02:00:29,849
Sonnet 142

1131
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:36,409
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:

1132
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:42,000
O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;

1133
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,740
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments

1134
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:54,180
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.

1135
02:00:54,180 --> 02:01:00,340
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:

1136
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:06,820
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.

1137
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:13,960
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
By self-example mayst thou be denied!

1138
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,430
Sonnet 143

1139
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:23,280
Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,

1140
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:28,820
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;

1141
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:35,450
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent

1142
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:41,820
To follow that which flies before her face,
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;

1143
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:49,430
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;

1144
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:56,500
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;

1145
02:01:56,500 --> 02:02:03,740
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

1146
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:05,220
Sonnet 144

1147
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:14,760
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:

1148
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:22,120
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.

1149
02:02:22,119 --> 02:02:28,559
To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
Tempteth my better angel from my side,

1150
02:02:28,559 --> 02:02:35,599
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.

1151
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:41,619
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;

1152
02:02:41,619 --> 02:02:49,059
But being both from me, both to each friend,
I guess one angel in another's hell:

1153
02:02:49,059 --> 02:02:59,319
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

1154
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,080
Sonnet 145

1155
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:09,050
Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',

1156
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:14,210
To me that languish'd for her sake:
But when she saw my woeful state,

1157
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:18,740
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet

1158
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:23,990
Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
And taught it thus anew to greet;

1159
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:29,020
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
That followed it as gentle day,

1160
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:33,850
Doth follow night, who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away.

1161
02:03:33,849 --> 02:03:41,699
'I hate', from hate away she threw,
And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.

1162
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:43,810
Sonnet 146

1163
02:03:43,559 --> 02:03:52,729
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
My sinful earth these rebel powers array,

1164
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:59,990
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?

1165
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:06,390
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?

1166
02:04:06,389 --> 02:04:12,969
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?

1167
02:04:12,970 --> 02:04:20,330
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;

1168
02:04:20,329 --> 02:04:28,739
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Within be fed, without be rich no more:

1169
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:38,850
So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

1170
02:04:38,849 --> 02:04:42,529
Sonnet 147

1171
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:48,870
My love is as a fever longing still,
For that which longer nurseth the disease;

1172
02:04:48,869 --> 02:04:54,569
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.

1173
02:04:54,570 --> 02:05:00,110
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,

1174
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:07,010
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.

1175
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:13,070
Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;

1176
02:05:13,070 --> 02:05:19,730
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
At random from the truth vainly express'd;

1177
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:28,780
For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

1178
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,850
Sonnet 148

1179
02:05:30,599 --> 02:05:39,539
O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight;

1180
02:05:39,539 --> 02:05:45,039
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That censures falsely what they see aright?

1181
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:51,699
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
What means the world to say it is not so?

1182
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:58,280
If it be not, then love doth well denote
Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,

1183
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:03,910
How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
That is so vexed with watching and with tears?

1184
02:06:03,910 --> 02:06:10,030
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.

1185
02:06:10,030 --> 02:06:21,850
O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

1186
02:06:21,849 --> 02:06:24,869
Sonnet 149

1187
02:06:24,619 --> 02:06:31,199
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
When I against myself with thee partake?

1188
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:37,460
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?

1189
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:42,970
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,

1190
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:49,080
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan?

1191
02:06:49,079 --> 02:06:54,469
What merit do I in my self respect,
That is so proud thy service to despise,

1192
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:59,670
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?

1193
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:09,260
But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

1194
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:11,580
Sonnet 150

1195
02:07:11,329 --> 02:07:18,739
O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
With insufficiency my heart to sway?

1196
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:25,100
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?

1197
02:07:25,099 --> 02:07:29,769
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
That in the very refuse of thy deeds

1198
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:37,020
There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?

1199
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:42,510
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?

1200
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:48,650
O! though I love what others do abhor,
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:

1201
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:56,530
If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

1202
02:07:56,530 --> 02:07:59,740
Sonnet 151

1203
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:05,620
Love is too young to know what conscience is,
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?

1204
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:12,169
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:

1205
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:18,430
For, thou betraying me, I do betray
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;

1206
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:24,950
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,

1207
02:08:24,950 --> 02:08:31,250
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,

1208
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:37,670
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.

1209
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:46,550
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

1210
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:49,850
Sonnet 152

1211
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:56,219
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;

1212
02:08:56,220 --> 02:09:04,080
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
In vowing new hate after new love bearing:

1213
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:10,699
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;

1214
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:17,340
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
And all my honest faith in thee is lost:

1215
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:23,800
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;

1216
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:30,660
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
Or made them swear against the thing they see;

1217
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:39,730
For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

1218
02:09:39,729 --> 02:09:42,409
Sonnet 153

1219
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:49,640
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,

1220
02:09:49,639 --> 02:09:55,869
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;

1221
02:09:55,869 --> 02:10:01,349
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,

1222
02:10:01,349 --> 02:10:07,299
And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.

1223
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:14,780
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;

1224
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:21,540
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,

1225
02:10:21,539 --> 02:10:31,199
But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

1226
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:34,410
Sonnet 154

1227
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,670
The little Love-god lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,

1228
02:10:39,670 --> 02:10:45,650
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand

1229
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:51,640
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;

1230
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:58,119
And so the general of hot desire
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.

1231
02:10:58,119 --> 02:11:03,869
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,

1232
02:11:03,869 --> 02:11:10,089
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,

1233
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:20,720
Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

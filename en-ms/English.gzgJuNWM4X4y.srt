1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's review a little bit
about what we know so

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,820
far about subtraction.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,210
So if I say 5 minus 3,
what does that mean?

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,060
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,804
I could have 5-- let's
say I had 5 berries.

6
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:21,930
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,520
So I could have 5 berries, and
when I say minus 3 you're

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,220
subtracting 3 from it.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,360
I can view that as saying
I'm going to take away

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,740
3 of these berries.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,220
So if I take away that berry,
that berry, and that berry.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,110
So I took away 1, 2, 3 berries.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,220
How many berries
do I have left?

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,130
Well the only berries I have
left are right here-- 1, 2.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,750
So I have 2 berries
left just like that.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,060
Now the other way, the other
way that I could visualize or

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,710
think about 5 minus 3,
I'll do it over here.

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,250
5 minus 3-- is to think
about what the difference

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,670
between 5 and 3 is.

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,610
So let me draw this.

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,280
So let's say I have 5 berries.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,560
And let's say that
you have 3 berries.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,600
Here's a slightly
different color.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,960
You have 3 berries.

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,110
So another way to think about
5 minus 3 is how many more

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,980
berries do I have
than you have?

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,500
And if you look right here,
well, you see, this berry

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,110
is another-- you have
also one berry there.

30
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,040
We both have one berry there,
we both have one berry there.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,970
But I've got 1, 2 berries
that you don't have.

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,200
So once again, I have 2 more
berries than you have.

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,220
Now we can also think of
this from the number

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,070
line point of view.

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,300
So let me draw a number
line just like that.

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,270
It's my number line.

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,850
We've learned on the
addition videos we can

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,620
keep going off forever.

39
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,220
And actually, we could even go
to the left of 0 and go into

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,160
negative numbers, which
we'll see in future videos.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,720
But I'll start at 0.

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:02,500
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--
I'll just go up to 7.

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,330
So if we do 5 minus 3, if we
view 3 as being taken away from

44
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,890
5, 5 minus 3 means start at 5.

45
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,890
If I did 5 plus 3 I would jump
3 spots to the right because

46
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,940
that's increasing the
number of things I have.

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,330
But since I'm subtracting 3,
I want to decrease by 3.

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:29,010
So I decrease by 1, 2, 3 and
I get to 2 just like that.

49
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,770
Now if we visualize it from
this point of view, let me

50
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,160
draw another number line.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,820
I want to show you.

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,280
I mean this is, I'm taking away
3 and here I'm saying, how

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,910
many more is 5 than 3?

54
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,690
Even though they're the exact
same answer, but there are two

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,940
different ways to
think about it.

56
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,480
Let me draw a number
line here again.

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,845
Let me draw the
same number line.

58
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:57,627
I have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

59
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,330
So if I were to plot where 5
is on this number line, so

60
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,770
this is the 5 right there.

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,750
I'll put a little pink
square around it.

62
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,490
5 is right there.

63
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,720
Now 3, let me do 3 in
this yellow color.

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,110
3 is right here on
the number line.

65
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,830
So in this way of thinking
about 5 minus 3 you're saying,

66
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,630
what is the difference--
let me write that down.

67
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:36,794
Here we're saying, what is the
difference between 5 and 3?

68
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:39,024
And to figure out the
difference you actually have to

69
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:43,130
say, how much do you have to
add to 3 to get to 5?

70
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,200
So the difference here, how
different is 5 than 3?

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,380
Well you have to go up 1
and then up 2 to get to 5.

72
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,430
So the difference between 5,
which is all the way over here,

73
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:04,520
and 3, which is just that
far, is 2, just like that.

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
That right there is 2.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,250
Let me draw that
in another box.

76
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,270
So that's 2 right here.

77
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,770
I want to make this difference
between subtraction and

78
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,060
difference-- I want to make it
at least reasonably clear to

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,600
you because these are two
different ways of viewing

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,340
subtraction, but it ends up
being the exact same operation.

81
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,650
You're going to get the same
answer regardless of which

82
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,530
way you think about it.

83
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,760
Now, I could view-- let me
do different numbers now.

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,550
Let me do 7 minus 4.

85
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,030
So I could view this as,
maybe I have a 7 foot

86
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,209
long piece of wood.

87
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,942
Maybe I have a 7 foot long piece of wood.

88
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,552
It's 7 feet long.

89
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:43,710
If I put a ruler up against
it I would have 0,

90
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,690
So I have a 7 foot
long piece of wood.

92
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,930
And then I could saw
off 4 of those feet.

93
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,985
So if I were to saw off
4 of these feet-- so

94
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:01,750
I saw off 1, 2, 3, 4.

95
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,170
How much wood do I have left?

96
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,040
So all of this stuff right
here, I'm eliminating.

97
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,660
I'm sawing it off.

98
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm sawing it off of the wood.

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,820
Maybe I should do that in
a darker color to show

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,250
that I'm sawing it off.

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,240
So all of this stuff is
going to disappear.

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,720
I'm grinding it away.

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,870
I'm sawing that off.

104
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,890
So I'm just left with-- after I
saw the 4 inches or feet or

105
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,880
whatever of the wood, I'm left
with 1, 2, 3 inches of wood.

106
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,600
So this is 3.

107
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,700
So 7 minus 4 is equal to 3.

108
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,410
This is viewing subtraction
as literally taking away.

109
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,380
I sawed off the wood,
so I took away wood.

110
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,070
Now I could think of it in a
slightly different way of

111
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,930
thinking about it, but give
you the exact same answer.

112
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,610
We could say 7 minus 4.

113
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,500
So once again, I could have
the 7 inch long piece

114
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,150
of wood like that.

115
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:05,280
So if I put a ruler here
that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

116
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,940
So once again, a 7 inch
long piece of wood.

117
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,080
And now instead of taking 4
away of it I'm comparing it--

118
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,740
so that's a 7-- I'm comparing
it to a 4 inch long

119
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,280
piece of wood.

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,830
So I have another 4 inch long
piece of wood right there.

121
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,750
That's my 4 inch long piece of
wood. that's 7, this is 4.

122
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,770
You could view 7 minus 4 as
taking 4 inches away from

123
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,580
the long piece of wood.

124
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,610
Or you could view seven minus 4
as the difference between the 4

125
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,530
inch piece of wood and the
7 inch piece of wood.

126
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,060
So in this case, what's
the difference?

127
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,310
To go from the 4 inch piece of
wood to the 7 inch piece of

128
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:45,030
wood I would have to grow by 3
inches, or I would have to add

129
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,370
a 3 inch piece of wood somehow.

130
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,600
Or the wood would somehow
have to grow by 3 inches in

131
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,170
order to become 7 inches.

132
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,480
So these are 2 completely
equivalent ways to

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,430
view subtraction.

134
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,370
That's all a little bit of a
review from the last video.

135
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,290
Now what I also want to do in
this video is start tackling

136
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,380
slightly larger problems.

137
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,170
But you'll see that really,
the number line applies just

138
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,070
equally as well as to kind
of the simpler problems

139
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,260
that we've done before.

140
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,380
Let's do 17 minus 9.

141
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,280
So just like everything
else, there's two ways

142
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,990
we could've done it.

143
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,280
You know, the more slow way is
you could draw 17 objects.

144
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,740
Let's say I have 17 chips.

145
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:35,790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

146
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,750
And I'm going to take
away 9 of them.

147
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,890
So I'm going to take away
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

148
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,810
How many am I left with?

149
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,450
I'm left with 1, 2,
3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8.

150
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,300
So 17 minus 9 is equal to 8.

151
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,390
But that took a long time and
you could imagine, if this

152
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,510
number was a lot bigger it
would've taken me forever to

153
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,570
draw all of these circles and
then scratch out things.

154
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,750
And it would've wasted
paper and time.

155
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,160
And we have other things to do.

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,050
So another way you could do it,
and maybe this would be easier

157
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,930
for you to visualize, is
to draw the number line.

158
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,260
You always don't
have to start at 0.

159
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,480
So if we draw the number line,
if we say that's 18, 17, 16,

160
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:32,210
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,
7-- you could imagine, I could

161
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,550
keep going to the left
all the way to 0.

162
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,790
But I start at 17.

163
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,460
I could start at 17 and
take away 9 from it.

164
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:49,460
So I go 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

165
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,370
And once again, we
are left at 8.

166
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,660
Now this was, at least in my
head, a little bit cleaner

167
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,110
and faster than this one.

168
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,190
But in either case, you don't
want to do this every time you

169
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,160
have to subtract 9 from 17 or
want to find the difference

170
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,052
between 17 and 9.

171
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:08,080
Eventually you'll want to internalize.

172
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
You'll want to know by heart
that, oh, 17 minus 9?

173
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
I know that is 8.

174
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,320
And by the way, 17 minus 8?

175
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,270
What's 17 minus 8?

176
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,710
Well, that is 9.

177
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,820
And now why does all
of this make sense?

178
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,270
Because 8 plus 9
is equal to 17.

179
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,860
So 17 minus 9 is 8.

180
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,330
Or 17 minus 8 is 9.

181
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,110
When I say 17 minus 8, I'm
essentially saying that is

182
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,550
equal to some number that if I
were to add to 8 will equal 17.

183
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,580
Well, that's 9.

184
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,720
When I say 17 minus 9 that's
saying, there's some number,

185
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,250
that if I were to add
it to 9, I'll get 17.

186
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,170
And that's 8.

187
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,620
So all of these, all of these
statements, are kind of

188
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,760
saying the same thing.

189
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,500
That 8 plus 9 are 17.

190
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,660
Or the difference
between 17 and 9 is 8.

191
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,120
Or the difference
between 17 and 8 is 9.

192
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
Hopefully I'm not
confusing you.

193
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,660
So for most of these
subtraction problems where the

194
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,620
answer is a one-digit answer,
you should eventually have them

195
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,980
memorized, but in your head
it's good to be imagining

196
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,640
this number line.

197
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,890
Let's do a couple
more of these.

198
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,470
And then, once we have these
memorized or at least be able

199
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,880
to do a number line if we
forget, I'll show you how to

200
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,460
do any subtraction problem,
arbitrarily for super

201
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,860
large numbers.

202
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,050
So let's say we're going
to do 13 minus 5.

203
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,660
So once again, I'm not going
to do the whole circles

204
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,540
or the berries this time.

205
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,460
I'm just going to draw
the number line.

206
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,720
Just draw the number
line like that.

207
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:58,450
Let's start at 14, 13, 12, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5-- and you

208
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,460
just can keep going
lower and lower.

209
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,510
You can go to 0 or you
can even go past 0.

210
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,830
We'll talk about
that in the future.

211
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,810
But we start at 13.

212
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,960
We're starting at 13.

213
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,620
And we're going to
take 5 away from it.

214
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,920
So this is the subtraction
view of subtraction;

215
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
we're taking away.

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,340
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and we land at 8.

217
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,010
So 13 minus 5-- let me
do this in a new color.

218
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,810
13 minus 5 is equal to 8.

219
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,580
Now another way we could
have thought about that,

220
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,980
I plotted where 13 is.

221
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,060
I can plot where 5 is.

222
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,850
I could say look, this is 5.

223
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,760
5 is right here on
my number line.

224
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,736
What do I have to add
to 5 to get to 13?

225
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,280
So let's see.

226
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,250
I would have to go 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

227
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,180
I have to add 8 to
5 to get to 13.

228
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,790
5 plus 8 is equal to 13.

229
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,940
So that tells me that 13
minus 5 is equal to 8.

230
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,210
This also tells me that 13
minus 8 is equal to 5.

231
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,690
All of these, are on some
level, telling me the

232
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,650
exact same thing.

233
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,635
But the difference
between 13 and 5 is 8.

234
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:14,410
The difference between
13 and 8 is 5.

235
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,080
5 plus 8 is 13.

236
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,780
So hopefully you have the hang
of that and if you haven't done

237
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,940
so already, it'll be good
to practice all of these.

238
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,240
Taking a teen number and then
subtracting any of the

239
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,470
one-digit numbers from
those teen numbers.

240
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,110
That's in general, very,
very good practice for you.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590


2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,410
Let's add 249 to 383.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,530
Now, the first thing you want
to do with any type of

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,860
addition problem, especially
when you have multiple digits,

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,490
is to write the two numbers
above and below each other.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,290
So we have 200-- let me write
a little bigger than that--

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:20,050
249 plus 383.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,170
And you want to line them up
so that we have the same

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,980
places above and below
each other.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,550
So the 9 and the 3 are both in
the ones place here, so we've

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,470
lined them up.

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,600
The 4 and the 8 are both in the
tens place, and the 2 and

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,890
the 3 are both in the
hundreds place.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,770
If you had a thousands place in
one of them and not in the

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,840
other, it would just kind of
be sitting out here by

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,640
themselves.

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,590
The easiest thing is just to
kind of both make them line up

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,160
to the right, or the
ones places.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,870
Now I'll show you the process,
but while we do the process,

20
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,520
we'll think a little bit about
why it makes sense.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,320
So we start at the ones place,
and we say what is 9 plus 3?

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,000
So we say 9 plus 3.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,990
Well, that's equal to 12.

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,740
I'm writing the 1 in 12 in
orange on purpose, because

25
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,770
when you want to write the sum
down here, you can't write a

26
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,660
two-digit number.

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,560
You can only write a digit
between 0 and 9.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,625
So what we do is 9 plus
3 is 12, that's the

29
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,270
equivalent of 10 plus 2.

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,720
So we write the 2 in the ones
place, and the 1, which is

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,740
really representing 10, we put
in the tens place, which

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,710
hopefully makes sense.

33
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,960
This now represents 10.

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,960
And now we want to add this
10 plus 40 plus 80.

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,710
It looks like we're adding a 1
to a 4 to an 8, but these are

36
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,430
really in the tens place,
so this is really a

37
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,920
10, a 40 and an 80.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,810
But if you just think about
the process, you just take

39
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:42,050
your 1, you add it to your 4 and
your 8-- plus 4 plus 8--

40
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,340
and what do you get?

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,040
1 plus 4 plus 8 is what?

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,370
5 plus 8, that is 13.

43
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,200
I'll write it like this.

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,860
Actually, this is in the tens
place, so it actually

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,540
represents 130, but you don't
have to think about that.

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,830
The process is fairly
straightforward.

47
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,740
You have 13.

48
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,700
You write the 3 down here, and
we regroup the 1 or, you might

49
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,130
have learned, you carry
the 1, so then you

50
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,650
carry the 1 up here.

51
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,590
Same process now in the
hundreds place.

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,730
This 1 actually represent a
hundred, because this was

53
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,190
actually 130 because it
was in the tens place.

54
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:22,900
So we have a 1 plus 2 plus
3, what is that?

55
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,040
Well, that's just 6, right?

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,060
1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 is 6.

57
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,715
So that is equal to 6.

58
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,600
So we write it right
over here.

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,680
So 249 plus 383 is 632.

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,934

1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,330
Say we have a right triangle.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,890
Let me draw my right triangle
just like that.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,530
This is a right triangle.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,650
This is the 90 degree
angle right here.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,100
And we're told that
this side's length

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,440
right here is 14.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,700
This side's length right
over here is 9.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,890
And we're told that
this side is a.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,030
And we need to find
the length of a.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,860
So as I mentioned already,
this is a right triangle.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,180
And we know that if we have a
right triangle, if we know two

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,110
of the sides, we can always
figure out a third side using

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,290
the Pythagorean theorem.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,000
And what the Pythagorean theorem
tells us is that the

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,400
sum of the squares of the
shorter sides is going to be

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,260
equal to the square of the
longer side, or the square of

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,360
the hypotenuse.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,820
And if you're not sure about
that, you're probably

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,690
thinking, hey Sal, how do I know
that a is shorter than

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,890
this side over here?

21
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,220
How do I know it's
not 15 or 16?

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,920
And the way to tell is that the
longest side in a right

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,190
triangle, and this only applies
to a right triangle,

24
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,180
is the side opposite the
90 degree angle.

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,450
And in this case, 14 is opposite
the 90 degrees.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,930
This 90 degree angle kind of
opens into this longest side.

27
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,170
The side that we call
the hypotenuse.

28
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,440
So now that we know that that's
the longest side, let

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,150
me color code it.

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,010
So this is the longest side.

31
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,180
This is one of the
shorter sides.

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,900
And this is the other of
the shorter sides.

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,910
The Pythagorean theorem tells us
that the sum of the squares

34
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:35,940
of the shorter sides, so a
squared plus 9 squared is

35
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,420
going to be equal
to 14 squared.

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,870
And it's really important that
you realize that it's not 9

37
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,070
squared plus 14 squared is
going to be equal to a

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,480
squared. a squared is one
of the shorter sides.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,920
The sum of the squares of these
two sides are going to

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,950
be equal to 14 squared, the
hypotenuse squared.

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,060
And from here, we just
have to solve for a.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:05,440
So we get a squared plus 81
is equal to 14 squared.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,200
In case we don't know
what that is, let's

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,060
just multiply it out.

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,419
14 times 14.

46
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,910
4 times 4 is 16.

47
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,590
4 times 1 is 4 plus 1 is 5.

48
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,430
Take a 0 there.

49
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,270
1 times 4 is 4.

50
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,390
1 times 1 is 1.

51
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,070
6 plus 0 is 6.

52
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,840
5 plus 4 is 9, bring
down the 1.

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,490
It's 196.

54
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:34,180
So a squared plus 81 is equal
to 14 squared, which is 196.

55
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,780
Then we could subtract 81 from
both sides of this equation.

56
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,650
On the left-hand side, we're
going to be left

57
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,640
with just the a squared.

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,120
These two guys cancel out, the
whole point of subtracting 81.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,230
So we're left with a squared
is equal to 196 minus 81.

60
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,480
What is that?

61
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,370
If you just subtract
1, it's 195.

62
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,880
If you subtract 80,
it would be 115 if

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,130
I'm doing that right.

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,420
And then to solve for a, we just
take the square root of

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,860
both sides, the principal square
root, the positive

66
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,140
square root of both sides
of this equation.

67
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,360
So let's do that.

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
Because we're dealing with
distances, you can't have a

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,840
negative square root, or a
negative distance here.

70
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:31,140
And we get a is equal to
the square root of 115.

71
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,170
Let's see if we can break
down 115 any further.

72
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,980
So let's see.

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,080
It's clearly divisible by 5.

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,900
If you factor it out, it's
5, and then 5 goes

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,270
in the 115 23 times.

76
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,920
So both of these are
prime numbers.

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,410
So we're done.

78
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,670
So you actually can't
factor this anymore.

79
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,800
So a is just going to be equal
to the square root of 115.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,330
Now if you want to get a sense
of roughly how large the

81
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,280
square root of 115 is, if you
think about it, the square

82
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,370
root of 100 is equal to 10.

83
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,020
And the square root of
121 is equal to 11.

84
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,050
So this value right here is
going to be someplace in

85
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,180
between 10 and 11, which
makes sense if you

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,140
think about it visually.

This is a question about peg solitaire.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In peg solitaire, a single player faces

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the following kind of board.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Initially, all pieces are occupied except for the center piece.

I wish to know whether this game is partially observable,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please say yes or no.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I wish to know whether it is stochastic.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please say yes if it is and no if it's deterministic.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let me know if it's continuous, yes or no,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and let me know if it's adversarial, yes or no.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,590
Multiply, expressing the
product in scientific notation.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,670
So let's multiply
first, and then let's

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,094
try to get what we have
in scientific notation.

5
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,510
Actually, before
we do that, let's

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,480
just even remember what it means
to be in scientific notation.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
To be in scientific
notation-- and actually,

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,750
each of these numbers right
here are in scientific notation.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,950
It's going to be
the form a times 10

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,820
to some power, where a can be
greater than or equal to 1,

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,670
and it is going to
be less than 10.

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,227
So both of these numbers are
greater than or equal to 1,

13
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,810
and they are less
than 10, and they're

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,220
being multiplied by
some power of 10.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,940
Let's see how we
could multiply this.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,060
So this over here, this is
just the exact same thing.

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,420
So if I do this in magenta,
this is the exact same thing

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:54,410
as 9.1 times 10 to the sixth
times 3.2 times-- actually,

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,620
I don't have to write it.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,600
Let me write it all
with a dot notation

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,475
to make it a little bit
more straightforward.

22
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:02,095

23
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,555
I'm doing that in magenta.

24
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:12,150
This is equal to 9.1
times 10 to the sixth--

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,760
let me do it in this green
color-- times 3.2 times 10

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,970
to the negative 5th power.

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,260
Now in multiplication,
this comes

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,740
from the associative property.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,540
It essentially allows us to
remove these parentheses.

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,560
It says, look, you can
multiply like that first,

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,630
or you could actually
multiply these guys first.

32
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,040
You can reassociate them.

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,605
And the commutative
property tells us

34
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:36,004
that we can rearrange
this thing right here.

35
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,420
What I want to
rearrange is I want

36
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,860
to multiply the 9.1 times
the 3.2 first and then

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,382
multiply that times 10 to the
sixth times 10 the negative 5.

38
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:44,840
So I'm just going
to rearrange this

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,740
using the commutative property.

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,410
This is the same thing
as 9.1 times 3.2,

41
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,060
and I'm going to reassociate.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,920
So I'm going to do these
first, and then that times 10

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,920
to the sixth times
10 to the negative 5.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,440

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,990
And the reason
why this is useful

46
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,070
is that this is really
easy to multiply.

47
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,610
We have the same
base here, base 10,

48
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,370
and we're taking the product,
so we can add the exponents.

49
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,239
So this part right over here,
10 to the sixth times 10

50
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,780
to the negative 5,
that's going to be

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,180
10 to the 6 minus 5 power,
or essentially just 10

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,370
to the first power, which
is really just equal to 10.

53
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,590
And that's going to be
multiplied by 9.1 times 3.2.

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,760
So let me do that over here.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,767
If I have 9.1 times
3.2, so at first

56
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm going to ignore the
decimal, so I'm just

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,690
going to treat it
like 91 times 32.

58
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,695
So I have 2 times 1 is 2.

59
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:50,020
2 times 9 is 18.

60
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,330
I'll stick a 0 here because
I'm in the tens place

61
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,210
now, multiplying everything
really by 30 not just by 3.

62
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,100
That's why my zero is there.

63
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,840
And I multiplied 3
times 1 to get 3,

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,230
and then 3 times 9 is 27.

65
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,220
And so it is 2.

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,290
So I'm adding here.

67
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,860
2 plus 0 is 2.

68
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,980
8 plus 3 is 11, carry
or regroup that 1.

69
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,360
1 plus 1 is 2.

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,990
2 plus 7 is 9.

71
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,760
And then I have a 2 here.

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
So 91 times 32 is 2,912.

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,740
But I didn't
multiply 91 times 32.

74
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,110
I multiplied 9.1 times 3.2.

75
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,850
So what I want to do
is count the number

76
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,050
of digits I have behind
the decimal point.

77
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,571
I have one, two digits
behind the decimal point,

78
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,070
and so I'll have to have two
digits behind the decimal point

79
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,690
in the answer.

80
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,330
So one, two, I'll stick the
decimal right over there.

81
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,550
This part right over here
comes out to be 29.12.

82
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,890
You might feel like we're done.

83
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,150
This kind of looks like
scientific notation.

84
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,970
I have a number
times a power of 10.

85
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,010
But remember, this number has to
be greater than or equal to 1--

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,410
which it is-- and less than 10.

87
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,240
But this number is
not less than 10.

88
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,534
It's not in scientific notation.

89
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:08,950
What we can do is
let's just write

90
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,100
this number in
scientific notation,

91
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,830
and then we can use
the power of 10 part

92
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,490
to multiply by this power of 10.

93
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,540

94
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,890
29.12, this is the
same thing as 2.912.

95
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,270
Notice, what did I do to
go from there to there?

96
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,410
I just moved the
decimal to the left.

97
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,980
Or another way to
think about it,

98
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,060
if I wanted to go from here to
there, what could I do to this?

99
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,660
Well, I would multiply it by 10.

100
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,800
If I multiplied it by 10,
I would move the decimal

101
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,380
to the right.

102
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,590
It would go from 2.9 to 29.

103
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,120
So if I want to
write this value,

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,900
this is just this times 10.

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,360
So 29.12 is the same
thing as 2.912 times 10.

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,250
Now, this is in
scientific notation,

107
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
but that's just this part.

108
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,600
And I still have to
multiply it by another 10,

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,510
so times another 10.

110
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:09,322
To finish up this problem, we
get 2.912 times 10 times 10,

111
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,030
or 10 to the first
times 10 to the first.

112
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,130
Well, what's that?

113
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, that's going to be
this part right over here.

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,740
That's just 10 squared.

115
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,170
So it's 2.912 times 10 to the
second power, and we are done.

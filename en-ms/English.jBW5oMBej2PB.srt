1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,369
We're now going to learn how to go from mixed numbers

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:05,660
to improper fractions and vice versa.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,110
So first a little bit of terminology.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,490
What is a mixed number?

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,340
Well, you've probably seen someone write,

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,840
let's say, two and one half.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,460
This is a mixed number.

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,940
So you're saying why is it a mixed number?

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,848
Well, because we're including a whole number and a fraction.

10
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:22,610
So that's why it's a mixed number.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,500
It's a whole number mixed with a fraction.

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,230
So two and one half.

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,750
And I think you have a sense of what two and one half is.

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,040
It's some place halfway between two and three.

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,080
And what's an improper fraction?

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,681
Well an improper fraction

17
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:37,390
is a fraction where the numerator is larger than the denominator.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,320
So let's give an example of an improper fraction.

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,130
I'm just going to pick some random numbers.

20
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,750
Let's say I had twenty-three over five.

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,380
This is an improper fraction.

22
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,090
Why?

23
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,280
Because twenty-three is larger than five.

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,020
It's that simple.

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,712
It turns out that you can convert an improper fraction into a mixed number

26
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:01,350
or a mixed number into an improper fraction.

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,770
So let's start with the latter.

28
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,591
Let's learn how to do a mixed number into an improper fraction.

29
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:11,395
So first I'll just show you kind of just the basic systematic way of doing it.

30
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:12,549
It'll always give you the right answer,

31
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,100
and then hopefully I'll give you a little intuition for why it works.

32
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,937
So if I wanted to convert two and one half into an improper fraction,

33
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:21,085
or I want to unmix it you could say,

34
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:28,349
all I do is I take the denominator in the fraction part, multiply it by the whole number,

35
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,140
and add the numerator.

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,120
So let's do that.

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,570
I think if we do enough examples,

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,580
you'll get the pattern.

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,330
So two times two is four plus one is five.

40
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,040
So let's write that.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,935
It's two times two plus one,

42
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:47,580
and that's going to be the new numerator.

43
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,300
And it's going to be all of that over the old denominator.

44
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,130
So that equals five halves.

45
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,122
So two and one half is equal to five halves.

46
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,253
Let's do another one.

47
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:08,050
Let's say I had four and two thirds.

48
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,940
This is equal to -- so this is going to be all over three.

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,480
We keep the denominator the same.

50
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,170
And the new numerator is going to be three times four plus two.

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,030
So it's going to be three times four, and then you're going to add two.

52
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,538
Well that equals three times four--

53
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,566
order of operations, you always do multiplication first,

54
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,930
and that's actually the way I taught it-- how to convert this, anyway.

55
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,230
three times four is twelve plus two is fourteen.

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,330
So that equals fourteen over three.

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,020
Let's do another one.

58
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:48,710
Let's say I had six and seventeen eighteenths.

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,520
I gave myself a hard problem.

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Well, we just keep the denominator the same.

61
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,457
And then new numerator is going to be eighteen times six

62
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:03,950
or six times eighteen, plus seventeen.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,190
Well six times eighteen.

64
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,523
Let's see, that's sixty plus forty-eight it's one hundred eight,

65
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:11,900
so that equals one hundred eight plus seventeen.

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,300
All that over eighteen.

67
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,060
One hundred eight plus seventeen is equal to one hundred twenty-five over eighteen.

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:29,140
So, six and seventeen eighteenths is equal to one hundred twenty-five over eighteen.

69
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,090
Let's do a couple more.

70
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,477
And in a couple minutes I'm going to teach you how to go the other way,

71
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:40,152
how to go from an improper fraction to a mixed number.

72
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:44,836
And this one I'm going to try to give you a little bit of intuition for why what I'm teaching you actually works.

73
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:51,902
So let's say two and one fourth.

74
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:55,617
If we use the-- I guess you'd call it a system that I just showed you--

75
00:03:55,617 --> 00:04:04,120
that equals four times two plus one over four.

76
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,710
Well that equals, four times two is eight plus one is nine. Nine over four.

77
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,100
I want to give you an intuition for why this actually works.

78
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,771
So two and one fourth, let's actually draw that,

79
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,260
see what it looks like.

80
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,190
So let's put this back into kind of the pie analogy.

81
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,120
So that's equal to one pie.

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,030
Two pies.

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,830
And then let's say, one fourth of a pie. Oh, sorry.

84
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,275
One fourth is like this. A fourth of a pie, right?

85
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:41,559
Two and one fourth, and ignore this, this is nothing.

86
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,138
It's not a decimal point-- actually, let me erase it

87
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:51,854
so it doesn't confuse you even more.

88
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:53,923
So go back to the pieces of the pie.

89
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,631
So there's two and one fourth pieces of pie.

90
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:04,955
And we want to rewrite this as just, how many fourths of pie are there total?

91
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,868
Well if we take each of these pies--

92
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,985
oh, whoops! I need to change the color--

93
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:12,605
if we take each of these pies,

94
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,108
and we divide it into fourths,

95
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:19,050
we can now say how many total fourths of pie do we have?

96
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:28,490
Well we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine fourths.

97
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,750
Makes sense, right?

98
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,610
Two and one fourth is the same thing as nine fourths.

99
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,920
And this will work with any fraction.

100
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,820
So let's go the other way.

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,690
Let's figure out how to go from an improper fraction

102
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,685
to a mixed number.

103
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:49,250
Let's say I had twenty-three over five.

104
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,060
So here we go in the opposite direction.

105
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,813
We actually take the denominator,

106
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:55,070
we say how many times does it go into the numerator?

107
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,630
And then we figure out the remainder.

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,797
So let's say five goes into twenty-three--

109
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,390
well, five goes into twenty-three four times.

110
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,880
Four times five is twenty.

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,230
And the remainder is three.

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,925
So twenty-three over five, we can say that's equal to four,

113
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,960
and in the remainder, three over five.

114
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,419
So it's four and three fifths.

115
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,842
Let's review what we just did.

116
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,405
We just took the denominator

117
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,130
and divided it into the numerator.

118
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,810
So five goes into twenty-three four times.

119
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,040
And what's left over is three.

120
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,920
So, five goes into twenty-three four and three fifths times.

121
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,240
Or another way of saying that is twenty-three over five is four and three fifths.

122
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,260
Let's do another example like that.

123
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,809
Let's say, seventeen over eight.

124
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,649
What does that equal as a mixed number?

125
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,908
You can actually do this in your head,

126
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:59,420
but I'll write it out just so you don't get confused.

127
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,540
Eight goes into seventeen two times.

128
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Two times eight is sixteen.

129
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,370
Seventeen minus sixteen is one.

130
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,800
Remainder, one.

131
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:19,060
So, seventeen over eight is equal to two-- that's this two-- and one eighth.

132
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,610
Right? Because we have one eight left over.

133
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,405
Let me show you kind of a visual way of representing this too,

134
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:28,570
so it actually makes sense how this conversion is working.

135
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,530
Let's say I had five halves, right?

136
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,508
So that literally means I have five halves,

137
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:40,710
or if we go back to the pizza or the pie analogy,

138
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,536
let's draw my five halves of pizza.

139
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:49,362
So let's say I have one half of pizza here,

140
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:51,745
and let's say I have another half of pizza here.

141
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:54,520
I just flipped it over.

142
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,330
So that's two.

143
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,833
So it's one half, two halves.

144
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,564
So that's three halves.

145
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,539
And then I have a fourth half here.

146
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,198
These are halves of pizza,

147
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:10,650
and then I have a fifth half here, right?

148
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,910
So that's five halves.

149
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,140
Well, if we look at this, if we combine these two halves,

150
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,627
this is equal to one piece, I have another piece,

151
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,910
and then I have half of a piece, right?

152
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:31,320
So that is equal to two and one half pizzas.

153
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,000
Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,865
And if we wanted to do this the systematic way,

155
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:41,011
we could have said two goes into five--

156
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,342
well, two goes into five two times,

157
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:46,550
and that two is right here.

158
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,160
And then two times two is four.

159
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,716
Five minus four is one, so the remainder is one,

160
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,040
and that's what we use here.

161
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,695
And of course, we keep the denominator the same.

162
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:59,080
So five halves equals two and one half.

163
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,766
Hopefully that gives you a sense of how to go from a mixed number to an improper fraction,

164
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:04,555
and vice versa,

165
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:07,510
from an improper fraction to a mixed number.

166
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,204
If you're still confused let me know,

167
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,650
and I might make some more modules.

168
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,161
Have fun with the exercises!

Episode 5

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,086
What are you doing? Like a thief.

4
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:22,657
That's not it. I had to look for something.

5
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,955
Do you expect me to believe that?

6
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:30,452
When there is nobody but us home,

7
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:34,592
you suddenly had something to find?

8
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:42,207
No. Really.

9
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:43,946
Are they busy?

10
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:48,487
Seems like they're sleeping.

11
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,691
Why are you like this?

12
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:52,616
What do you mean why am I like this?

13
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,066
Didn't you come in here wanting this?

14
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,805
What?

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,262
No!

16
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:59,545
So what?

17
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:05,879
We're the only ones in the house.

18
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,555
Seung Jo, why are you like this?

19
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:13,284
Seung Jo ssi!

20
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:21,615
Aigoo!

21
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,009
First...

22
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:32,000
...let's soundly date.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,002
Soundly?

24
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:43,156
When was that word ever used?

25
00:01:43,156 --> 00:02:13,047
Soundly.

26
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:15,185
Oh. You came.

27
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,431
What the...

28
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,021
What's wrong with Oh Ha Ni?

29
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,279
Her face is really red.

30
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,676
Really?

31
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:55,047
I wonder what's wrong.

32
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,336
Stupid jerk.

33
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:27,326
Always playing around with me.

34
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:31,988
Am I really dumb?

35
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:40,255
After this (the love letter being graded)...

36
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,575
Doongi ah.

37
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:47,455
Is it supposed to be like this?

38
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,838
My heart...

39
00:03:49,838 --> 00:04:04,655
...it isn't doing what I want it to do.

40
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:06,551
- Hey, what about Oh Ha Ni?- She must not be on here.

41
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,173
- Did Oh Ha Ni's grades drop?

42
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:12,888
- What happened? Why isn't she on here?

43
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:15,921
So it was because of Baek Seung Jo's help.

44
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,555
After going to the Special Study Hall,I found out it wasn't that great.

45
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:24,488
The kids there are weird too.

46
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:25,688
Anyway...

47
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:32,721
Out of all those colleges,isn't there one we can go to?

48
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:48,355
There will be one. A collegethat will accept you... There will be one.

49
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,088
Let's try for a special circumstance admission.

50
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,521
A special circumstance admission?

51
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:56,619
In truth, for an exceptional admission you need to have many letters of recommendation and awards or trophies as well.

52
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:59,921
Anyway, you have to be really good at something.

53
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:00,688
This...

54
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:04,555
Even though one may not be doing that well now, they choose those who they think will do well in the future.

55
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,188
Ah! Latent potential!

56
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:07,321
That's right!

57
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:10,555
Here, let's look for a place that'll match us.

58
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:16,121
By any chance, was your grandfather a patriot?

59
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:18,055
It's okay if it's the grandfather on the mother's side.

60
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:24,855
Really?

61
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,721
Ha Ni.

62
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:31,055
Your grandfather (maternal)...

63
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:35,121
...was a shutter man (opens and closes the shop shutter, i.e., while his wife works, he plays).

64
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:36,855
Ah, he was ahead of his time...

65
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,088
Okay. Uhhh...

66
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:44,155
Was your father a special agent?

67
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:47,121
Special missions?

68
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,821
Well...

69
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:56,488
There is something special in making noodles.

70
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,655
Ha Ni, it will work if you're the female householder.

71
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:02,088
Ha Ni...

72
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:05,188
Your dad...

73
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:08,321
Should I just move out?

74
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,321
It's unlikely...

75
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:15,721
...but you're not from amulticultural heritage, are you?

76
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:16,788
Multicultural heritage?

77
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,621
Think about it, Dad.

78
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,688
Did Mom possibly speak Thai or anything like that?

79
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:25,121
She didn't do that?

80
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:31,055
Thai?

81
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:41,255
Tom Yam Koong!(a kind of Thai food called sour soup)

82
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:46,155
Does this mean that there's nota single one out of all of these?

83
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,255
I'm worrying! Stop doing that!

84
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,788
Blood donation?

85
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:55,488
You can have it. There's a lot at home.

86
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,655
Do you donate a lot of blood?

87
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,321
Once every two months.

88
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:01,521
I donate more through money.

89
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,321
You should have said something earlier!

90
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,921
It says that giving blood onceequals ten hours of service!

91
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:08,255
Really?!

92
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,588
Then, if it's ten times... 100 hours?!

93
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,721
Yeah!

94
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,055
I found it.

95
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,355
The "Giving Back to the Community" option.

96
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,455
Social Science.

97
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,488
Parang University?

98
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:24,121
Yeah.

99
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,621
Min Ah, you're also goingto Parang University, right?

100
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:27,321
Yeah, as an animation major.

101
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,821
Our teacher said to try it once.

102
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,621
Wow, then are you bothgoing to Parang University?

103
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,255
If we get in that is.

104
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,655
Even if the application goes through,I heard the interview process is very picky.

105
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:38,855
I have a skill examination as well.

106
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:46,121
How come our teacher didn't sayanything to me about Parang University?

107
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:47,488
What are you doing?!

108
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,921
Look at you. Stop eating.

109
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:53,321
I'm getting angry so give it to me.

110
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,921
Ju Ri.

111
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:58,521
I was wondering why we hadn't seen you around, especially since Oh Ha Ni is here.

112
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,155
What?

113
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:02,188
Did you put some kind of tracker on her?

114
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:05,321
How did you just pop out of nowhere like a ghost?

115
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:08,588
You guys still don't know?

116
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,821
Ha Ni is my life's navigation system.

117
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:15,821
She tells me where I need to go,location, direction, speed.

118
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:18,321
Navigation my butt.

119
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,488
Hey, where are all your little friendsand why did you come alone?

120
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,255
They went to an audition.

121
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:24,288
They practice for auditions after all.

122
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,788
Really?

123
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:30,555
Oh my, I thought they were auditionapplicants since they go to auditions all the time.

124
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,055
What are you saying, girl?

125
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,821
What? What?

126
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,488
Isn't that Baek Seung Jo?

127
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:42,621
I think you should go to a schoolwith lots of history and tradition...

128
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,388
...a university that hasproduced many great scholars.

129
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:46,955
Or the American Ivy Leagues...

130
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:51,355
Who's the guy in front of him?

131
00:08:51,355 --> 00:09:30,011
What are they talking about?

132

[Student Personal Information Form]

134
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,843
Special skill?

135
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,071
Specialty?

136
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,177
Specialty?!

137
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:13,543
Specialty?! Specialty?!

138
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,477
You're working hard.

139
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:16,443
Of course.

140
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:20,043
Do you think I'm a teacher who playsaround like a certain someone?

141
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,445
Me?

142
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:26,143
When...have I ever played aroundthat makes you say that?

143
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:27,743
Vice principal.

144
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:28,643
Please give me what you told me about a while ago.

145
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,143
What was it?

146
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:34,543
Ah! The Principal's recommendation?

147
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,043
How can I do that?!

148
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:39,377
How can I give a Principal's recommendationto the bottom ranked students?

149
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:43,143
Oh Ha Ni went up from the bottomranks to the top fifty in one week.

150
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,843
If that's not potential, then what is?

151
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,577
The special case admissions look at potential.

152
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,143
Yes, that is so.

153
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:51,077
Look at the kids who got into college last year.

154
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:54,743
70% were ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class.

155
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:58,243
Just because a person has passion,does that make them a good teacher?

156
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:02,777
They have to be able to teach the kidsabout looking into reality properly.

157
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:06,021
If Oh Ha Ni gets into Parang University...

158
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:20,061
...then I am Teacher Song's child.

159
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:26,243
Always passionate...

160
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:29,143
Excuse me...

161
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,031
This.

162
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:33,543
It's vitamin C.

163
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,649
You should dissolve it in water.

164
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,877
This is the first time,

165
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:46,001
you seem like a person.

166
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:55,643
You're head over heels for me, aren't you?!

167
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,031
It's done!

168
00:11:57,031 --> 00:12:00,243
Uh... Self introduction.

00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:03,001
I was born August 11th...

170
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,011
Okay.

171
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:08,152
Okay, so now...

172
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:12,643
I just have to register...

173
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:13,655
What!

174
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:16,977
What's wrong with this? Why isn't it opening?!

175
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:18,134
What?

176
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:21,543
Error Report?"Please click here."

177
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:25,011
Click.

178
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,777
"What you were working on..."

179
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:42,643
"...will be lost."

180
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:45,071
Is it going well?

181
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:49,067
Why did you have so many useless tabs open?

182
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:52,143
I didn't!

183
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:55,001
What do I do? What do I do?!

184
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,243
What to do?!

185
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,843
It's going to be okay, Ha Ni.It couldn't have all been erased.

186
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:05,061
In a little bit, it will close.

187
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,031
Urgh, shut up!

188
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:18,077
I can't think straight.

189
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:18,587
It's fixed!

190
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:19,743
Really?

191
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,577
What about the written application?

192
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:22,041
It's there!

193
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,243
Really? It's not gone?

194
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:28,011
Yes, he found it!

195
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:32,143
Oh, thank you.

196
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:35,041
Stop fooling around and quickly get the receipt.

197
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:40,377
Yes.

198
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:42,077
Oh, it's a relief.

199
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:44,071
Hurry and go downstairs to have dinner.

200
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:49,643
Let's go, Eun Jo.

201
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:53,477
Let's go down.

202
00:13:53,477 --> 00:14:01,077
What's wrong?

203
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:05,243
Thank you.

204
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:07,177
Parang University undergraduate course?

205
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,643
Yes.

206
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:11,477
Actually, there aren't a lot of possibilities for me.

207
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:12,081
My grades are really bad.

208
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:15,743
You went that crazy when you don'teven really have a chance?

209
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:20,477
Still, I have to try doing what I can.

210
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:21,071
Why are you going to college?

211
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,977
Huh?

212
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:26,543
Why do you ask?Well, to study and...

213
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:30,777
Having nothing you're good at,nor a field you're interested in...

214
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,041
...why are you still doing this?

215
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:38,011
If not to study, then I can find my purpose in life.

216
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:42,343
Find out about what I like or what I'm good at.

217
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:45,943
How would you know if you like something?

218
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:48,031
Of course you would know!

219
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:52,477
Your heart starts beating fast.

220
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:55,477
If you find something you like,

221
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,071
it'll beat fast here.

222
00:14:57,071 --> 00:15:13,051
My dad... When he smellsnoodles drying, his heart still beats fast.

223
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,031
I'd like to experience it too,

224
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:20,743
that kind of feeling.

225
00:15:20,743 --> 00:15:29,081
Ah, hurry!

226
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:32,081
I wonder why I'm going to college?

227
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:38,031
I've never worried about it before.

228
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:48,043
After all, geniuses must have their own worries.

229
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:55,456
Did he show me a little of his feelings?

230
00:15:55,456 --> 00:16:00,556
Ah!

[Acceptance Letter]

233
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:12,002
Did you have to print them out?

234
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:15,656
It feels good.

235
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:20,989
Well, there are always those one or two mysteries.

236
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:31,656
Yes, there are. But, please, it would benice if they weren't from Class 7.

237
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:39,756
Then, if you pass the interviewyou can go to Parang University?

238
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,365
They said they chose a lot.

239
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,989
The competition isn't a joke.

240
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:47,487
They only picked a multiple of five.

241
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:51,242
But, what will they ask at the interviews?

242
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,656
I'm not really good with speaking.

243
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:55,356
I still have the skills exam too.

244
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:59,123
There is no way my Ha Ni can fail that interview.

245
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:02,223
Even if she does fail, at least she got it.

246
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:05,389
My Ha Ni is really good, isn't she?!

247
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,189
Ha Ni sunbae, do you have some kind of backing?

248
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,329
Backing?

249
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:22,839
Yeah. The heavens must've helped me.

250
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,989
The 11th typhoon, "La Na Nim",is blowing through Korea.

251

Ha Ni!

252
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,169
Dad! What is this?!

253
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:32,218
The subway is going to be safe.

254
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,356
Ha Ni, will you be okay?

255
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,251
Of course! After all, it's just raining.

256
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,723
It's not just raining! There's a typhoon out there.

257
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,077
Right!

258
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:45,006
Just don't...

259
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:48,856
How about giving up the interview?

260
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:49,889
Why!

261
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,956
You think I don't have a chance of getting in?

262
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,156
You don't believe in me, Dad?!

263
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,294
Th...that's not it!

264
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:56,508
Just look at the weather!

265
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,056
This is the only place that willaccept me despite my grades.

266
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:04,623
Even if it's only because I'm grateful, I have to go.

267
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:06,612
Dad, don't worry.

268
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:07,889
I'll be going now!

269
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,056
Bye!

270
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,756
Right! Right!

271
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,051
- Be careful!- I'll see you later.

272
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:15,016
- But just wait.- I don't wanna!

273
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:17,086
Nothing's going easily.

274
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:23,086
You're right. A typhoon coming so suddenly.

275
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:28,727
Because the tracks are filled with water,the subway will not continue to run.

276
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:46,006
All passengers are asked toleave the train at the next stop,and find other means of transportationto reach their destinations.

277
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:49,016
Seoul, Kyung Gi schools have alreadyclosed today because of the typhoon.

278

Typhoon warning:Schools in the central district of Seoul will be closed.

279

282
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,427
Student, you didn't have a lot of trouble getting here?

283
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,056
My house is nearby.

284
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:12,392
That's a relief.

285
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:18,031
You can leave this way.

286
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:25,555
Only a small number of students have arrived.

287
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,046
Excuse me...

288
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:30,788
Many students were not able to make it.

289
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:33,006
Wouldn't it be best if we postpone the interviews?

290
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,127
How many typhoons will come in one's lifetime?

291
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:36,927
Eh?

292
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:42,294
Whenever that happens, should wepostpone and end it here?

293
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,094
Send in the next one.

Eun Jo, what are you doing?

297
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:16,092
Alright! I'm not going to schoolbecause of the typhoon.

298
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:20,042
Aigoo, Ha Ni going to aninterview in this kind of weather...

299
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:35,587
I hope the results are good.

300
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:38,453
This is interesting.

301
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:41,153
Well then, what are you most interested in?

302
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:46,421
Oh, that. It's Baek Seung Jo!

303
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:50,002
Um, what I meant to say was...

304
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:51,553
...a person.

305
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:54,002
Oh, you have an interest in people?

306
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,012
Yes! That's right, people!

307
00:20:57,012 --> 00:21:00,687
Recently, I've been thinking...

308
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:04,061
...if we were to get to know other people,

309
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,092
how much time would it take to get to know them?

310
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:11,453
In our lifetime, could we fully understand...

311
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:15,053
...even one person?

312
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:21,387
I don't think I could ever understand Baek Seung Jo.

313
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:25,087
Why must we choose you?

314
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,012
Excuse me?

315
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:29,987
Your teacher's letter of recommendation...

316
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:33,032
...is almost at the level of a pledge in blood.

317
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:34,587
Even so...

318
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:39,453
In a week, you were able to raiseyour grades from the 90th place to the 50th.

319
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:44,753
However, on the very next test,you dropped back down again.

320
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:49,253
And since last year, every two months...

321
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:52,012
...you've donated blood.

322
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:56,787
That is all. How could you possiblyhave passed the first round?

323
00:21:56,787 --> 00:22:00,748
She got a high score for her personal introduction.

324

If there is any reason why we must choose you,Oh Ha Ni, then please do tell!

327
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:20,687
There's one minute left.

328
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,853
Uh. That...

329
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:27,072
Okay. If you don't have any,you don't have to say anything.

330
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,042

00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:46,022
Excuse me.

334
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:51,062
You were right. You saw through me.

335
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:57,052
I really don't have anything that I do well.

336
00:22:57,052 --> 00:23:01,653
Passing the first round was a miracle for me.

337
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:04,853
So, in truth, I'm really thankful.

338
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:08,062
However, I think I could say this...

339
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:10,387
If it's not me,

340
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:13,092
and you picked another student withgood grades and lots of awards...

341
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:17,187
Anyway, if you picked such a stellar student,

342
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,022
but if that student is lazy, and doesn't work hard!

343
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:24,453
When it's rainy and windy, he gives up.

344
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:28,153
So, then if you guys think that personisn't right for your college,

345
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:33,687
if that happens, then choose me!

346
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:36,062
I'm slower than other people,

347
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:39,062
but I never give up.

348
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:41,387
I always do everything till the end.

349
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:46,012
That's why my nickname is "Noah's Snail."

350
00:23:46,012 --> 00:24:05,587
Try having a snail as a pet.

351
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,012
I don't think I'm going to make it.

352
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,002
I knew...

353
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:13,152
Ah well, the results haven't come yet.

354
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:16,287
Yeah, that's right. You can studyand go together with Seung Jo.

355
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,487
I'm not going to take the exam.

356
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:22,187
What?

357
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:24,453
I'm saying that I don't want to take the exam.

358
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:25,082
I'm not going to college.

359
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:28,487
Yeah, but why?

360
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:30,753
Because there isn't anything I want to do.

361
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,953
And I don't want to go anywhere either.

362
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:35,587
Huh. Then, what will you do after graduating?

363
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:37,653
Well, I could work part time.

364
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:39,062
Baek Seung Jo!

365
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,032
Is your life a joke!?

366
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:45,042
Do you live life however you feel like living it?

367
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:51,002
Well, then do you want todo business with your mom?

368
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:52,062
What about running an internet shopping mall?

369
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:55,587
Then, how am I supposed to live?

370
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:56,453
What?

371
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,053
Because I don't know how to live...

372
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,987
...is why I say I won't go.

373
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:06,987
Because I don't want to live likeother people, without any motives.

374
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:09,753
How should I live?

375
00:25:09,753 --> 00:25:12,002
Aye... Tec... That's...

376
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:16,853
You can study and take over your father's company.

377
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:20,012
You know that I'm selfish, right?

378
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:22,082
A business that doesn't fit my liking...

379
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:26,087
I don't have any plans of working there.

380
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,052
Don't expect anything from me.

381
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:29,853
Baek Seung Jo!

382
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:36,022
I'm done eating.

383
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:37,987
Really... That punk...

384
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,002
Aish.

385
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:44,453
He's only saying that; it's not like he won't take it. Don't worry.

386
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:45,092
Y-y-yeah, right.

387
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:52,002
No matter what he does, he can do it with ease,that must be why he doesn't feel any motivation.

388
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:57,072
He has to find a field of interest soon.

389
00:25:57,072 --> 00:26:04,072
I'd really like to experience it too. That feeling.

390
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:06,987
Min Ah's.

391
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:11,087
- We'll enjoy the meal!- We'll enjoy the meal!

392
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:16,453
Here... I made these for you guyson such a special occasion.

393
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,853
The name is Bul Nak porridge.

394
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,487
Bul Nak porridge?

395
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:23,062
It's written right here.Bul means "not," Nak means "fail". Never fail.

396
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:26,187
- Ahhh.- It's really written.

397
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,353
What did you write this with?

398
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:31,022
You don't know? They're sesame seeds.

399
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,353
So, it means that if you eat this,you guys will never fail.

400
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:37,062
Oh really!? Then I'll just haveto eat everything here.

401
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:41,353
Hey, Jung Ju Ri. Stop it.Is this all yours?

402
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:44,953
What? "Ah, is this all yours?"Is he speaking Japanese?

403
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,787
Jung Ju Ri, just stop it.Are all these yours?

404
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:49,002
Yeah. She's right right right!

405
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:52,453
Yes, eat up.

406
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:54,353
Ha Ni, you aren't eating?

407
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:55,072
I'm eating.

408
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,553
Ha Ni. What? Are you getting nervous?

409
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:00,353
There's no need!

410
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,012
Just eat up all this that your dad made for you.

411
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,587
Then just walk down proudly! Right?

412
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:11,653
Yeah, you too.

413
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:14,012
Ah. Father.

414
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:16,653
This recipe is just killer!

415
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,253
Is this octopus?

416
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:19,092
Aigoo, you know well.

417
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:22,653
Father, I told you last time.

418
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:25,092
My taste buds are really sensitive.

419
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:27,887
I can't let it go.

420
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:31,987
Well, eat a lot! And do well on the test tomorrow.

421
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:34,087
Like the octopus, stick to (get into) a college.

422
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:37,253
Yes.

423
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:38,012
Dad.

424
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:39,253
Yes?

425
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:51,487
Could you pack one more of this porridge?

426
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:57,062
Are you sleeping?

427
00:27:57,062 --> 00:28:00,853
Baek Seung Jo.

428
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:05,887
You're going to take that test tomorrow, right?

429
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:08,687
Everyone is worried about you.

430
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,052
Especially your father.

431
00:28:11,052 --> 00:28:16,687
He keeps worrying about youand he doesn't laugh very often.

432
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:22,653
First you could take the test, then lateryou can make a decision on college.

433
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,587
If you don't take the test,

434
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:28,887
but suddenly you figure out whatyou want to do, then what will you do?

435
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:36,012
Open the door for a moment.

436
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:39,032
You can do anything.

437
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:44,042
So, you have to use your headfor the sake of other people.

438
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:49,653
I believe that people who have a lotneed to share what they have.

439
00:28:49,653 --> 00:29:01,002
Even though I want to share everything,I don't have anything, so I can't.

440
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:05,187
This... I'll just leave it here.

441
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:11,062
Eat it before it cools.

442
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:15,853
Also...

443
00:29:15,853 --> 00:30:07,092
See you tomorrow.

444
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:10,453
[Good luck on the test!Baek Seung Jo is the best!]

445
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:40,641
[Day of the exam]

446
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:43,433
Is it a cold? Do you have a cold?

447
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,003
Maybe...

448
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:47,000
I... I have medicine.

449
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,309
Just a sec...

450
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:55,604
This one is very effective. It's the best!

451
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,104
Here's some water!

452
00:30:57,104 --> 00:31:06,849
Thank you.

453
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,031
This doesn't cause drowsiness, right?

454
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:10,036
What?!

455
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:14,333
What?!

456
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:18,566
"Do not use in case of driving oractivities that require concentration."

457
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,866
Oh! It causes drowsiness!!

458
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,003
What to do?!Spit it out.

459
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:27,295
Hey, what are you doing?!Everything you do is like this anyway.

460
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:32,333
It'll be alright, since you're strong!

461
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,008
Wait!

462
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:35,009
You guys have to take your packed lunches.

463
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:38,962
Filled with nutritious food I have...

464
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:42,087
...especially made "Exam Pass" lunches.

465
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,178
Thank you very much.

466
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:45,666
Thanks, Dad!

467
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,003
Thanks, man. When did you preparesomething like this?

468
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:50,969
That's right... Thank you very much.

469
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:53,533
Oh, it was no sweat.

470
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:56,866
Wise choice. Good luck!

471
00:31:56,866 --> 00:32:05,512
Yes.

472
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:07,513
FIGHTING!!

473
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:11,941
You thought well.Everyone likes it (the decision to take the test).

474
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:12,933
Nice boy.

475
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,081
Stop joking around.

476
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:17,005
Ah, fork...

477
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:20,015
Do you think I'm you?Why would I spear a random answer?

478
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:26,206
Ah, that's right. I measured yourcorn by my own bushel.

479
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,573
- How far are you going to follow me!?- Huh?

480
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:32,777
You're that way.

481
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:35,009
That's right... It's the opposite direction...

482
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:38,847
Go ahead.

483
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:43,933
I see...So our paths separate here.

484
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:49,533
Yeah... Baek Seung Jo needsto go on his own path.

485
00:32:49,533 --> 00:33:05,003
Good luck on your test! FIGHTING!

486
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:08,003
Aigoo, even so he went.

487
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,007
Yeah...

488
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:13,698
He's not my son, he's really a godsend...A godsend!

489
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:17,485
Up until yesterday, he was beingstubborn and saying he wouldn't take it...

490
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:27,966
...why all of the sudden...?

491
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,266
I feel uneasy...

492
00:33:31,266 --> 00:34:05,003
Something just makes me uneasy.

493
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,008
STUDENT! STUDENT!

494
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:12,033
There are only fifteen minutes left.

495
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,647

496
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:24,725
I took some cold medicine this morning...

497
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:44,266
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

498
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:48,366
It was totally scary!The people didn't even smile.

499
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:52,038
"Why must we accept you?"

500
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:55,466
Ahh... She was like a witch.

501
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:56,833
Did you do well on the exam?

502
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:00,101
- I don't know... I just took it.- Aigoo.

503
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:03,077
I think I screwed up the entrance exam...

504
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,691
What do I do!

505
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:12,133
Ha Ni, exams are already over so why areyou complaining? We don't even have class!

506
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,333
What have you been doing right now?

507
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,637
TADA!

508
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:18,000
You were putting on makeup?

509
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,001
Don't I totally look like Ga-In?(Brown Eyed Girls member)

510
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:27,547
Ireoda naega michyeo yeoriyeori chak...(singing Brown Eyed Girls' hit song, "Abracadabra")

511
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:29,944
Oh, here...

512
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:33,481
You even have fake eyelashes?

513
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,566
Would you like me to put them on for you?

514
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,515
Sit down! Sit down!

515
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:44,033
Ha Ni, even though you don't havedouble eyelids, your eyes are really big.

516
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:44,915
Close your eyes.

517
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:52,748
If you put some eyelashes on like this...

518
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:57,066
Wow! You look very pretty!Here, look in the mirror.

519
00:35:57,066 --> 00:36:01,000
Jackpot. Hey, Dok Go Min Ah, look.Her eyes look ten times bigger, don't they?

520
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,333
If they were ten times bigger,she would be a monster.

521
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,266
Should I put it on the other side too?

522
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:12,017
Here. Close your eyes.

523
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:17,008
Like this.

524
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,868
Hello!

525
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:21,004
Are you putting on makeup?

526
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,054
It's not makeup...

527
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:27,238
You have the guts to put on makeupafter ruining someone else's life?

528
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:27,866
Huh?

529
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:31,478
I heard you gave Seung Jo Oppa sleeping pillson the morning of the college entrance exam.

530
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:33,173
What?!

531
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:34,868
What do you mean?

532
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:40,000
I heard you gave him cold medicine this morning.

533
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,033
After taking those, he fell asleep and had tofill in all the answers right before the test was over.

534
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:48,007
What are you going to do about it? How are yougoing to take responsibility for what you've done?

535
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:49,826
Hey, Hong Jang Mi!!

536
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:54,138
Because of that, he might not be able to goto college, but you seem to only care about yourself.

537
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:57,007
Even like that, you still dare tosay that you like him?

538
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,793
Right?

539
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:20,135
I'm asking you!

540
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:21,966
It's okay, right?

541
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:24,429
You did well, right?

542
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,683
You're the Baek Seung Jo.

543
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:52,696
No way...Just because of the medicine?

544
00:37:52,696 --> 00:38:07,666
Tell me it isn't so, please.That there was nothing wrong.

545
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:13,158
Jae Eun Jung.

546
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,345
Relax.

547
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:24,733
Kim Su Ahn.

548
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:30,966
We still have time. Be strong.

549
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,803
Kids, in the next four daysyour scores will be out.

550
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:34,483
Yes.

551
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:36,882
Wherever you go, make sure you have your phones.

552
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,251
Yes.

553
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:48,633
Bong Joon Gu!

554
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:53,465
Oh.

555
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:56,005
Don't have that sad look on your face, okay?

556
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:58,833
I already have something planned for my life.

557
00:38:58,833 --> 00:38:59,685
Really?

558
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,117
Yes.

559
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:06,004
So, Ha Ni, even if your scores don'tcome out that good...don't worry.

560
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:09,066
I'll take care of you forever.

561
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:12,734
HUUUUUUUU...

562
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:15,759
Bong Joon Gu, that's enough.

563
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:17,166
She has Baek Seung Jo.

564
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,526
What did you say? Who did you say she has?

565
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:24,819
That cowardly guy can't make a girl happy.

566
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:28,009
Then what about you? What can you do for Ha Ni?

567
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:30,816
What?

568
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,006
An axe comb?

569
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:33,266
What did you just say? An axe comb?

570
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:37,001
Ah, be quiet! That's enough.

571
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,966
Ha Ni...

572
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:42,153
Fighting!

573
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:54,866
Be strong!

574
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:55,489
Why?

575
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:56,859
Nothing.

576
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:01,007
After seeing this, I'm wonderingif I really am a genius.

577
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:04,001
What's wrong, Seung Jo? You're scaring me.

578
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:08,033
You still have the interview,so you just have to do that.

579
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:12,023
Ah, should we drop the curtains for you? For getting into Tae San University with the highest score?

580
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:16,006
But honestly, with your skills, going toTae San University seems like a waste.

581
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:19,833
You should be going to some place like Harvard.

582
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:24,000
Anyway, you did well! Seung Jo, great job!

583
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,003
Hurray!

584
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:34,652
He did it!

585
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:36,232
Oh Ha Ni,

586
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:48,005
even after getting those scores,you say "hurray"?

587

Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

588
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:57,025
But how do I stop myself from being so happy!?

589
00:40:57,025 --> 00:41:03,055
Baek Seung Jo HURRAY! Korea HURRAY!

590
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:05,917
Ring... Ring...

591
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,017
Please... Ring...

592
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,883
It will ring. It will ring.

593
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,083
Please, help me.

594
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:16,883
It will ring.

595
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:19,693
Hello?

596
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:23,917
Yes.

597
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,217
This isn't the roast duck restaurant.

598
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,883
The number is 0292, but...

599
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:36,983
...this isn't the roast duck place.

600
00:41:36,983 --> 00:41:38,045
Hello?

601
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:39,058
Yes.

602
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:42,015
Yes, I am Oh Ha Ni.

603
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:43,035
Oh my!

604
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:45,323
Parang University?!

605
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:46,067
Is it right?

606
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:48,583
Really?

607
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:49,662
Wow, thank you!

608
00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:52,336
Thank you.

609
00:41:52,336 --> 00:41:53,617
What?

610
00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:54,989
Oh!

611
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:58,783
I applied for the social sciences major.

612
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,045
Not the apple department?

613
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:02,083
Huh?

614
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,483
Apple department?

615
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:09,015
There's something like that...

616
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:10,917
Surprise!

617
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,025
Baek Eun Jo!

618
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:20,883
Oh Ha Ni dummy!

619
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:23,216
Aiyoo!

620
00:42:23,216 --> 00:42:28,783
Baek Seung Jo is going toTae San University with the highest score...

621
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:46,883
What am I going to do if I don't get into college at all?

622
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:48,669
Oh, Min Ah.

623
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,095
I got into Parang University.

624
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:52,745
Really?

625
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:54,417
Did they call you?

626
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:55,883
Just now.

627
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:58,075
Wow, congratulations!

628
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,095
And you, Ha Ni?

629
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:02,065
Not yet.

630
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:04,075
The call will come.

631
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:05,883
Yes.

632
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,015
Thank you.

633
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:10,017
Just wait. Let's hang up.

634
00:43:10,017 --> 00:43:14,005
Okay. Ah, Min Ah.

635
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,095
Once again, super super congratulations.

636
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:47,936
You did well.

637
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:51,404
Why?

638
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:55,802
Someone like me doesn't have the right to eat.

639
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:57,871
Eat, eat!

640
00:43:57,871 --> 00:43:59,904
Everything will be alright.

641
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:02,488
It's over.

642
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:07,237
Today's the last day for acceptances to be revealed.

643
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:11,079
It's already 10:00.

644
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,371
I already knew I wouldn't make it.

645
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:16,048
That witch...

646
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:21,204
No, that scary professor has noreason to accept me.

647
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,571
But, I was still thinking I could possibly get in.

648
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:27,037
Hey, you can still go with the SATs.

649
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:29,304
You can still get into a couple of places with that.

650
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:38,371
My scores aren't that good.

651
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,737
Hello!

652
00:44:41,737 --> 00:44:44,737
Yes, it is me.

653
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:46,771
Parang University?

654
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,947
Hey, this...

655
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,483
It's you again, Baek Eun Jo!

656
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:52,637
What?

657
00:44:52,637 --> 00:44:55,571
Why did you call my name?

658
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,471
Oh my!

659
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,962
Hello.

660
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,504
Yes.

661
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:01,804
Yes, it is me.

662
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:04,637
I'm sorry, I thought it was a prank call.

663
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:08,211
Just now, another person gave up their enrollment.

664
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:11,471
Student Oh Ha Ni, youpassed as an additional acceptance.

665
00:45:11,471 --> 00:45:24,237
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!I will go, I will go, I will go!

666
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:38,971
Ah, hurray!

667
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:41,815
I think I really have good luck.

668
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:45,075
Because of the typhoon, kids couldn't go.That's why I got the chance.

669
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,417
What would I have done ifthe typhoon hadn't come?

670
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:49,672
Yeah.

671
00:45:49,672 --> 00:45:52,583
That's not it! It's because of my Bul Nak porridge.

672
00:45:52,583 --> 00:46:00,817
That's right. Correct.

673
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:05,817
Here's a present.

674
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:08,983
Ahjusshi (Seung Jo's father) picked it out.

675
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:15,346
It's nothing big.

676
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:16,783
Wow!

677
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:18,917
It's really beautiful.

678
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:20,617
Thank you!

679
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:21,264
Thank you.

680
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:24,164
For what?

681
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:27,597
And this is my present.

682
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:34,742
There's another one?

683
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:36,093
These are musical tickets.

684
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,764
I've never seen a musical before.

685
00:46:38,764 --> 00:46:42,033
It's this Saturday. Let's meet infront of the theater at 2:30.

686
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,897
You hold on to the tickets.

687
00:46:43,897 --> 00:46:45,064
You can't forget.

688
00:46:45,064 --> 00:46:47,093
What do you mean forget?

689
00:46:47,093 --> 00:47:06,093
Thank you.

690
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,083
Where are you?

691
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:10,093
Oh Ha Ni, you're in front of the theater, right?

692
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:14,097
What should I do? There's so much traffic.

693
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:17,311
There's no traffic!

694
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,711
Because it's Saturday...

695
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,028
Why don't you go on ahead

696
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:24,033
and leave one ticket at the booth.

697
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:35,597
Yes, I'll do that.

698
00:47:35,597 --> 00:47:36,764
Hello.

699
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:38,664
Could I leave one ticket with you?

700
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:46,264
Ah... Yes.

701
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:50,043
The idol of every Korean girl, the Crown Prince...

702
00:47:50,043 --> 00:48:22,053
Together with him, a new dream worldof the 21st century opens up to you now!

703
00:48:22,053 --> 00:48:36,455
So, 1996.

704
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,838
Ah, really!

705
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,497
I'm sorry.

706
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:44,764
>

707
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:48,063
>

708
00:48:48,063 --> 00:49:16,297
Pass!

709
00:49:16,297 --> 00:49:21,497
I don't remember from when it was.

710
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:26,053
When I started to keep thinking about you.

711
00:49:26,053 --> 00:49:31,053
Twice, the thoughts would come.

712
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:38,764
They kept getting bigger and I was a little surprised.

713
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:44,013
I kept thinking it could be nothing.

714
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:48,083
That it could be irrelevant feelings.

715
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:52,464
I'll keep you (keep you)

716
00:49:52,464 --> 00:50:00,033
It was awkward when I talked to you.

717
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:04,597
Ah...it hurts.

718
00:50:04,597 --> 00:50:09,397
Why? You want me to pinch them for you?

719
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:12,497
But, how did you come?

720
00:50:12,497 --> 00:50:15,097
How do you think I came?

721
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:15,053
How?

722
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:19,383
Eun Jo, your mom is a really good actress, huh?

723
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:23,964
You heard me on the phone right?"I'm in front of the theater, and I got stood up."

724
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:25,053
I have no one to see it with.

725
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:32,997
So, he said he got it and would come,that great Baek Seung Jo.

726
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:36,197
Should I just be an actress?

727
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:38,043
Was it really...

728
00:50:38,043 --> 00:50:40,564
...just because of your acting?

729
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:50,043
Huh?

730
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:54,714
Excuse me.

731
00:50:54,714 --> 00:51:03,003
You're going to do theinterview for Tae San University, right?

732
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:07,043
Why are you being like that too?

733
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:13,097
I don't get why peoplekeep saying college, college, college.

734
00:51:13,097 --> 00:51:17,264
You're smart because you have something to offer.

735
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:18,964
It has to be that way.

736
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:25,864
Well, if I say "find your dream,"it sounds huge, but...

737
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:28,013
...just have fun living.

738
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:29,297
Have fun.

739
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:33,073
Fun?

740
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:36,464
My grandma used to say that all the time.

741
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:40,564
"Ha Ni, have fun living, fun."

742
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,264
"You have fun and make others happy."

743
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:45,864
She said it'd be fine as long as I live like that.

744
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:47,033
Fun?

745
00:51:47,033 --> 00:52:00,071
If you come to Parang University,I'll make it fun for you.

746
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,677
Oh, it's so nervewracking.

747
00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:04,477
Just a bit more.

748
00:52:04,477 --> 00:52:08,777
No, no. This way, this way. To the left.

749
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:11,852
Just a bit, just a bit. Straight.

750
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:12,082
It's good, it's good!

751
00:52:12,082 --> 00:52:21,543
You got it! You got it!

752
00:52:21,543 --> 00:52:36,049
You got it!

753
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:38,811
Aren't you going to take it?

754
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:45,669
Would I have gotten it so I could play with it?

755
00:52:45,669 --> 00:52:47,877
Ha Ni! Ha Ni!

756
00:52:47,877 --> 00:52:51,076
Come here! Come here!

757
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:53,177
What are you doing?

758
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:55,377
You guys went to a musical?

759
00:52:55,377 --> 00:52:57,735
Think I'll go crazy.

760
00:52:57,735 --> 00:53:00,009
Ha Ni, did he make a move on you?

761
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,705
Make a move?

762
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:05,878
I mean like while you guys were eating popcorn,doing hand motions like this or...

763
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:09,832
When watching a musical, you don't eat popcorn.

764
00:53:09,832 --> 00:53:13,146
Oh, really? Then what do you eat?

765
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:14,221
Oh!

766
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:17,091
Did you buy a doll? Wow, it even talks.

767
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:22,573
This... Seung Jo got it for me,from that doll vending machine.

768
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:23,003
What?

769
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:25,838
He gave it to me as a congratulatorygift for getting into college.

770
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:27,689
Congratulatory gift?

771
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:32,897
He gave you such cheap trash?Hey, Baek Seung Jo, are you making fun of Ha Ni?

772
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:38,011
What's wrong with this? And he got it himself.

773
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,685
Hey! You know how difficultdoll vending machines are.

774
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:43,443
Ha Ni, what's hard about that?

775
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:46,011
Stuff like that, anyone can do it.

776
00:53:46,011 --> 00:53:48,287
Really?

777
00:53:48,287 --> 00:53:55,792
This was my first time seeing it.

778
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:56,076
Wow.

779
00:53:56,076 --> 00:54:00,375
Hey! Hey, did you see it!? It was totally cool!

780
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:11,412
Here... Here...Watch this.

781
00:54:11,412 --> 00:54:28,727
You saw that?

782
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,615
Hey! Where are you going?

783
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:31,676
Look at this! Look at this!

784
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:36,041
Urgh really! Such a bother.

785
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:43,587
Here. Look, look, look, look!

786
00:54:43,587 --> 00:54:45,452
Urgh!!

787
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:59,407
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

788
00:54:59,407 --> 00:55:05,034
Hey look! That's not how it's done.

789
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:05,995
Ah!

790
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:30,097
Is this what I see a lot in movies?

791
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:32,248
Look at me.

792
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:36,035
Look in my eyes. In my eyes andin my heart, there is only you.

793
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:37,079
No.

794
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,737
I can't have both feelings in my heart.

795
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:46,474
Then I have no choice.Whether it's by using love or using strength,

796
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:51,601
I have to make you love me.

797
00:55:51,601 --> 00:56:03,334
Leave her alone.

798
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:05,943
No, please don't.

799
00:56:05,943 --> 00:56:07,279
If you do, I will be scared for you.

800
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:13,333
A coward can die many times,but a real man can only die once.

801
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:19,043
If I die for you, that is not my death...

802
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:56,041
...it is love.

803
00:56:56,041 --> 00:57:08,866
No!

804
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:14,874
Un Deux, Un Deux, Un Deux (One, Two).

805
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:32,898
What?

806
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:36,041
Son, do well! Fighting!

807
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:43,443
Even if someone is rude to you, just let it be.

808
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:47,441
Do...do your best.

809
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:49,749
Good luck, Hyung. Fighting!

810
00:57:49,749 --> 00:58:10,844
Right.

811
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:14,051
After making me upset over goingand not going, it's all over now.

812
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:18,092
Ah, this is so sad! Why must they gothrough all of this at such a beautiful age?

813
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:30,075
You got married at that age.

814
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:41,028
Why are they going on andon about college? I just don't get it.

815
00:58:41,028 --> 00:58:41,677
Ha Ni!

816
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:43,043
Where are you going?

817
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:53,318
This isn't going to work. My heart won't stop racing.I'll just keep an eye on him until he goes into the exam hall.

818
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:57,071
This is worrisome.

819
00:58:57,071 --> 01:00:15,965
Worrisome.

820
01:00:15,965 --> 01:00:17,915
Hey, did you see that?That car totally hit someone!

821
01:00:17,915 --> 01:01:00,324
It looks like it hit a girl.

822
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,437
She's waking up.

823
01:01:01,437 --> 01:01:03,652
Ha Ni!

824
01:01:03,652 --> 01:01:08,056
Aigoo! My daughter! Aigoo!

825
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:10,889
Dad.

826
01:01:10,889 --> 01:01:12,622
Where is this place?

827
01:01:12,622 --> 01:01:14,394
It's the hospital.

828
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:20,122
You were in a traffic accident.Don't you remember?

829
01:01:20,122 --> 01:01:21,847
You pooong...

830
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:24,666
I remember.

831
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:25,369
What about Seung Jo?

832
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:31,778
He went to take the test, of course.

833
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:34,047
That's a relief.

834
01:01:34,047 --> 01:01:50,976
You came?

835
01:01:50,976 --> 01:02:07,848
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

836
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:10,091
Is Ha Ni still being like that?

837
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:11,322
Are you running away?

838
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:14,085
Then, bye.

839
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:17,012
Please take me in, Father!

840
01:02:17,012 --> 01:02:19,096
Can you please teach me? Please, Father...

841
01:02:19,096 --> 01:02:25,648
It was fun. What could happen today...

842
01:02:25,648 --> 01:02:27,042
So?

843
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:36,121
Baek Seung Jo?!

844
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:37,723
Oh Ha Ni, come here.

845
01:02:37,723 --> 01:02:41,926
That brat. He's going to make noodles.Why do you like someone like that?

846
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:45,091
Oh Ha Ni!

847
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:47,173
You come here.

848
01:02:47,173 --> 01:02:49,031
That hurts!

849
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,667
When I go to college I'll find someone else...

850
01:02:50,667 --> 99:59:59,999
Then try to forget me.

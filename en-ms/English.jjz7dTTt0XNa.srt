1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I spent the best part of last year

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
working on a documentary

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
about my own happiness --

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
trying to see

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
if I can actually train my mind

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
in a particular way,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like I can train my body,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so I can end up with an improved feeling

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of overall well-being.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then this January,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
my mother died,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and pursuing a film like that

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So in a very typical, silly designer fashion,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
after years worth of work,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
(Music)

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They were still done

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was a little bit too funky,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and we wanted a more feminine point of view

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and employed a duck

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
who did it in a much more fitting way --

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
fashion.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My studio in Bali

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and monkeys, of course,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to lay out them properly.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can see,

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The serif is not really in place.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So of course, what you don't do properly yourself

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
is never deemed done really.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So this is us climbing onto the trees

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and putting it up over the Sayan Valley

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
in Indonesia.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In that year, what I did do a lot

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
was look at all sorts of surveys,

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
looking at a lot of data on this subject.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And it turns out

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that men and women

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
report very, very similar levels of happiness.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is a very quick overview

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of all the studies that I looked at.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That climate plays no role.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That if you live in the best climate,

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in San Diego in the United States,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
you are going to be just as happy

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in either place.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
any salary increase you're going to experience

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
will have only a tiny, tiny influence

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
on your overall well-being.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Black people are just as happy as white people are.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you're old or young

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it doesn't really make a difference.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
it makes no difference whatsoever.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You will adapt to it and get used to it.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you have manageable health problems

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
it doesn't really matter.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now this does matter.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So now the woman on the right

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
is actually much happier than the guy on the left --

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and you have meaningful friendships,

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that does make a lot of difference.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
than if you are single.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
came up with this beautiful little analogy

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
between the conscious and the unconscious mind.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
on this giant elephant, the unconscious.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And the rider thinks

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that he can tell the elephant what to do,

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but the elephant really has his own ideas.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If I look at my own life,

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm born in 1962 in Austria.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier,

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the big decisions in my life would have been made for me --

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I would have very much likely

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
entered the same profession that my dad did;

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and I would have very much likely married a woman

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that my mom had selected.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I, of course, and all of us,

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
are very much in charge

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
of these big decisions in our lives.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We live where we want to be --

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
at least in the West.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We become what we really are interested in.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We choose our own profession,

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and we choose our own partners.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And so it's quite surprising

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that many of us

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
let our unconscious influence those decisions

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in ways that we are not quite aware of.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you look at the statistics

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and you see that the guy called George,

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
when he decides on where he wants to live --

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is it Florida or North Dakota? --

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
he goes and lives in Georgia.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And if you look at a guy called Dennis,

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
when he decides what to become --

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
or a teacher? --

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And if Paula decides

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
should she marry Joe or Jack,

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And so even if we make

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
those very important decisions

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
for very silly reasons,

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it remains statistically true

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
that there are more Georges living in Georgia

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and there are more Dennises becoming dentists

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
than statistically viable.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
(Laughter)

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now I, of course, thought,

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
"Well this is American data,"

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They get influenced by things

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that they're not aware of.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is just completely ridiculous."

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad --

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
(Laughter)

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Karolina and Karl,

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and grandmom and granddad,

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Josefine and Josef.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I am looking still for a Stephanie.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll figure something out.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and see what makes me happy as a designer,

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the easiest answer, of course,

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
is do more of the stuff that I like to do

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do --

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
for which it would be helpful

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
to know what it is that I actually do like to do.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm a big list maker,

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so I came up with a list.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
One of them is to think without pressure.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a project we're working on right now

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with a very healthy deadline.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a book on culture,

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and, as you can see,

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
culture is rapidly drifting around.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Doing things like I'm doing right now --

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
traveling to Cannes.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The example I have here

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is a chair that came out of the year in Bali --

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
not being stuck behind

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
a single computer screen all day long

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and be here and there.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Quite consciously, design projects

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
that need an incredible amount of various techniques,

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
just basically to fight

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
straightforward adaptation.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Being close to the content --

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that's the content really is close to my heart.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is a bus, or vehicle,

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for a charity, for an NGO

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
that wants to double the education budget in the United States --

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
carefully designed,

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well,

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
like this little business card for an animation company

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
called Sideshow

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
on lenticular foils.

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Working on projects

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that actually have visible impacts,

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
like a book for a deceased German artist

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
whose widow came to us

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
with the requirement to make her late husband famous.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It just came out six months ago,

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I think that his widow

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
is going to be very successful on her quest.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And lately, to be involved in projects

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
where I know about 50 percent of the project

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
technique-wise

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and the other 50 percent would be new.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So in this case,

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
it's an outside projection for Singapore

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
on these giant Times Square-like screens.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer,

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
about typography,

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I didn't quite know

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
all that much about movement or film.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But also because the content was very close.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In this case, "Keeping a Diary

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Supports Personal Development" --

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I've found that it influenced my life and work

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
in a very intriguing way.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
In this case also because

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
it's part of one of the many sentiments

206
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that we build the whole series on --

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Thank you so much.

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
(Applause)

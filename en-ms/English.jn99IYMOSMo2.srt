1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,220
In this video we're going
to get introduced to the

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:14,190
Pythagorean theorem,
which is fun on its own.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,930
But you'll see as you learn
more and more mathematics it's

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,570
one of those cornerstone
theorems of really all of math.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,920
It's useful in geometry,
it's kind of the backbone

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,750
of trigonometry.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,200
You're also going to use
it to calculate distances

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,510
between points.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,810
So it's a good thing to really
make sure we know well.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,570
So enough talk on my end.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,320
Let me tell you what the
Pythagorean theorem is.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,290
So if we have a triangle, and
the triangle has to be a right

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,110
triangle, which means that one
of the three angles in the

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,520
triangle have to be 90 degrees.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,580
And you specify that it's
90 degrees by drawing that

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,930
little box right there.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,830
So that right there is-- let
me do this in a different

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,550
color-- a 90 degree angle.

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,930
Or, we could call
it a right angle.

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,390
And a triangle that has
a right angle in it is

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,850
called a right triangle.

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,700
So this is called
a right triangle.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,440
Now, with the Pythagorean
theorem, if we know two sides

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,980
of a right triangle we can
always figure out

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,920
the third side.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,310
And before I show you how to
do that, let me give you one

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,560
more piece of terminology.

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,230
The longest side of a right
triangle is the side opposite

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,690
the 90 degree angle-- or
opposite the right angle.

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,650
So in this case it is
this side right here.

32
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,285
This is the longest side.

33
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:55,020
And the way to figure out where
that right triangle is, and

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,060
kind of it opens into
that longest side.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,150
That longest side is
called the hypotenuse.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,130

37
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,330
And it's good to know, because
we'll keep referring to it.

38
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,000
And just so we always are good
at identifying the hypotenuse,

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,560
let me draw a couple of
more right triangles.

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,090
So let's say I have a triangle
that looks like that.

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,390
Let me draw it a
little bit nicer.

42
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,130
So let's say I have a triangle
that looks like that.

43
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,010
And I were to tell you
that this angle right

44
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,390
here is 90 degrees.

45
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,860
In this situation this is the
hypotenuse, because it is

46
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,410
opposite the 90 degree angle.

47
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,880
It is the longest side.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,670
Let me do one more, just
so that we're good at

49
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,420
recognizing the hypotenuse.

50
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,050
So let's say that that is my
triangle, and this is the 90

51
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,790
degree angle right there.

52
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,710
And I think you know how
to do this already.

53
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,620
You go right what
it opens into.

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,530
That is the hypotenuse.

55
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,200
That is the longest side.

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,940

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,400
So once you have identified the
hypotenuse-- and let's say

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,050
that that has length C.

59
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,980
And now we're going to
learn what the Pythagorean

60
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,210
theorem tells us.

61
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,680
So let's say that C is equal to
the length of the hypotenuse.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,630
So let's call this
C-- that side is C.

63
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,910
Let's call this side
right over here A.

64
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,890
And let's call this
side over here B.

65
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,620
So the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that A squared-- so

66
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,880
the length of one of the
shorter sides squared-- plus

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,890
the length of the other shorter
side squared is going to

68
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,370
be equal to the length of
the hypotenuse squared.

69
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,740
Now let's do that with an
actual problem, and you'll see

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,820
that it's actually not so bad.

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
So let's say that I have a
triangle that looks like this.

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,050
Let me draw it.

73
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,210
Let's say this is my triangle.

74
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,160
It looks something like this.

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,560
And let's say that they tell us
that this is the right angle.

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,940
That this length right here--
let me do this in different

77
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,830
colors-- this length right
here is 3, and that this

78
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,170
length right here is 4.

79
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,490
And they want us to figure
out that length right there.

80
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,130
Now the first thing you want to
do, before you even apply the

81
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,660
Pythagorean theorem, is to
make sure you have your

82
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,710
hypotenuse straight.

83
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,350
You make sure you know
what you're solving for.

84
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,120
And in this circumstance we're
solving for the hypotenuse.

85
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,440
And we know that because this
side over here, it is the side

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,310
opposite the right angle.

87
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,540
If we look at the Pythagorean
theorem, this is C.

88
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,160
This is the longest side.

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,920
So now we're ready to apply
the Pythagorean theorem.

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,070
It tells us that 4 squared--
one of the shorter sides-- plus

91
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,260
3 squared-- the square of
another of the shorter sides--

92
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,080
is going to be equal to this
longer side squared-- the

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,590
hypotenuse squared-- is going
to be equal to C squared.

94
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,310
And then you just solve for C.

95
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,380
So 4 squared is the same
thing as 4 times 4.

96
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,460
That is 16.

97
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,910
And 3 squared is the same
thing as 3 times 3.

98
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,810
So that is 9.

99
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,580
And that is going to be
equal to C squared.

100
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,610
Now what is 16 plus 9?

101
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,480
It's 25.

102
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,195
So 25 is equal to C squared.

103
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:29,020
And we could take the positive
square root of both sides.

104
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,960
I guess, just if you look at
it mathematically, it could

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,160
be negative 5 as well.

106
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,870
But we're dealing with
distances, so we only care

107
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,050
about the positive roots.

108
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,170
So you take the principal
root of both sides and

109
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,280
you get 5 is equal to C.

110
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,260
Or, the length of the
longest side is equal to 5.

111
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,640
Now, you can use the
Pythagorean theorem, if we give

112
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,620
you two of the sides, to figure
out the third side no matter

113
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,690
what the third side is.

114
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,300
So let's do another
one right over here.

115
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:10,670
Let's say that our
triangle looks like this.

116
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,610
And that is our right angle.

117
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,820
Let's say this side over here
has length 12, and let's say

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,080
that this side over
here has length 6.

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,210
And we want to figure out this
length right over there.

120
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,870
Now, like I said, the first
thing you want to do is

121
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,350
identify the hypotenuse.

122
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,130
And that's going to be the side
opposite the right angle.

123
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,550
We have the right angle here.

124
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,650
You go opposite
the right angle.

125
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,460
The longest side, the
hypotenuse, is right there.

126
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,100
So if we think about the
Pythagorean theorem-- that A

127
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,820
squared plus B squared is
equal to C squared-- 12

128
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,220
you could view as C.

129
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,740
This is the hypotenuse.

130
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,670
The C squared is the
hypotenuse squared.

131
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,030
So you could say
12 is equal to C.

132
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,880
And then we could say that
these sides, it doesn't matter

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,580
whether you call one of
them A or one of them B.

134
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,970
So let's just call
this side right here.

135
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,990
Let's say A is equal to 6.

136
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,780
And then we say B-- this
colored B-- is equal

137
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,640
to question mark.

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,070
And now we can apply the
Pythagorean theorem.

139
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:25,940
A squared, which is 6 squared,
plus the unknown B squared is

140
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,330
equal to the hypotenuse
squared-- is equal

141
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,760
to C squared.

142
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,250
Is equal to 12 squared.

143
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,260
And now we can solve for B.

144
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,370
And notice the difference here.

145
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,110
Now we're not solving
for the hypotenuse.

146
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,210
We're solving for one
of the shorter sides.

147
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,790
In the last example we
solved for the hypotenuse.

148
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,790
We solved for C.

149
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,570
So that's why it's always
important to recognize that A

150
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,190
squared plus B squared plus C
squared, C is the length

151
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,670
of the hypotenuse.

152
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,850
So let's just solve for B here.

153
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:59,280
So we get 6 squared is 36,
plus B squared, is equal

154
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,700
to 12 squared-- this
12 times 12-- is 144.

155
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,550
Now we can subtract 36 from
both sides of this equation.

156
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,420

157
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,270
Those cancel out.

158
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,510
On the left-hand side we're
left with just a B squared

159
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,410
is equal to-- now 144
minus 36 is what?

160
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,000
144 minus 30 is 114.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,080
And then you
subtract 6, is 108.

162
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,910
So this is going to be 108.

163
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,630
So that's what B squared is,
and now we want to take the

164
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,600
principal root, or the
positive root, of both sides.

165
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,430
And you get B is equal
to the square root, the

166
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,650
principal root, of 108.

167
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,550
Now let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

168
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,550
The square root of 108.

169
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,930
And what we could do is
we could take the prime

170
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,670
factorization of 108
and see how we can

171
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,410
simplify this radical.

172
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:07,590
So 108 is the same thing as 2
times 54, which is the same

173
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:15,570
thing as 2 times 27, which is
the same thing as 3 times 9.

174
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,780
So we have the square root of
108 is the same thing as the

175
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,550
square root of 2 times 2
times-- well actually,

176
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,520
I'm not done.

177
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,760
9 can be factorized
into 3 times 3.

178
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,170
So it's 2 times 2 times
3 times 3 times 3.

179
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,820
And so, we have a couple of
perfect squares in here.

180
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,680
Let me rewrite it a
little bit neater.

181
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,160
And this is all an exercise in
simplifying radicals that you

182
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,200
will bump into a lot while
doing the Pythagorean theorem,

183
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,460
so it doesn't hurt to
do it right here.

184
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:55,820
So this is the same thing as
the square root of 2 times 2

185
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,790
times 3 times 3 times the
square root of that last

186
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,510
3 right over there.

187
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,090
And this is the same thing.

188
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,785
And, you know, you wouldn't
have to do all of

189
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,960
this on paper.

190
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,970
You could do it in your head.

191
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,530
What is this?

192
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,780
2 times 2 is 4.

193
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,200
4 times 9, this is 36.

194
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,030
So this is the square root of
36 times the square root of 3.

195
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,610
The principal root of 36 is 6.

196
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,380
So this simplifies to
6 square roots of 3.

197
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,730
So the length of B, you could
write it as the square root of

198
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,040
108, or you could say it's
equal to 6 times the

199
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
square root of 3.

200
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,150
This is 12, this is 6.

201
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,580
And the square root of 3,
well this is going to be a 1

202
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,600
point something something.

203
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
So it's going to be a
little bit larger than 6.

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,512

1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,130
In the completing the square
video I kept saying that all

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,810
the quadratic equation is
completing the square

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,450
as kind of a short cut
of completing square.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,220
And I was under the impression
that I had done this

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,120
proof already but now I
realize that I haven't.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,750
So let me prove the quadratic
equation to you, by

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,690
completing the square.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,210
So let's say I have a
quadratic equation.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,870
I guess a quadratic equation is
actually what you're trying to

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,760
solve, and what a lot of people
call the quadratic equation is

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,960
actually the quadratic formula.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,100
But anyway I don't want to get
caught up in terminology.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,030
But let's say that I have
a quadratic equation that

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:46,450
says ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0.

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,280
And let's just complete
the square here.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,480
So how do we do that?

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,940
Well let's subtract c from both
sides so we get ax squared plus

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,740
the bx is equal to minus c.

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,040
And just like I said in the
completing the square video

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,200
I don't like having this
a coefficient here.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,355
I like just having one
coefficient on my x squared

22
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:10,980
term so let me divide
everything by a.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:21,440
So I get x squared plus b/a
x is equal to-- you have

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,695
to divide both sides
by a --minus c/a.

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,600
Now we are ready to
complete the square.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,890
What was completing the square?

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,790
Well it's somehow adding
something to this expression so

28
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,590
it has the form of something
that is the square

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,140
of an expression.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,940
What do i mean by that?

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,400
Well, I'll do a
little aside here.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,950
if I told you that x plus
a squared, that equals

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,500
x squared plus two ax
plus a squared, right?

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,330
So if I can add something here
so that this left hand side

35
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,810
this expression looks like
this, then I could

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,330
go the other way.

37
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,690
I can say this is going to be
x plus something squared.

38
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,590
So what do I have to
add on both sides?

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,140
If you watched the completing
the square video this should be

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,730
hopefully intuitive for you.

41
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,510
What you do is you say well
this b/a, this corresponds to

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,183
the 2a term, so a is going to
be half of this, is going to

43
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,010
be half of this coefficient.

44
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,100
That would be the a.

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,620
And then what I need
to add is a squared.

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,930
So I need to take half of
this and then square it and

47
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,110
then add it to both sides.

48
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,865
Let me do that in a
different color.

49
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,810
Do it in this magenta.

50
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,650
So I'm going to take half of
this-- I'm just completing

51
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,100
square, that's all I'm doing,
no magic here --so

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,450
plus half of this.

53
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,230
Well half of that
is b/2a right?

54
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,130
You just multiply by 1/2.

55
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,240
And I have to square it.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,893
Well if I did it to the left
hand side of the equation, I

57
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,660
have to do it to the
right hand side.

58
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,206
So plus b/2a squared.

59
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,670
And now I have this left hand
side of the equation in the

60
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,750
form that it is the square of
an expression that is

61
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,950
x plus something.

62
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,880
And what is it?

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,970
Well that's equal to-- let me
switch colors again --what's

64
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,730
the left hand side of
this equation equal to?

65
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,520
And you can just use this
pattern and go to the left.

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,730
It's x plus what?

67
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,960
Well we said a, you can do one
of two ways. a is 1/2 of this

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,390
coefficient or a is the square
root of this coefficient or

69
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,310
since we didn't even square it
we know that this

70
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,970
is a. b/2a is a.

71
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:49,060
So this is the same thing as x
plus b over 2a everything

72
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,980
squared, and then that equals--
let's see if we can simplify

73
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,230
this or make this a little
bit cleaner --that equals--

74
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,760
See, if I were to have a common
denominator-- I'm just doing a

75
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,600
little bit of algebra here
--see, when I square this it's

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,780
going to be 4a squared--
let me let me write this.

77
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,740
This is equal to b
squared over 4a squared.

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,710
Right?

79
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,860
And so if I have to add these
two fractions, let me make

80
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:29,550
this equal to 4a squared.

81
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,330
Right?

82
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,750
And if the denominator is
4a squared, what does

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,360
the minus c/a become?

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,280
I See if I multiply the
denominator by 4a, I have to

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,810
multiply the numerator by 4a.

86
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:50,090
So this becomes
minus 4ac, right?

87
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,030
And then b squared over
4a squared, well that's

88
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,810
just still b squared.

89
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,520
I'm just doing a little
bit of algrebra.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Hopefully I'm not
confusing you.

91
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,470
I just expanded this.

92
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,330
I just took the square of this,
b squared over 4a squared.

93
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,790
And then I added this to this,
I got a common denominator.

94
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,710
And minus c/a is the same thing
as minus 4ac over 4a squared.

95
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,570
And now we can take the
square root of both

96
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,240
sides of this equation.

97
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,760
And this should hopefully
start to look a little

98
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,490
bit familiar to you now.

99
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,290
So let's see, so we get x.

100
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,080
So if we take the square root
of both sides of this equation

101
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:29,780
we get x plus b/2a is equal to
the square root of this-- let's

102
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,180
take the square root of the
numerator and the demoninator.

103
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,950
So the numerator is-- I'm going
to put the b squared first, I'm

104
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,110
just going to switch this
order, it doesn't matter --the

105
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,660
square root of b squared
minus 4ac, right?

106
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,440
That's just the numerator.

107
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,240
I just the square root of it,
and we have to get the square

108
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,770
root of the denominator too.

109
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,970
What's the square
roof of 4a squared?

110
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,020
Well it's just 2a, right?

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,950
2a.

112
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,800
And now what do we do?

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Oh, it's very important!

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400
When we're taking the square
root, it's not just the

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,070
positive square root.

116
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,450
It's the positive or
minus square root.

117
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,600
We saw that couple of times
when we did the-- and you could

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,090
say it's a plus or minus here
too, but if you look plus or

119
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,800
minus on the top and a plus or
minus on the bottom, you can

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,290
just write it once on the top.

121
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,930
I'll let you think about why
you only have to write it once.

122
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,560
If you had a negative an a
plus, or negative and a plus

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,250
sometimes cancel out, or a
negative and a negative,

124
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,790
that's the same thing as
just having a plus on top.

125
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,210
Anyway, I think you get that.

126
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,140
And now we just have to
subtract b/2a from both sides.

127
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:33,680
and we get, we get-- and this
is the exciting part --we get x

128
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:42,850
is equal to minus be over to 2a
plus or minus this thing, so

129
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:51,790
minus b squared minus 4ac,
all of that over 2a.

130
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,850
And we already have a common
denominator, so we can

131
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,130
just add the fractions.

132
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,880
So we got --and I'm going to do
this in a vibrant bold-- I

133
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,570
don't know maybe not so much
bold, well green color --so we

134
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:10,970
get x is equal to, numerator,
negative b plus or minus square

135
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:19,470
root of b squared minus
4ac, all of that over 2a.

136
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,010
And that is the famous
quadratic formula.

137
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,480
So, there we go we proved it.

138
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,410
And we proved it just from
completing the square.

139
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,570
I hope you found that
vaguely interesting.

140
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,450
See in the next Video.

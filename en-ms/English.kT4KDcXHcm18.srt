1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In fact, mostly now in other things.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One thing is distant relationships among human languages.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
groupings that go back a long time,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
longer than the familiar families.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and I would love to see where that leads.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Does it really lead to a single ancestor

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
some 20, 25,000 years ago?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
when there was presumably a competition among many languages?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You may just know more about everything than anyone.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000

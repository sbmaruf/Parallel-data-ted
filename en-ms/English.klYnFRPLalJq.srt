1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:05,000
Goo JoonPyo!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,072
Hey you again!

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,088
I told you there's a connection between us.

4
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:12,048
I just knew that if I came by your house, I would be able to see you.

5
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:15,004
Did you boil your cell phone or something?

6
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,068
You are supposed to call and get permission from the owner before comming to visit someone's house.

7
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:22,012
Don't you know that?

8
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,096
I'm tired.

9
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:27,044
Come to think of it, I don't remember learning anything like that.

10
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,004
JoonPyo, how about you?

11
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:31,116
Hey, monkey!

12
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:32,096
Aren't you getting up?

13
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:36,088
Why are you lying on my bed?

14
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:40,000
Get up, hurry.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,064
Get up, hurry!

16
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:43,052
Get up!

17
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:49,028
get up!

18
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:53,052
do you want to make a bet with me?

19
00:00:53,052 --> 00:01:06,002
what kind of bet?

20
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:12,016
Oh! No, no, no!

21
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,088
Please win.

22
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:24,004
Please win!

23
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:29,064
I'll let you try again.

24
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:40,052
Please win!

25
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:43,044
I won again!How come you can never win?

26
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:47,032
I'm not playing this anymore!

27
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:51,044
Play it yourself. What is this???

28
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:59,012
Hey!

29
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:00,064
Stop drinking that.

30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,076
It's going to hinder your recovery.

31
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:06,008
Recovery?

32
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,008
What does it matter if I don't get better soon?

33
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,046
So what if it's hindering me from making a few bowls?

34
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:16,072
I am probably going to continue living as a womanizer.

35
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:19,096
Aren't I?

36
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:27,084
YiJung, until now, you've been doing well. Why are you being like this?

37
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:30,016
Young master.

38
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,664
Your mother has again . . .

39
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:35,088
What happened?

40
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,012
She's doing okay at the hospital, but . . .

41
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:42,072
She is asking for you, young master.

42
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:51,098
Tell her I'm busy.

43
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:54,078
Where are you going?

44
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:56,088
If you don't want to see me go crazy,

45
00:02:56,088 --> 00:03:12,032
Leave me alone.

46
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:15,058
GaEul.

47
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:19,034
You said you wanted to go on a date with me, right?

48
00:03:19,034 --> 00:05:24,088
Is that offer still good?

49
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:37,016
If you want to walk away like this, then you shouldn't have asked me for a date.

50
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:54,056
The highlight of the night has yet to come.

51
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:56,076
Did you say your name is GaEul?

52
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:59,084
Take your time and enjoy the food.

53
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:03,092
The foie gras (duck) here is the best.

54
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:07,088
Thank you.

55
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:10,002
It seems that you like GaEul.

56
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:15,064
Of course, how can I not like a cute young lady like GaEul?

57
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:21,012
I guess I'm just like you after all.

58
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:25,052
The mother is in the hospital, but the son is out on a date instead of being there.

59
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:31,006
You don't care if your wife is alive or dead,

60
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:34,072
but you dine on fois gras with a young lady.

61
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:40,002
I guess the apple really doesn't fall that far from the tree does it?

62
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:43,092
Let's talk about our family later.

63
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:46,004
Then what should we talk about?

64
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:50,076
You seem to take a liking to this lady, shall I lend her to you?

65
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,076
Yijung sunbae.

66
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,092
Why are you so formal and proper?

67
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:58,004
She's about the same age as your former girlfriend.

68
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,088
What do you think, GaEul?

69
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:09,048
Is my father okay for you?

70
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:21,008
Please, excuse me.

71
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:40,064
Today, you were the one who went overboard, my son.

72
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:42,064
Why are we here?

73
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:46,032
The loser needs to shut his mouth. Did you forget the wager?

74
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,738
You agreed to be my servant today.

75
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:50,056
When did I?

76
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:54,092
Wow! What I really hate is someone who goes back on their word.

77
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:58,028
Have you heard a man's word is as good as blood?

78
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,004
A man's word is as good as a blond?

79
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:05,026
Don't talk, just follow me.

80
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:10,004
A man's word is as good as a blond?

81
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:40,088
Oh! Haha, that?

82
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:43,076
Why are you buying so much?

83
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:46,012
Hey! Hey! Hey!

84
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:59,088
Hey...

85
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,881
I am going to eat one.

86
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:03,046
I don't want to eat.

87
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:06,044
Just try once.

88
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:36,056
It's yummy, isn't it?

89
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,032
Your wife is really gorgeous.

90
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:41,000
You two look good together.

91
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,056
Thank you.

92
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:45,096
Did you hear that? Did you hear that? He said I'm pretty.

93
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:49,366
You really buy that?

94
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,058
Thank you. He's just trying to sell this thing we're eating.

95
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,001
It's not like that. No!

96
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,002
No, he's not!

97
00:09:54,002 --> 00:10:07,004
Thank you. Hey!

98
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,048
Hey, monkey. This is . . .

99
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,032
Jan Di moved to a new house.

100
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:37,028
She's living alone with her brother. I was concerned. So,I went to see her.

101
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,048
Here.

102
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:42,052
I've been on the receiving end of things again.

103
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:48,978
Today, I got something in return, too.

104
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,076
Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea?

105
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:59,000
At least, I can offer you warm green tea.

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:13,076
Ah, grandfather, ah, h - he has already gone home.

107
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:53,004
Wait for a moment. I'll just prepare the tea.

108
00:11:53,004 --> 00:12:00,292
<i>"Thank you, doctor grandpa."</i>

109
00:12:00,292 --> 00:13:16,064
<i>Doctor grandfather, thank you.</i>

110
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:17,006
<i>Are you having fun, JiHoo?</i>

111
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:19,048
Yeah, grandpa!

112
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,048
Let's go fishing!

113
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:25,076
I'll catch a gigantic shark.

114
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:30,028
Fishing? Okay JiHoo, when should we go?

115
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:32,004
Right now.

116
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:42,068
Okay, let's go.

117
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:46,054
Wow, it smells so good.

118
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,014
Me first!!

119
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:51,064
How dare you? You're going to eat it all in the blink of an eye.

120
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,066
What?

121
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,088
Little bro, this girl is a glutton. Hurry up and eat.

122
00:13:55,088 --> 00:14:00,048
That can't be, of course. Whose money was used to buy all this?

123
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,024
Hey! That's it for you!

124
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:06,028
Hey! Hey!

125
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:16,008
Hey!

126
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,008
Why aren't you eating?

127
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:21,012
Because I'm tired of always only eat ramen.

128
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:24,068
What do you want to eat besides ramen?

129
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:26,052
Pizza!

130
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:29,084
I wouldn't have any other wishes if I could eat pizza the whole day.

131
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:38,068
What a small wish!

132
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,024
Ah! Don't eat!

133
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:50,088
You should eat something good.

134
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:53,004
Ah! I'm so full.

135
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:58,002
By the way, why isn't JanDi home yet?

136
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:01,024
Little brother, try calling.

137
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,048
Sister doesn't have a cellphone.

138
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:05,006
What?! She doesn't have a cellphone anymore?

139
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:12,092
She gave it to my parents when they left, for emergency.

140
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:15,056
You guys are really . . .

141
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:23,012
Oh, I see . . .

142
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,064
Let's go!

143
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:27,016
Where to?

144
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:33,012
What?

145
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:40,008
Come quick!

146
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:43,072
I will take this. You mean this product?

147
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,002
Just a moment please.

148
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,028
It was this! This is what I told you!

149
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:47,094
Mister, please let me have a look at this.

150
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,032
Oh, that's what I want!

151
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:54,028
Oh, sorry. We came first.

152
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:55,096
Yo! CEO!

153
00:15:55,096 --> 00:16:01,068
Guess you are not just CEO for show.Good job, boy!

154
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:11,002
Excuse me, the one that I was talking about earlier on.

155
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:20,076
JiHoo.

156
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:22,084
Excuse me.

157
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:24,068
JiHoo!

158
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:28,096
I was wrong.

159
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:33,072
What are you talking about? It was all my fault.

160
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:37,092
I killed your beloved son and daughter-in-law,

161
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:41,016
and survived alone.

162
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,021
You probably hated me.

163
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:46,096
It wasn't your fault.

164
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:49,096
It was my fault.

165
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:52,028
JiHoo!

166
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:54,048
15 years . . .

167
00:16:54,048 --> 00:17:00,096
You should have said that 15 years ago.

168
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:04,008
Do you know?

169
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:07,044
That child . . .

170
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:09,068
How long . . .

171
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:12,024
That child waited for his grandfather?

172
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,044
JiHoo . . .

173
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:16,004
You didn't know, did you ?

174
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:18,024
That child . . .

175
00:17:18,024 --> 00:17:25,024
Do you know how much that child longed to cry in his grandfather's arms?

176
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:35,024
My grandson. . .

177
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:39,084
Please never call me that again.

178
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:44,002
JiHoo!

179
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:48,024
Grandfather!

180
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,076
Grandfather, Grandfather!

181
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:56,024
I'm fine. Follow him. Hurry.

182
00:17:56,024 --> 00:18:11,028
Go on.

183
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:15,008
JiHoo Sunbae!

184
00:18:15,008 --> 00:19:41,008
Jihoo Sunbae!

185
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:49,008
Grandfather!

186
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:51,044
Grandfather!

187
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:53,078
Grandfather!

188
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:56,096
Grandfather!

189
00:19:56,096 --> 00:22:52,096
Grandfather!

190
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:55,092
Because of me that kid may be crying.

191
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:59,032
I was scared.

192
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:02,048
Like father . . .

193
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:08,044
Like mother.

194
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:11,024
That kid may be crying because of me.

195
00:23:11,024 --> 00:27:31,000
I ran away.

196
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,068
What kind of girl comes home at this hour?

197
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:39,028
Ah. That is . . .

198
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:44,005
Why am I explaining myself? It's not like I've done anything wrong.

199
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:50,036
It's my life! You don't even know the word "privacy"?

200
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,068
Hey, Geum JanDi, if you want to say something, say it properly.

201
00:27:53,068 --> 00:28:00,016
It is not privacy but p-r-i-d-e. Do you not even know what pride is?

202
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:06,008
What?

203
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:10,008
Hey, where are you going when someone is talking to you?

204
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,028
Whether it is privacy or pride,

205
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:16,006
I am going to school to find out. What do you want?!

206
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:17,008
Hey!

207
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:20,032
You really aren't going to tell me what you have been doing and where?

208
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,006
I won't!

209
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:24,076
Really!

210
00:28:24,076 --> 00:30:28,000
Ah sheesh!

211
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,084
Is everything okay?

212
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:33,072
Yes.

213
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:35,000
What about JoonPyo?

214
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,828
He went to school.

215
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:38,076
How are things with JoonPyo and JaeKyung?

216
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:44,072
When you were not around, she came often and spent time with young master.

217
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:46,006
Oh, did she?

218
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:49,036
That's a relief.

219
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:56,048
By the way . . .

220
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:59,012
Do you have anything else to report to me?

221
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,064
Yes?

222
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:04,028
Secretary Jang,

223
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:09,716
I know that you are busy supporting our family in my place.

224
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:17,036
But both you and I know that JoonPyo is not the type of person to give up easily.

225
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:19,064
It is too early to think that he has given up on her.

226
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:37,048
Don't you think?

227
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:39,652
I am sorry.

228
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:43,076
It is my mistake to miss something like this.

229
00:31:43,076 --> 00:32:18,068
- Check it out right now. Yes, President.

230
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:21,814
What a pain this must be for you!

231
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,687
Why don't you just return to your old neighborhood?

232
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:27,036
I told you it's training for getting used to an independent and wild lifestyle.

233
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:33,036
But you go back there for every meal with your chauffeur, you even go back there to change your clothes..

234
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:36,032
Which part of that is "wild and independent?"

235
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:37,096
Sleeping! I spend the nights here.

236
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:44,000
I spend nights here in this tiny room where I can't even stretch my long legs out with roaches and all kinds of bugs.

237
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,056
Who told you to do that?

238
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,002
No one asked you to do that.

239
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:50,439
Don't make your life so difficult!

240
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:52,028
Are you really not going to tell me?

241
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:53,082
What?!

242
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,068
I, what . . .

243
00:32:55,068 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm not asking because I'm curious about your pride, or privacy.

244
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,004
It is because I am like your guardian . . .

245
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:05,491
Hey! Ah sheesh!

246
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:11,316
I'm not done talking to you.

247
00:33:11,316 --> 00:33:15,068
Hey!

248
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:17,036
Are you Geum KangSan?

249
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,006
Yes, I am Geum KangSan.

250
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:41,024
Please come this way.

251
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:48,052
"KangSan, cheer up ^^"

252
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:58,006
Enjoy it.

253
00:33:58,006 --> 00:34:02,012
I granted your wish. Now eat as much as you want.

254
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:15,084
JoonPyo hyungnim?

255
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:20,305
Is it good?

256
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,076
Eat a lot.

257
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:24,028
KangSan!

258
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:35,008
- Let me have some too! - Me too!

259
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:36,092
Welcome!

260
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:40,629
JiHoo Sunbae.

261
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,052
What brings you here?

262
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:46,044
I went to JanDi's house and . . .

263
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:49,028
Ah! You still don't know.

264
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:51,006
JanDi has already moved.

265
00:34:51,006 --> 00:35:04,012
She moved?

266
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:31,881
You guys eat a lot, too.

267
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:50,402
It bugs me even when he(JoonPyo) is too quiet.

268
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:52,048
Hey! Why aren't you turning on?

269
00:35:52,048 --> 00:36:06,018
Hey!

270
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:09,001
Secretary Jang, it's me.

271
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,088
I can't turn it on.

272
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:15,002
What can it be! I'm talking about the stove! The stove!

273
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:19,528
It doesn't turn on!

274
00:36:19,528 --> 00:37:31,016
Come here quickly and do something about this!

275
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:59,032
That was quick.

276
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:00,022
Let go! Ah sheesh!

277
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:02,009
Hey! I said let go!

278
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:07,098
Get your hands off of me!

279
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:09,062
Get your hands off of me!

280
00:38:09,062 --> 00:39:02,028
Hey, just let me go!

281
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:05,078
KangSan.

282
00:39:05,078 --> 00:39:20,092
Hey!

283
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:34,064
Who is it ?

284
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:39,439
Hello! Hey, yo!

285
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:47,004
Senior!

286
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:49,004
How did you guys find out?

287
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:54,008
We heard you moved, so we're here for a housewarming party.

288
00:39:54,008 --> 00:40:00,064
The owner of the house has to invite you for there to be a housewarming party.

289
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,088
But do the both of you really live is this kind of place?

290
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:06,084
It's better than it looks.

291
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:10,006
It is quiet and safe.

292
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:13,004
The rent is quite cheap.

293
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:21,024
Almost free!

294
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:26,028
But, JoonPyo . . .

295
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:32,016
Excuse me.

296
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:33,032
Who can it be?

297
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:36,056
Geum JanDi, you're pretty popular.

298
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:38,068
Hold on a minute.

299
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,038
Who is it?

300
00:40:40,038 --> 00:41:08,068
Who is it?

301
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,008
How did they get here?

302
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:16,016
I can hardly believe my eyes seeing you boys here at this late hour.

303
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,052
JoonPyo

304
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:18,082
is not here.

305
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:22,084
I know where my son is and what he is doing.

306
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:25,004
What is the reason that you're here?

307
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:32,028
Even a commoner like you, should know that it's etiquette to greet elders and ask them to come inside?

308
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:37,018
So I am saying that family education is important.

309
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:40,012
Then, would you like to come inside?

310
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,096
Forget it.

311
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:49,000
I prefer staying out here rather than stepping a foot inside.

312
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,016
I knew you weren't an average girl, but I guess you excel in seducing men. .

313
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:56,096
Chairwoman, it's not that but . . .

314
00:41:56,096 --> 00:42:00,000
If I'm wrong about this misunderstanding,

315
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,008
Then please, tell me what your excuse is.

316
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:07,004
I've done nothing wrong. I don't owe you an excuse.

317
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:14,016
I find that hard to believe after you've been caught red handed after what had just happened.

318
00:42:14,016 --> 00:42:19,004
Is it not wrong to seduce someone who is engaged?

319
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:22,092
Well, isn't it?

320
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:25,072
I really have nothing to do with that.

321
00:42:25,072 --> 00:42:30,048
It was all Goo JoonPyo's idea.

322
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:41,098
Right, that's the typical excuse from girls like you, "I didn't do anything, he is the one who did it."

323
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:46,000
That's why I am here for a favor.

324
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,054
Even if my JoonPyo comes to see you, please don't see him.

325
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:54,076
Like you said, my JunPyo and you, JanDi,

326
00:42:54,076 --> 00:43:00,008
are now two people who have nothing to do with each other.

327
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:01,076
Can I believe that?

328
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:08,064
Please make me believe that JanDi has pride.

329
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:11,028
This is why,

330
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:15,096
I will not allow you guys to hang out with JoonPyo.

331
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:23,044
Please think of my family and come to your senses!

332
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:24,076
Lets go, Secretary Jung.

333
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:31,689
Yes, Madam.

334
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,044
Geum JanDi,

335
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,006
don't take JoonPyo's mother's words to heart.

336
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:38,068
She's normally like that.

337
00:43:38,068 --> 00:43:40,076
She's like that to us, too.

338
00:43:40,076 --> 00:44:15,008
But what is this talk about JoonPyo?

339
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:22,088
Ah . . .

340
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:25,052
What is all this?

341
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:29,072
Geum JanDi, it's our gift for your new house.

342
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:33,000
Eh?

343
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,088
Ready!

344
00:44:35,088 --> 00:46:49,092
Go!

345
00:46:49,092 --> 00:46:53,687
The President said that you are grounded for a while.

346
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:55,036
I suggest that you should watch out for a while.

347
00:46:55,036 --> 00:46:57,016
How the hell did that witch find out?

348
00:46:57,016 --> 00:47:00,035
I wasn't cautious enough.

349
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:06,044
I'm sorry.

350
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:08,064
Miss JaeKyung is here.

351
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:10,008
Why is that monster here again?

352
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:11,028
Why did I come?

353
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:14,018
What's so strange about a fiancee going to her fiance's house?

354
00:47:14,018 --> 00:47:15,096
I am not in the mood to amuse you.

355
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:18,269
Just go.

356
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:24,669
Really? I wanted to ask you along to JanDi's house. I guess you can't then.

357
00:47:24,669 --> 00:47:26,004
Then I will go alone.

358
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:28,008
Where did you say you were going?

359
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:36,048
JanDi's house. We had ramen at her place yesterday. I want to give this to her.

360
00:47:36,048 --> 00:47:40,004
I can go if you beg, but . . . Really?

361
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:44,026
But if the witch asks about it, say it's you.

362
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,068
Don't worry about that.

363
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:50,068
I already told her we're going on a date.

364
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,776
Let's go!

365
00:47:52,776 --> 00:47:53,098
Ah, it's troublesome!

366
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:54,052
Let's go!

367
00:47:54,052 --> 00:48:06,056
Quick! Wear your clothes, quick!

368
00:48:06,056 --> 00:48:10,487
KangSan, do you want more sausage?

369
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:14,171
He's sleeping.

370
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:17,002
San, if you sleep like that you won't grow. Get up.

371
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:23,092
San.

372
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:26,008
Ah! I feel good.

373
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:30,002
This kind of mood . . . It's been a long time . . .

374
00:48:30,002 --> 00:48:34,494
Isn't it like we are camping?

375
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:38,002
Since we're bored . . .

376
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:41,978
Wait, you're not asking about a kiss, right?

377
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:45,126
You can do that in front of me, don't worry.

378
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:46,928
Shall we play a game?

379
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:48,469
Game?

380
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:52,806
It's something that you have to do on a MT (bonding trip with coworkers or school friends).

381
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:53,088
What's that?

382
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:55,052
Truth or dare.

383
00:48:55,052 --> 00:48:56,092
Truth or dare?

384
00:48:56,092 --> 00:49:13,092
Me too! Me too! Me too!

385
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:19,028
You can ask a question to anyone you want.

386
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:21,004
How do you know whether it is true or false?

387
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:22,064
You can't lie.

388
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:24,008
But there is a "no comment" option.

389
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:26,028
"No comment" option?

390
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:32,074
Let's say, if you don't want to answer the question, you can, as punishment . . .

391
00:49:32,074 --> 00:49:34,706
Give a kiss!

392
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:37,000
JaeKyung, why would you say something like that?

393
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,565
Why not? It'll be fun!

394
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:43,098
Fine, then you have to do a french kiss.

395
00:49:43,098 --> 00:49:46,004
No way!

396
00:49:46,004 --> 00:49:49,048
Ok, then, a kiss on the forehead?

397
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:51,016
That should be fine, right?

398
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:57,036
If not . . . Getting hit?

399
00:49:57,036 --> 00:50:07,008
That's also great.

400
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:17,207
Just . . . kiss.

401
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:27,012
Me?

402
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:28,084
Yoon JiHoo.

403
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:47,028
Other than SeoHyun, is there anyone else you thought you could love?

404
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:51,036
For the first time in a long time, I have the desire to...

405
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:52,032
What?

406
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:55,092
Hey! That wasn't even a hard one!

407
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:57,078
Hey don't come over!

408
00:50:57,078 --> 00:51:17,064
Go away!

409
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:19,953
Is it my turn?

410
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:28,443
Yes.

411
00:51:28,443 --> 00:51:32,006
JoonPyo,

412
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:50,024
If the person you love is suffering because of you, would you let her go?

413
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,068
No.

414
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:59,424
I don't let go. I can't let go.

415
00:51:59,424 --> 00:52:02,068
I would hold on tightly to her . . .

416
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:10,265
and definitely make her happy.

417
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:13,766
Now it's me, right?

418
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:16,096
Geum JanDi.

419
00:52:16,096 --> 00:52:26,278
The promise we made last time, is it still valid?

420
00:52:26,278 --> 00:52:28,656
No matter what may happen,

421
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:32,182
you won't run away from me.

422
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:35,064
I promise.

423
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:37,008
I'll promise that,

424
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:48,004
whatever happens, your mother won't be the one to come between us.

425
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:53,088
No.

426
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:56,072
The person who made that promise,

427
00:52:56,072 --> 00:53:00,036
and the person who held the promise . . .

428
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:12,004
no longer exist.

429
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:20,036
Now it's my turn, right?

430
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:21,044
WooBin SunBae.

431
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:26,096
Me?

432
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:31,016
If the F4 were women,

433
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:34,012
who would you want to get married to?

434
00:53:34,012 --> 00:53:35,999
What?

435
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:37,004
I'm really curious.

436
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:38,004
Who would it be?

437
00:53:38,004 --> 00:53:41,052
No way. None of them. I'd never want to

438
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,092
Self-centered,

439
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:45,046
4th dimensional, (*meaning a person who is weird / in his own world) and a cold hearted womanizer.

440
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:47,004
Would you want me to spend my whole life with someone like that?

441
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:50,549
I'd rather be sent to a nunnery.

442
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:51,076
What's wrong?

443
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:52,096
Self-centered egoist?

444
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:54,008
4th-dimensional?

445
00:53:54,008 --> 00:53:56,092
Cold-hearted Casanova?

446
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:59,076
Hey! hey!

447
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:38,172
What would you do if you didn't have a choice but to choose one of us, huh?

448
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:41,022
That's all, right? I'm leaving.

449
00:54:41,022 --> 00:54:43,527
Hold on.

450
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,003
What now?

451
00:54:45,003 --> 00:54:46,086
I want to play it, too.

452
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:49,849
What?

453
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:54,042
That truth or dare game.

454
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:58,054
I am going to ask just one question. Will you answer me?

455
00:54:58,054 --> 00:55:01,891
That game ended a while ago.

456
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:05,066
Love and friendship.

457
00:55:05,066 --> 00:55:17,001
What would you choose if you had to choose one out of them?

458
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:19,968
Both.

459
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:25,022
There is no such thing as "giving up" in my dictionary.

460
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:39,022
Go in and sleep.

461
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:41,086
Fool.

462
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:46,007
If you keep saying all the right things,

463
00:55:46,007 --> 00:56:07,563
What am I supposed to do?

464
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:12,094
Noona, the ground's shaking.

465
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:18,003
I'm shaking too.

466
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:22,034
Is it an earthquake?

467
00:56:22,034 --> 00:56:28,054
Where do you think we are, Japan?

468
00:56:28,054 --> 00:56:58,002
EARTHQUAKE?!

469
00:56:58,002 --> 00:57:00,066
Oh, you guys are still here.Hurry, pack your belongings and leave.

470
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:03,034
This morning, we've started to demolish this building.

471
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:05,022
Demolish?

472
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:08,036
All of a sudden?

473
00:57:08,036 --> 00:57:10,086
We're just following orders. We don't have any of the details.

474
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,054
so please pack your belongings.

475
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,022
We must do as ordered.

476
00:57:15,022 --> 00:57:17,034
Who ordered?

477
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,003
We don't have that information.

478
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:28,078
Please hurry and pack your belongings.

479
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:33,086
You draw an engaged man to your house, and what?

480
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:38,078
You say you've done nothing wrong?

481
00:57:38,078 --> 00:57:44,086
Noona, what do we do now?

482
00:57:44,086 --> 00:58:13,054
It's ok. Don't worry.

483
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:18,044
It seems that father is mesmerized by this young lady, should I lend her to you?

484
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:44,098
YiJung sunbae.

485
00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:57,078
Well done. See you tomorrow.

486
00:58:57,078 --> 00:59:01,003
You're working real hard.

487
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:06,058
It's because I want to make something decent already.

488
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:11,003
Well then, I will leave first.

489
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:14,006
Goodbye.

490
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:15,074
What is that?

491
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:19,001
It's very unique.

492
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,003
I made it when I was little.

493
00:59:22,003 --> 00:59:24,078
It even has some writing.

494
00:59:24,078 --> 00:59:26,003
It's pretty.

495
00:59:26,003 --> 00:59:27,791
Do you like it?

496
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,359
Yes.

497
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,002
Teacher, can you lend this to me for a few days?

498
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:35,074
I've wanted to make something like this.

499
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:38,018
It's not hard. Would you like to try making one?

500
00:59:38,018 --> 00:59:42,681
It is something very valuable to me, so return it to me in one piece.

501
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:51,615
Yes.

502
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:52,947
It's pretty!

503
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:55,018
I'll see you tomorrow.- Okay.

504
00:59:55,018 --> 01:00:17,111
Take care.

505
01:00:17,111 --> 01:00:21,395
You've put too much pressure on your wrist.

506
01:00:21,395 --> 01:00:44,006
YiJung sunbae.

507
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,603
Noona, are you jealous?

508
01:00:46,603 --> 01:00:51,078
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to eat a whole bunch of seafood.

509
01:00:51,078 --> 01:00:53,007
So cheap.

510
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:57,082
You get to eat lots of delicious seafood all by yourself and get to sleep with mom and dad.

511
01:00:57,082 --> 01:00:59,009
Lucky.

512
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:02,616
Maybe I should I go too.

513
01:01:02,616 --> 01:01:03,086
No way!

514
01:01:03,086 --> 01:01:06,098
Didn't you say you were going to ShinHwa Medical School after you graduate from ShinHwa High School.

515
01:01:06,098 --> 01:01:10,026
How do you plan on doing that if you go?

516
01:01:10,026 --> 01:01:12,022
Do you really think you'll be okay?

517
01:01:12,022 --> 01:01:13,086
Don't worry.

518
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:19,034
I'll take good care of mom and dad.

519
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:33,078
I'm going.

520
01:01:33,078 --> 01:01:35,002
Noona,

521
01:01:35,002 --> 01:01:40,807
Don't just drink milk for breakfast. Eat some food too.

522
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:47,046
Food.

523
01:01:47,046 --> 01:01:53,042
It seems like Big brother Joonpyo still likes you.

524
01:01:53,042 --> 01:02:02,074
I said he still likes you.

525
01:02:02,074 --> 01:02:55,491
I'm always on your side sister. Be strong! Fighting!

526
01:02:55,491 --> 01:03:03,171
Geum Jandi.

527
01:03:03,171 --> 01:03:03,955
Geum JanDi.

528
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:08,074
Oh, I don't believe it.

529
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:17,042
I really have to get going.

530
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:33,022
What did he say?

531
01:03:33,022 --> 01:03:40,002
I wasn't going to eat it.

532
01:03:40,002 --> 99:59:59,999
Can't I eat a little?

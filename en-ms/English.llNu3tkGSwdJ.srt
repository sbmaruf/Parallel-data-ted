1
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,859
Liston: We are
so close to the end.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,210
The deadline for submissions
is approaching very fast.

3
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:11,609
Tonight at midnight,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,150
YouTube.com will no longer
be accepting entries.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,300
But after eight
amazing years,

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,469
it is finally time
to review everything

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,600
that has been uploaded
to our site

8
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,069
and begin the process
of selecting a winner.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,140
Kamangar:
We started YouTube in 2005

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,710
as a contest
with a simple goal:

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,490
to find the best video
in the world.

12
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,559
We had no idea we'd get
such a great response.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,720
You've uploaded over 70 hours
of footage every minute,

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,010
and we've been blown away
by the variety, imagination,

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,180
and anything goes spirit
that has driven the competition.

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,980
Dodson: We are all
storytellers.

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,350
That's what pulled me
into this contest.

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,470
You know, like,
stories about

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,890
how to Photoshop,

20
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,600
and stories about
"The Hobbit" trailer HD.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,510
I encourage everybody to watch
as many videos as possible

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,380
before YouTube deletes
everything tonight.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,580
Liston: Every video that
has been uploaded to our site

24
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,040
will be reviewed by our staff
of 30,000 technicians.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,940
They'll narrow down
the submissions,

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,860
and then our esteemed panel
will select the best video.

27
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,900
Which will be announced when
the website goes back online

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,410
in 2023, featuring the winner
of YouTube and nothing else.

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,879
Our team of judges is made up
of distinguished film critics,

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,950
YouTube celebrities,

31
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,900
and some of our most
prolific commenters.

32
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:22,789
Judge: Yes,
it's a product un-boxing.

33
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,469
But I think it adds
to the product un-boxing genre,

34
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,759
and it subverts
our expectations as an audience.

35
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,259
Judge 2: I don't suck, you suck,
and so does this video.

36
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,559
Dodson: Look,
I'm pretty sure

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,680
that the first ten minutes
of "Citizen Kane" is great,

38
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,489
but what I love about
"Epic Skateboard Fail"

39
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,590
is that it's short,
it's funny,

40
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,490
and it's straight
to the point.

41
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,200
Andrea: But is it
the best video on YouTube?

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,390
Judge: We're going to have
the same conversation

43
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:51,049
about all 150,000 videos
that we watch.

44
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,539
It's an amazing process.

45
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,849
Kamangar: We always
said that this

46
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,470
shouldn't be
a popularity contest.

47
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,779
"Gangnam Style" has
the same chance of winning

48
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:00,749
as a video with 40 views of
a man feeding bread to a duck.

49
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,079
KassemG: Of course
I'm hoping to win,

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,319
but even if I've inspired
just one person

51
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,579
and harass people
on the beach...

52
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,689
that's something I'll still
feel pretty good about.

53
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,000
Matt Harding: I better win.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,750
Otherwise all those years
traveling the world

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,990
were just an expensive
waste of time.

56
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,910
iJustine: My strategy from day one has always
been to upload as many videos as possible.

57
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,420
I mean, it's all about shots on goal.

58
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,410
Rafi Fine: It's important to keep
pushing yourself.

59
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,470
We challenge ourselves every day to think
of groups of people that can react to something

60
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,280
that most people already know about. It's
important that the judges appreciate the risks

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,300
that we take as artists.

62
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,870
Harry: When we heard
about the contest,

63
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,110
we spent months trying
to come up with the best idea.

64
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,830
Then Charlie bit my finger.

65
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,700
And I was like,
"Write that down!"

66
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,240
Judson: I did dancing.

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,690
David: My dad
put a lot of money

68
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,910
into this dental surgery
I didn't even need

69
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,330
just so we could
win this contest.

70
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,810
He'll be really,
really upset if we lose.

71
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,630
Liston: It's not just
about the recognition

72
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,530
of being
the world's best video.

73
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,610
As promised, when YouTube
started back in 2005,

74
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,370
the winner will also walk away
with an MP3 player

75
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,290
that clips to your sleeve

76
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,590
and a $500 stipend
for your next creative endeavor.

77
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,140
So, remember, get all of your
last-minute submissions

78
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,570
in by tonight at midnight.

79
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,960
While your work's finished,

80
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,000
ours is just beginning.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,650
It's gonna be
an exciting decade.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510


2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,120
How many cups are in
3 and 1/2 gallons?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,870
So before even addressing this
question, let's just think

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,640
about how large a cup is.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,990
Actually, I'll give you a little
bit of overview of how

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,800
many cups there are in a pint,
how many pints in a quart, and

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,870
how many quarts in a gallon.

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,610
Let me just draw a cube here,
and let's imagine

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,860
that this is a gallon.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,290


11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,000
The most common time we see
a gallon is when you see a

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,460
gallon of milk.

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,340
So let's say that that whole
thing is a gallon.

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,740
You can imagine if it had a
handle, it would be kind of a

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,130
big gallon of milk.

16
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,290
Now, there are 4 quarts
per gallon.

17
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,160
Let me write this over here.

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,730
There are 4 quarts per gallon.

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,690
So if I were to draw the quarts
here, I could divide

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,600
this gallon into 4 quarts, and
then each of these sections

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,660
would be a quart.

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,860
So you would have 4 quarts.

23
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,350
So this right here that I've
just drawn in blue would be

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,820
exactly 1 quart.

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,880
And obviously, there's 4 of them
in this entire gallon.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,330
Now, you can divide the
quarts into pints.

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,670
You have 2 pints per quart.

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,120
So this quart that I drew here,
I can divide it into 2,

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,380
like that, and this little
section that I'm highlighting

30
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,550
in magenta is a pint.

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,910
That is a pint right
over there.

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,996
And then finally, there
are 2 cups per pint.

33
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:42,070


34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,190
So this pint right here, I can
divide it into 2, and each of

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,370
these will be a cup.

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,310
So this section right
here will be a cup.

37
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,640
Now, we can go straight and
figure out exactly how many

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,820
cups there are per gallon.

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,300
Actually, that might be
an interesting way

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,710
to think about it.

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,940
If you have 4 quarts-- let's
multiply it right here.

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:12,080
So you have 4 quarts per gallon

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,705
times 2 pints per quart.

44
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:20,830


45
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,750
What does this give you?

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,160
This gives you 4 times
2 is equal to 8.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
And then the quarts cancel
out, and you

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,730
have 8 pints per gallon.

49
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,510


50
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,020
And that makes complete sense
because we had 4 quarts in

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,120
this gallon, and then
each of those quarts

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,700
have 2 pints in them.

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,120
So 4 times 2.

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,510
So 8 pints per gallon.

55
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,790
And then we can multiply that
times 2 cups per pint.

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,780
So I could just copy and
paste this right here.

57
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,650


58
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,040
Actually, I should've
cut and paste.

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,110
Let me select it again.

60
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,190
I want to do that so I get
that real estate back.

61
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,420
So edit, cut, edit, paste.

62
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,250
There you go.

63
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,660
So now you multiply this
times 2 cups per pint.

64
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,710
And the reason why this will
work is because you have pints

65
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,315
in the numerator.

66
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,480
It cancels out with the pints
in the denominator.

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,480
And you will be left with-- I'll
go back to the yellow-- 8

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,120
times 2 is 16.

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,790
In the numerator, we have
cups per gallon.

70
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,410
Now, we just figured how many
cups there are per gallon.

71
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,050
That makes sense.

72
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,780
This section right here is
exactly 1/16 of this entire

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,210
cube, this entire gallon.

74
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,570
But we haven't even answered
our question.

75
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,990
We want to figure out how
many cups there are

76
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,160
in 3 and 1/2 gallons.

77
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
So let's write it over here.

78
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,840
So we're concerned with
3 and 1/2 gallons.

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,900
I don't like working
with mixed numbers.

80
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,150
I like to turn them into
improper fractions.

81
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,200
3 and 1/2 is the same thing as
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

82
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,440
This is the same thing as 7/2.

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,000
If you divided 7 by 2, you would
get 3 with a remainder

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,010
of 1, or this would be
3 and 1/2, so this is

85
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,740
the exact same thing.

86
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,140
So we want to know how many
cups are in 7/2 gallons.

87
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,060
So what we want to do is end up
with cups, and we want the

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,640
gallons to cancel out.

89
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,450
So we have gallons in the
numerator right here.

90
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,100
It's definitely not in
the denominator.

91
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,180
And so we want to divide
by gallons.

92
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,940
And then we're going to
have a numerator.

93
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,700
We have cups in the numerator.

94
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,490
And how many cups are
there per gallon?

95
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,530
Well, we just figured
that out.

96
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,310
There are 16 cups per gallon.

97
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,080
When you multiply these two
quantities, the gallons will

98
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,250
cancel out, and you'll just be
left with cups, and that's

99
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,220
what we wanted.

100
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,940
So it's going to be
7/2 times 16.

101
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:51,040
So this is going to be
7 times 16/2 cups.

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,900
You could divide 16
by 2 to get 8.

103
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,140
2 divided by 2 is 1.

104
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,580
So it just becomes 7 times 8
divided by 1, or just 7 times

105
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,120
8, which is 56.

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,200
So this is equal to 56 cups.

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,700
And this should make sense.

108
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,360
This should be a much larger
number because cups are a much

109
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,710
smaller unit.

110
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,820
So if you have 3 and 1/2
gallons, you will have many,

111
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,400
many, many more cups in that
3 and 1/2 gallons,

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,660
so this makes sense.

113
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:16,867

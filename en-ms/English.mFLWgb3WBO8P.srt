1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,800
Round 9.564, or nine and
five hundred sixty-four

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,310
thousandths, to the
nearest tenth.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,645
So let me write it a little
bit larger, 9.564.

5
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,340
And we need to round to
the nearest tenth.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,760
So what's the tenth place?

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,730
The tenths plays
is right here.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,170
This right here represents
5 tenths.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,820
This is the ones place, this is
the tenths place, this is

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,430
the hundredths place,
and this is the

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,920
thousandths place right here.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,260
So we need to round to
the nearest tenth.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,790
So if we round up,
this will be 9.6.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,460
If we round down, this
will be 9.5.

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,620
And just like regular rounding,
when we're not

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,920
dealing with decimals, you move
to one spot, or you look

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,480
at one place to the right or one
place lower, I guess, and

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,950
you say is that 5 or larger?

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,500
If it is, you round up, if
it isn't, you round down.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,040
6 is definitely 5 or larger,
so we want to round up.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,790

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:19,800
So this 9.564 becomes 9.6,
or we can call this

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,510
nine and six tenths.

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,200
And then we're done!

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,799

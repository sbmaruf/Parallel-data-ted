Home isn't the same without you

3
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:11,094
Hey Dad, at the apartment now. Can you talk?

00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,333
Sure I'm ready

00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,019

00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,084
Honey are you there?

10
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,912
We miss you.

00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:32,011
Tomorrow we're gonna go shopping and try to find some...

00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,149
Who is that?

00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,031
His name is David

14
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,275
I don't like him

15
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:37,991
Maybe we should meet him first

16
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,315

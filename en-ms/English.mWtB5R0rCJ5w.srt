Welcome to the Google+ project. The first thing you want to do is create circles. They're

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,860
what Google+ revolves around. Check it out.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,139
Go to circles, and you'll see we've already created a few for you. Up at the top, you'll

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:16,139
see people you know. You can also add and invite friends from your email.

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,570
Now all you have to do is decide what circles they belong in. And don't orry, no one can

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,920
see what circle you have them in.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
Now make some of your own. Take your college buddies for instance. Make a circle for them.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,570
Someone might be in your "college" circle and your "friends" circle -- that's cool too.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,219
Circles make it super easy to control who you share stuff with -- be it photos, videos,

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,460
or where you're at. You simply add the circles you want to share it with.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,719
Here's where it gets really awesome. In your stream, you can either see what everyone you

12
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,510
know is saying, or you can keep it to just the circles you want to hear from. Now you

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,839
only need to know what you're cousin's eating for breakfast if you want to.

14
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:59,059
We all know mom doesn't need to see the photos from the weekend. And the boss doesn't need

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,489
to know you're at the beach on Tuesday.

16
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:07,430
Once you've created circles, there's a whole bunch of fun stuff that you can do. So how

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,090
about making some circles now?

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,569
Enjoy the Google+ project.

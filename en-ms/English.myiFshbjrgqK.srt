1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950


2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,640
I am back.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,510
Where were we?

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,750
We were saying that we know that
velocity, or kind of a

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,440
change in velocity, is
acceleration times time.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,660
I just wrote that a little bit
more formally, really kind of

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,990
incorporating the change
in velocity.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,580
Right?

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,460
The final velocity is equal to
the initial velocity plus

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,535
acceleration times time.

11
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:22,180
I actually could have written
it like this: I could have

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,640
written vf minus vi is equal
to acceleration times time,

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,010
and this is the change
in velocity.

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,190
Actually, that's the way
I should be doing it.

15
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,280
As you can tell, I kind of do
some of this stuff on the fly,

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,070
but I do that for a reason--
it's because I want you to get

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,460
the same intuition that I
hopefully have, instead of

18
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,480
just kind of doing it in a very
formal way in a book, and

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,400
sometimes the book doesn't
necessarily make the

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,110
connections in the
most natural way.

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,130
This is going straight from my
brain to this video, and

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,410
hopefully into your brain.

23
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,560
These are all ways of saying the
same thing, and I actually

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,960
should write this as change in
velocity-- that triangle, or

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,910
delta, just means change.

26
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,220
The final velocity, my initial
velocity, is equal to

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,590
acceleration times time.

28
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,200
The average velocity, you could
just figure-- you take

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,830
the final, and you take the
initial, and you average the

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,220
two, and it's equal to this.

31
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,280
Then I said, we know what the
final velocity is-- this is

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,920
the final velocity, and the
average velocity is this.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,470
We substitute it for the final
velocity, and then we came to

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,860
this equation for average
velocity.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,650
Then before I almost ran out of
time, I said I'm going to

36
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,720
take this formula for the
average velocity-- and I

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,820
really encourage you to just
play around with these

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,100
formulas yourself and derive
it yourself, because it's

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,930
going to pay huge rewards later
on when you forget the

40
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,650
formulas on your exam, but you
can work it out anyway.

41
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,430
We have this formula for average
velocity, and let's

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,600
substitute it back into this, so
we can say that distance is

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:07,290
equal to the average velocity,
and that's this: vi plus at

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,680
over 2 times time.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,160
If we just distributed that t,
we have the initial velocity

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:26,440
times time, plus acceleration
times time squared over 2.

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,670
So, distance is equal to the
initial velocity-- let me draw

48
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,200
a line here, so we don't confuse
things-- distance is

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,400
equal to the initial velocity
times time plus acceleration

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,510
times time squared
divided by 2.

51
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,250
Sometimes the physics teacher
might just teach at squared

52
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,100
2-- that's sometimes what people
memorize, and that's

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,490
because in a lot of these
projectile motion problems,

54
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,460
your initial velocity is 0,
especially when you're

55
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,440
dropping a rock.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,610
If your initial velocity is 0,
this term would cancel out.

57
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,640
If you do that last problem that
we just did using this

58
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,680
example, you'll get
the same answer.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,230
I said we're accelerating with
gravity, so a is equal to 10

60
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,490
meters per second squared,
then time is equal to 2

61
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,600
seconds, and then initial
velocity is equal to 0, and

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,110
let me make some space here.

63
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,360


64
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,420
The initial velocity is 0-- so
this term just cancels out--

65
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,570
plus acceleration, 10
meters per second

66
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,170
squared times time squared.

67
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:46,830


68
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,620
You have 10 meters per second
squared times time squared,

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,750
time is two seconds,
so it's 4.

70
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,210
Since we've squared the number,
we should also square

71
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,780
the units, so it's 4 seconds
squared, and all of

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,180
that is over 2.

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,620
Like we learned before-- 10
times 4 divided 2 is 20, and

74
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,800
we have seconds squared the
denominator and we have

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,430
seconds squared in the
numerator here.

76
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,353
They cancel out, and we're
just left with meters.

77
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,329


78
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,690
Actually, I'm going to leave it
there for now, and in the

79
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,630
next presentation, I'll
explore some of these

80
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,150
mechanics even further.

81
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,840
I'll see you soon.

82
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:30,900

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,760
We're asked to solve the
log of x plus log of 3

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,840
is equal to 2 log
of 4 minus log of 2.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,530
So let me just rewrite it.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,080
So we have the log of x plus
the log of 3 is equal to 2 times

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,150
the log of 4 minus the log
of 2, or the logarithm of 2.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,110
And this is a reminder.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,010
Whenever you see a logarithm
written without a base,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,560
the implicit base is 10.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,640
So we could write 10 here, 10
here, 10 here, and 10 here.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,130
But for the rest
of this example,

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,620
I'll just skip writing
the 10 just because it'll

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,730
save a little bit of time.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,320
But remember, this
literally means log base 10.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,820
So this expression,
right over here,

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,580
is the power I have
to raise 10 to to get

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,595
x, the power I have to
raise 10 to to get 3.

18
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,220
Now with that out of
the way, let's see

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,830
what logarithm
properties we can use.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,850
So we know, if we-- and
these are all the same base--

21
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:00,790
we know that if we have log base
a of b plus log base a of c,

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,110
then this is the same
thing as log base a of bc.

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,574
And we also know-- so let
me write all the logarithm

24
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:09,990
properties that
we know over here.

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,834
We also know that if
we have a logarithm--

26
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,750
let me write it this
way, actually-- if I have

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,580
b times the log
base a of c, this

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,847
is equal to log base a
of c to the bth power.

29
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:28,680
And we also know, and
this is derived really

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,490
straight from both of
these, is that if I

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,170
have log base a of b
minus log base a of c,

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,450
that this is equal to the
log base a of b over c.

33
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,040
And this is really
straight derived

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,850
from these two right over here.

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,550
Now with that out of the way,
let's see what we can apply.

36
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,590
So right over here, we have
all the logs are the same base.

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,570
And we have logarithm of
x plus logarithm of 3.

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,200
So by this property
right over here,

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,810
the sum of logarithms
with the same base,

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,840
this is going to be equal
to log base 3-- sorry,

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,200
log base 10-- so I'll
just write it here.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,759
log base 10 of 3 times x, of 3x.

43
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,320
Then, based on this
property right over here,

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,700
this thing could be
rewritten-- so this

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,200
is going to be equal to--
this thing can be written

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:29,040
as log base 10 of 4 to the
second power, which is really

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,940
just 16.

48
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,680
So this is just going to be 16.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,680
And then we still have minus
logarithm base 10 of 2.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,300
And now, using
this last property,

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,260
we know we have one logarithm
minus another logarithm.

52
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,310
This is going to be equal
to log base 10 of 16

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,880
over 2, 16 divided by 2,
which is the same thing as 8.

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,060
So the right-hand side
simplifies to log base 10 of 8.

55
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,570
The left-hand side
is log base 10 of 3x.

56
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,430
So if 10 to some power is
going to be equal to 3x.

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,210
And 10 to the same power
is going to be equal to 8.

58
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,193
So 3x must be equal to 8.

59
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,760

60
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,900
3x is equal to 8, and then we
can divide both sides by 3.

61
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,770
Divide both sides by 3, you
get x is equal to 8 over 3.

62
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,190
One way, this little step here,
I said, look, 10 to the-- this

63
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,180
is an exponent.

64
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,720
If I raise 10 to this exponent,
I get 3x, 10 to this exponent,

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,600
I get 8.

66
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,102
So 8 and 3x must
be the same thing.

67
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:43,060
One other way you could
have thought about this

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,170
is, let's take 10 to this
power, on both sides.

69
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,570
So you could say 10 to
this power, and then 10

70
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,430
to this power over here.

71
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,920
If I raise 10 to
the power that I

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
need to raise 10
to to get to 3x,

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,020
well, I'm just going to get 3x.

74
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,070
If I raise 10 to the power that
I need to raise 10 to to get 8,

75
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm just going to get 8.

76
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,500
So once again, you've
got the 3x is equal to 8,

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,970
and then you can simplify.

78
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,020
You get x is equal to 8/3.

79
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,562

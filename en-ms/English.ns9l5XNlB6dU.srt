1
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:04,771
so now we have a very very very interesting problem

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,631
on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses

3
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:15,668
one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X

4
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:23,625
But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn't necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X.

5
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:33,657
We have two of these X's and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here.

6
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:41,041
Each of these is 1kg block and balances them out. So the first question I'm going to ask you is, can you express this Mathematically?

7
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:45,827
Can you express what we're seeing here, the fact that this total mass balances out with this total mass.

8
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:49,236
Can you express that mathematically?

9
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:54,477
Well let's just think about our total mass on this side.

10
00:00:54,815 --> 00:01:00,865
We have two masses of mass X so those two are gonna total at 2X, and then you have a mass of Y.

11
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:07,972
So then you're gonna have another Y. So the total mass on the left hand side. Alright let me re-write a little bit closer to the center.

12
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:13,985
So,it doesn't get too spread out. On the left hand side, I got 2X plus a mass of Y. That's the total mass.

13
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:24,788
The total mass on the left hand side is 2X plus Y, the total mass on the right hand side is just 8. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is equal to 8

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:30,748
And since we see that the scale is balance, this total mass must be equal to this total mass.

15
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,420
So, we can write an equal sign there.

16
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:45,621
Now my question to you is there anything we can do just based on the information that we have here to solve for either the mass X or for the mass Y.

17
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,315
Is there anything that we can do.

18
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:54,584
Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there's actually very little.

19
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,250
You might say that "Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides" You might take this Y block up.

20
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:03,495
But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don't know what Y is.

21
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:09,761
And if you think about it algebraically you might get rid of the Y here. Subtracting Y and you're gonna subtract Y from this side too.

22
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:11,926
So, you're not gonna get rid of the Y.

23
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:18,091
Same thing with the X's, you actually don't have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is.

24
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:25,919
Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around. And what we do is we take one of these X blocks.

25
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:32,578
And I stack it over here,and I also take one of the Y block and I stack it right over there.

26
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:37,369
And then I keep adding all these ones until I balance these things out.

27
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:42,666
So, I keep adding these ones. Obviously if I just place this, this will go down cause there's nothing on that side.

28
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:56,748
But I keep adding these blocks until it all balances out and I find that my scale balances once I have 5 kg on the right hand side

29
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:03,635
So, once again let me ask you this information having X and Y on the left hand side and a 5kg on the right hand side

30
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:07,853
And the fact that they are balance, how can we represent that mathematically?

31
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:21,596
Well our total mass on the left hand side is X plus Y. And our total mass, let me right that once again a little bit closer to the center.

32
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:31,278
It's X plus Y on the left hand side and the right hand side I have 5 kg. I have 5kg.

33
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:39,975
I have 5 kg on the right hand side. And we know that's actually balance the scale. So these total masses must be equal to each other.

34
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:46,084
And this information by itself, once again. There's nothing I can do with it. I don't know what X and Y.

35
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:51,752
If Y is 4 maybe X is 1 or maybe X is 4, Y is 1. Who knows what these are.

36
00:03:51,919 --> 00:04:00,999
The interesting thing is we can actually use both of these information to figure out what X and Y actually is.

37
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:06,288
And I'm giving you a few seconds to think about how we can approach this situation.

38
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,220
Well think about it this way, we know that X plus Y is equal to 5.

39
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:18,192
So if we were to get rid of an X and a Y on this side,on the left hand side of the equation.

40
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:24,482
What would we have to get rid of on the right hand side of the, or if we know if we get rid of X and Y on the left hand side of the scale

41
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,580
What would we get rid of the right hand side of the scale to take away the same mass?

42
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:38,547
Well if we take away the X and Y on the left hand side, we know that an X plus Y is 5kg. So, we'll just have to take 5kg from the right hand side.

43
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:45,438
So, lets think about what that would do. Well then I'll just have an X over here, I'll just have some of these masses left over here.Then I would what X is.

44
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:48,833
Now lets think about how we can represent that algebraically

45
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,909
Essentially for taking an X and Y from the left hand side. If I'm taking an X and Y from the left hand side.

46
00:04:55,138 --> 00:05:09,758
I'm subtracting an X, and I'm subtracting an X. Actually let me think of it this way. I'm subtracting an X plus Y. I'm subtracting an X and Y on the left hand side.

47
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,276
But then what am I gonna do on the right hand side?

48
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,689
Well an X and a Y we know has a mass of 5. So we can subtract 5 from the right hand side.

49
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:22,425
And the only way I'm gonna be able to do this is because of the information that we got from the second scale.

50
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:29,825
So I can take away 5. So this is going to be equal to taking away 5. Taking away X and a Y is equal to taking away 5.

51
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:37,389
And we know that because an X and a Y is equal to 5kg. And if we take away an X and a Y on the left hand side, what do we left with?

52
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,529
Well this is gonna be the same thing. Let me rewrite this part.

53
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:54,972
This, taking away an X and a Y is the same thing if you distribute the negative sign as taking away an X and taking away a Y.

54
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:05,738
And so on the left hand side, we're left with just 2X and we have taken away one of the X's, we're left just an X.

55
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,601
And we had a Y and we've took away one of the Y. So we're left with no Y.

56
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,230
We see that visually, we're left with just an X here.

57
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,137
And what do we have on the right hand side?

58
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:26,104
We had 8 and we know X and Y is equal to 5, so we took away 5. So to keep the scale balance. And so 8 minus 5 is going to be 3.

59
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:38,953
8 minus 5 is equal to 3 and just like that using this extra information we're able to figure out that the mass of X is equal to 3.

60
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:47,002
Now, one final question. We're able to figure out the mass of X, can you figure out what the mass of Y is.

61
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:53,448
Well we can go back to either one of these scales. Probably be simpler to go back to this one.

62
00:06:53,766 --> 00:07:01,156
We know that the mass of X plus the mass of Y is equal to 5. So we could say, one thing we know that X is now is equal to 3.

63
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:13,710
We know that this is now a 3kg mass. We can rewrite this is 3 plus Y is equal to 5

64
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:17,553
Well now we say, we could take 3 away from both sides.

65
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:24,104
if I take 3 away from the left hand side I just have to take 3 away from the right hand side to keep my scale balanced.

66
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:30,283
And I'll be left with the mass of Y is balance with a mass of 2 or Y is equal to 2.

67
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:43,487
That's an analogy of taking 3 from both sides of this equation. And on the left hand side, I'm just left with a Y and on the right hand side I'm just left with a 2.

68
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:52,203
So, X is equal to 3kg and Y is equal to 2kg and what I encouraged you to do is verify that it made sense right up here.

69
00:07:52,369 --> 00:08:00,169
Figure out what the total mass on the left hand and the right hand or verify what the total mass right over here really was 8 to begin with.

70
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:08,622
And you'll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg.

71
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:12,617
And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5.

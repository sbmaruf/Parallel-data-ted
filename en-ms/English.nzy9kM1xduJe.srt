00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,360
Welcome to the presentation
on ordering numbers.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,940
Let's get started with some
problems that I think, as you

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,270
go through the examples
hopefully, you'll understand

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,910
how to do these problems.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,700
So let's see.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:23,200
The first set of numbers that
we have to order is 35.7%,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:44,590
108.1% 0.5, 13/93,
and 1 and 7/68.

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,590
So let's do this problem.

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,810
The important thing to remember
whenever you're doing this type

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,820
of ordering of numbers is to
realize that these are all just

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,940
different ways to represent--
these are all a percent or a

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,270
decimal or a fraction or a
mixed-- are all just different

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,680
ways of representing numbers.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,110
It's very hard to compare when
you just look at it like this,

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,130
so what I like to do is I
like to convert them

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,190
all to decimals.

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,100
But there could be someone who
likes to convert them all to

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,220
percentages or convert them all
to fractions and then compare.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,920
But I always find decimals to
be the easiest way to compare.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,370
So let's start with this 35.7%.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,940
Let's turn this into a decimal.

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,090
Well, the easiest thing to
remember is if you have a

24
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,490
percent you just get rid of
the percent sign and

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,580
put it over 100.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:38,970
So 35.7% is the same
thing as 35.7/100.

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,020
Like 5%, that's the same thing
as 5/100 or 50% is just

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,050
the same thing as 50/100.

29
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:53,990
So 35.7/100, well, that
just equals 0.357.

30
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,730
If this got you a little
confused another way to think

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,970
about percentage points is if I
write 35.7%, all you have to do

32
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,540
is get rid of the percent sign
and move the decimal to the

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,140
left two spaces and
it becomes 0.357.

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,870
Let me give you a couple of
more examples down here.

35
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,050
Let's say I had 5%.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,020
That is the same
thing as 5/100.

37
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,670
Or if you do the decimal
technique, 5%, you could just

38
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,730
move the decimal and you
get rid of the percent.

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,630
And you move the decimal over 1
and 2, and you put a 0 here.

40
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,370
It's 0.05.

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,280
And that's the same
thing as 0.05.

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,380
You also know that 0.05 and
5/100 are the same thing.

43
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,620
So let's get back
to the problem.

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,772
I hope that distraction didn't
distract you too much.

45
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,190
Let me scratch out all this.

46
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,050
So 35.7% is equal to 0.357.

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,870
Similarly, 108.1%.

48
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,080
Let's to the technique where we
just get rid of the percent and

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,350
move the decimal space over
1, 2 spaces to the left.

50
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:08,600
So then that equals 1.081.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,570
See we already know that
this is smaller than this.

52
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,140
Well the next one is easy,
it's already in decimal form.

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,040
0.5 is just going to
be equal to 0.5.

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,820

55
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,050
Now 13/93.

56
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,340
To convert a fraction into
a decimal we just take the

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,320
denominator and divide
it into the numerator.

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,350
So let's do that.

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,020
93 goes into 13?

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,530

61
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,760
Well, we know it goes
into 13 zero times.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,990
So let's add a
decimal point here.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,550
So how many times
does 93 go into 130?

64
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,530
Well, it goes into it one time.

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,410
1 times 93 is 93.

66
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,061

67
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,550
Becomes a 10.

68
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,960
That becomes a 2.

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,700
Then we're going to
borrow, so get 37.

70
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,590
Bring down a 0.

71
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,010
So 93 goes into 370?

72
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,470
Let's see.

73
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,790
4 times 93 would be 372,
so it actually goes into

74
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,695
it only three times.

75
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:19,390

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,880
3 times 3 is 9.

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,270
3 times 9 is 27.

78
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,110

79
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,605
So this equals?

80
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:38,050
Let's see, this equals-- if we
say that this 0 becomes a 10.

81
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,620
This become a 16.

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,440
This becomes a 2.

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,210
81.

84
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,120
And then we say, how many
times does 93 go into 810?

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,860
It goes roughly 8 times.

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
And we could actually keep
going, but for the sake of

87
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,640
comparing these numbers, we've
already gotten to a pretty

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,580
good level of accuracy.

89
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,740
So let's just stop this problem
here because the decimal

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,720
numbers could keep going on,
but for the sake of comparison

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,410
I think we've already got a
good sense of what this

92
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,360
decimal looks like.

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,330
It's 0.138 and then
it'll just keep going.

94
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,010
So let's write that down.

95
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,340
And then finally, we have
this mixed number here.

96
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,070
And let me erase some of
my work because I don't

97
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,840
want to confuse you.

98
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,700
Actually, let me keep it
the way it is right now.

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,120
The easiest way to convert a
mixed number into a decimal is

100
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,630
to just say, OK, this is 1
and then some fraction

101
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,920
that's less than 1.

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,420
Or we could convert it to a
fraction, an improper fraction

103
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,790
like-- oh, actually there are
no improper fractions here.

104
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,640
Actually, let's do it that way.

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,630
Let's convert to an improper
fraction and then convert

106
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,110
that into a decimal.

107
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,060
Actually, I think I'm going to
need more space, so let me

108
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,740
clean up this a little bit.

109
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:58,240

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,595
There.

111
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:01,040
We have a little more
space to work with now.

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,260

113
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,570
So 1 and 7/68.

114
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,700
So to go from a mixed number to
an improper fraction, what you

115
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,760
do is you take the 68 times 1
and add it to the

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,720
numerator here.

117
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
And why does this make sense?

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,120
Because this is the same
thing as 1 plus 7/68.

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,680
1 and 7/68 is the same
thing as 1 plus 7/68.

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
And that's the same thing as
you know from the fractions

121
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,330
module, as 68/68 plus 7/68.

122
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:47,650
And that's the same thing
as 68 plus 7-- 75/68.

123
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,790
So 1 and 7/68 is
equal to 75/68.

124
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,870
And now we convert this to a
decimal using the technique

125
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,350
we did for 13/93.

126
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,570
So we say-- let me
get some space.

127
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:05,000
We say 68 goes into 75--
suspicion I'm going

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,360
to run out of space.

129
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,160
68 goes into 75 one time.

130
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,290
1 times 68 is 68.

131
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,460
75 minus 68 is 7.

132
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,350
Bring down the 0.

133
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,490
Actually, you don't have to
write the decimal there.

134
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,100
Ignore that decimal.

135
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,400
68 goes into 70 one time.

136
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,150
1 times 68 is 68.

137
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,990
70 minus 68 is 2,
bring down another 0.

138
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,240
68 goes into 20 zero times.

139
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,550
And the problem's going to keep
going on, but I think we've

140
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,990
already once again, gotten to
enough accuracy that

141
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,040
we can compare.

142
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:48,320
So 1 and 7/68 we've now figured
out is equal to 1.10-- and if

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,000
we kept dividing we'll keep
getting more decimals of

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,510
accuracy, but I think we're
now ready to compare.

145
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,550
So all of these numbers I just
rewrote them as decimals.

146
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,550
So 35.7% is 0.357.

147
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,000
108.1%-- ignore this for
now because we just used

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,720
that to do the work.

149
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,660
It's 108.1% is equal to 1.081.

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,260
0.5 is 0.5.

151
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,770
13/93 is 0.138.

152
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,850
And 1 and 7/68 is 1.10
and it'll keep going on.

153
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,010
So what's the smallest?

154
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,320
So the smallest is
0.-- actually, no.

155
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,300
The smallest is right here.

156
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,450
So I'm going to rank them
from smallest to largest.

157
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,250
So the smallest is 0.138.

158
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,640
Then the next largest
is going to be 0.357.

159
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,470
Then the next largest
is going to be 0.5.

160
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,460
Then you're going to have 1.08.

161
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,620
And then you're going
to have 1 and 7/68.

162
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,840
Well, actually, I'm going to do
more examples of this, but for

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,890
this video I think this is the
only one I have time for.

164
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,910
But hopefully this gives you a
sense of doing these problems.

165
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,370
I always find it easier
to go into the decimal

166
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,280
mode to compare.

167
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
And actually, the hints
on the module will

168
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,670
be the same for you.

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,040
But I think you're ready at
least now to try the problems.

170
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,170
If you're not, if you want to
see other examples, you might

171
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,830
just want to either re-watch
this video and/or I might

172
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,530
record some more videos with
more examples right now.

173
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,560
Anyway, have fun.

1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,267
I think you've probably heard the word divide before,

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,730
where someone tells you to divide something up.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,450
Divide the money between you and your brother

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,650
or between you and your buddy.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,640
And it essentially means to cut up something.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,458
So let me write down the word divide.

7
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:24,328
Let's say that I have four quarters.

8
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:27,500
Do my best to draw the quarters.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,320
If I have four quarters just like that.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,030
That's my rendition of George Washington on the quarters.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,620
And let's say there's two of us,

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,550
and we're going to divide the quarters between us.

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,520
So this is me right here.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,870
Let me try my best to draw me.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,760
So that's me right there.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,160
Let's see, I have a lot of hair.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,705
And then this is you right there.

18
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,300
I'll do my best.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,270
Let's say you're bald.

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,407
But you have side burns.

21
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:09,077
Maybe you have a little bit of a beard.

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,317
So that's you, that's me,

23
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:15,520
and we're going to divide these four quarters between the two of us.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,876
So notice, we have four quarters

25
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:23,580
and we're going to divide between the two of us.

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,540
There are two of us.

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,740
And I want to stress the number two.

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,880
So we're going to divide four quarters by two.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,480
We're going to divide it between the two of us.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,900
And you've probably done something like this.

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,540
What happens?

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,230
Well, each of us are going to get two quarters.

33
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,290
So let me divide it.

34
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,180
We're going to divide it into two.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,060
Essentially what I did do is I take the four quarters

36
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,954
and I divide it into two equal groups.

37
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,697
Two equal groups.

38
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,931
And that's what division is.

39
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,620
We cut up this group of quarters into two equal groups.

40
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,012
So when you divide four quarters into two groups,

41
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:08,061
so this was four quarters right there.

42
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,592
And you want to divide it into two groups.

43
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:11,770
This is group one.

44
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,530
Group one right here.

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,380
And this is group two right here.

46
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,890
How many numbers are in each group?

47
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,990
Or how many quarters are in each group?

48
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,870
Well, in each group I have one, two quarters.

49
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,660
I'll need to use a brighter color.

50
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,260
I have one, two quarters in each group.

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,040
One quarter and two quarters in each group.

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,153
So to write this out mathematically,

53
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:37,855
I think this is something that you've done,

54
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,728
probably as long as you've been splitting money

55
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,882
between you and your siblings and your buddies.

56
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,066
Actually, let me scroll over a little bit,

57
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:47,330
so you can see my entire picture.

58
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,360
How do we write this mathematically?

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,270
We can write that four divided by-- so this four.

60
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,980
Let me use the right colors.

61
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,758
So this four, which is this four, divided by the two groups,

62
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:07,500
these are the two groups: group one and this is group two right here.

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,030
So divided into two groups or into two collections.

64
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,953
Four divided by two is equal to--

65
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,850
when you divide four into two groups,

66
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,361
each group is going to have two quarters in it.

67
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,918
It's going to be equal to two.

68
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,388
And I just wanted to use this example

69
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:25,149
because I want to show you

70
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:29,260
that division is something that you've been using all along.

71
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,822
And another important, I guess, takeaway or thing to realize about this,

72
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:36,328
is on some level this is the opposite of multiplication.

73
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,564
If I said that I had two groups of two quarters,

74
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:48,694
I would multiply the two groups times the two quarters each

75
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:52,849
and I would say I would then have four quarters.

76
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,886
So on some level, these are saying the same thing.

77
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,538
But just to make it a little bit more concrete in our head,

78
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,400
let's do a couple of more examples.

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Let's do a bunch of more examples.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,681
So let's write down, what is six divided by--

81
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,900
I'm trying to keep it nice and color coded.

82
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,800
Six divided by three, what is that equal to?

83
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,150
Let's just draw six objects.

84
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,590
They can be anything.

85
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,030
Let's say I have six bell peppers.

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,050
I won't take too much trouble to draw them.

87
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,260
Well, that's not what a bell pepper looks like,

88
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,210
but you get the idea.

89
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,370
So one, two, three, four, five, six.

90
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,030
And I'm going to divide it by three.

91
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,700
And one way that we can think about that

92
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,059
is that means I want to divide my six bell peppers

93
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,730
into three equal groups of bell peppers.

94
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,384
You could kind of think of it as if three people are going to share these bell peppers,

95
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:48,970
how many do each of them get?

96
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,840
So let's divide it into three groups.

97
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,770
So that's our six bell peppers.

98
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,580
I'm going to divide it into three groups.

99
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,564
So the best way to divide it into three groups is

100
00:04:56,564 --> 00:05:02,470
I can have one group right there, two groups, or the second group right there,

101
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,910
and then, the third group.

102
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,350
And then each group will have exactly how many bell peppers?

103
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,120
They'll have one, two.

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,510
One, two.

105
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,140
One, two bell peppers.

106
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,060
So six divided by three is equal to two.

107
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,384
So the best way or one way to think about it

108
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:26,790
is that you divided the six into three groups.

109
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,880
Now you could view that a slightly different way,

110
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,392
although it's not completely different,

111
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:33,110
but it's a good way to think about it.

112
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,150
You could also think of it as six divided by three.

113
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,936
And once again, let's say I have raspberries now-- easier to draw.

114
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:47,460
One, two, three, four, five, six.

115
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,598
And here, instead of dividing it into three groups like we did here.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,290
This was one group, two group, three groups.

117
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,165
Instead of dividing into three groups,

118
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,521
what I want to do is say well,

119
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:02,710
if I'm dividing six divided by three, I want to divide it into groups of three.

120
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,260
Not into three groups.

121
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,960
I want to divide it into groups of three.

122
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,490
So how many groups of three am I going to have?

123
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,930
Well, let me draw some groups of three.

124
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,040
So that is one group of three.

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,725
And that is two groups of three.

126
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:26,674
So if I take six things and I divide them into groups of three,

127
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:29,950
I will end up with one, two groups.

128
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,230
So that's another way to think about division.

129
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,550
And this is an interesting thing.

130
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,908
When you think about these two relations,

131
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:42,120
you'll see a relationship between six divided by three and six divided by two.

132
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Let me do that right here.

133
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,483
What is six divided by two,

134
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,740
when you think of it in this context right here?

135
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,850
Six divided by two, when you do it like that--

136
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,780
let me draw one, two, three, four, five, six.

137
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,286
When we think about six divided by two in terms of dividing it into two groups,

138
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:06,725
what we can end up is we could have one group like this

139
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,674
and then one group like this,

140
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,500
and each group will have three elements.

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,541
It'll have three things in it.

142
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,730
So six divided by two is three.

143
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,400
Or you could think of it the other way.

144
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,683
You could say that six divided by two is--

145
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:26,420
you're taking six objects: one, two, three, four, five, six.

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,041
And your dividing it into groups of two

147
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,200
where each group has two elements.

148
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,920
And that on some level is an easier thing to do.

149
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,640
If each group has two elements, well, that's the one right there.

150
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,690
They don't even have to be nicely ordered.

151
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,900
This could be one group right there

152
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,990
and that could be the other group right there.

153
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,580
I don't have to draw them all stacked up.

154
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,920
These are just groups of two.

155
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,390
But how many groups do I have?

156
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,250
I have one, two, three.

157
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,070
I have three groups.

158
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,706
But notice something, it's no coincidence that six divided by three is two,

159
00:07:57,706 --> 00:08:00,690
and six divided by two is three.

160
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,280
Let me write that down.

161
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,721
We get six divided by three is equal to two,

162
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,290
and six divided by two is equal to three.

163
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,508
And the reason why you see this relation where you can kind of swap this two and this three

164
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:26,115
is because two times three is equal to six.

165
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,477
Let's say I have two groups of three.

166
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,840
Let me draw two groups of three.

167
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,292
So that's one group of three and then here's another group of three.

168
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,792
So two groups of three is equal to six.

169
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:44,360
Two times three is equal to six.

170
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,401
Or you could think of it the other way,

171
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,090
if I have three groups of two.

172
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,900
So that's one group of two right there.

173
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,840
I have another group of two right there.

174
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,450
And then I have a third group of two right there.

175
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,960
What is that equal to?

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,240
Three groups of two-- three times two.

177
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,260
That's also equal to six.

178
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,840
So two times three is equal to six.

179
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,968
Three times two is equal to six.

180
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,522
We saw this in the multiplication video

181
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:09,530
that the order doesn't matter.

182
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,182
But that's the reason why if you want to divide it,

183
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:13,368
if you want to go the other way--

184
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:18,990
if you have six things and you want to divide it into groups of two, you get three.

185
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,058
If you have six and you want to divide into groups of three, you get two.

186
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,360
Let's do a couple more problems.

187
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:33,963
I think it'll really make sense about what division is all about.

188
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,863
Let's do an interesting one.

189
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,600
Let's do nine divided by four.

190
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,360
So if we think about nine divided by four, let me draw nine objects.

191
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,170
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

192
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,108
Now when you divide by four, for this problem,

193
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:57,140
I'm thinking about dividing it into groups of four.

194
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,923
So if I want to divide it into groups of four--

195
00:09:58,923 --> 00:09:59,899
Let me try doing that.

196
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,521
So here is one group of four.

197
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,820
I just picked any of them right like that.

198
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,570
That's one group of four.

199
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,100
Then here's another group of four, right there.

200
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,330
And then I have this left over thing.

201
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,051
Maybe we could call it a remainder,

202
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:18,235
where I can't put this one into a group of four.

203
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,793
When I'm dividing by four,

204
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:24,090
I can only cut up the nine into groups of four.

205
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,102
So the answer here, and this is a new concept for you maybe,

206
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:32,395
nine divided by four is going to be two groups.

207
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:34,802
I have one group here, and another group here,

208
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,670
and then I have a remainder of one.

209
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,970
I have one left over that I wasn't able to do with.

210
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,870
Remainder-- that says remainder one.

211
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,348
Nine divided by four is two remainder one.

212
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,010
If I asked you what twelve divided by four is-- so let me do twelve.

213
00:10:53,010 --> 00:11:00,802
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

214
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:01,980
So let me write that down.

215
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,918
Twelve divided by four.

216
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:08,414
So I want to divide these twelve objects--

217
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,480
maybe they're apples or plums.

218
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,905
And divide them into groups of four.

219
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,845
So let me see if I can do that.

220
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:19,340
So this is one group of four just like that.

221
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,340
This is another group of four just like that.

222
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,188
And this is pretty straightforward.

223
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,666
And then I have a third group of four.

224
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,996
Just like that.

225
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:30,750
And there's nothing left over, like I had before.

226
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,210
I can exactly divide twelve objects into three groups of four.

227
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,190
One, two, three groups of four.

228
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,474
So twelve divided by four is equal to three.

229
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:47,110
And we can do the exercise that we saw on the previous video.

230
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,666
What is twelve divided by three?

231
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,840
Let me do a new color.

232
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,200
Twelve divided by three.

233
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,501
Now based on what we've learn so far,

234
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:00,884
we say, that should just be four, because three times four is twelve.

235
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:02,770
But let's prove it to ourselves.

236
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,420
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

237
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
Let's divide it into groups of three.

238
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,892
And I'm going to make them a little strange looking

239
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:17,730
just so you see that you don't always have to do it into nice, clean columns.

240
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,870
So that's a group of three, right there.

241
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,680
Twelve divided by three.

242
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,720
Let's see, here is another group of three just like that.

243
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,010
And then, maybe I'll take this group of three like that.

244
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,330
And I'll take this group of three.

245
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,058
There was obviously a much easier way of dividing it up

246
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:38,684
than doing these weird l-shaped things,

247
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,110
but I want to show you it doesn't matter.

248
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,100
You're just dividing it into groups of three.

249
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,780
And how many groups do we have?

250
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,550
We have one group.

251
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,843
Then we have our second group right here.

252
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:53,450
And then we have our third group right there.

253
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,610
And then we have-- let me do it in a new color.

254
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,110
And then we have our fourth group right there.

255
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,900
So we have exactly four groups.

256
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,689
And when I say there was an easier way to divide it,

257
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:08,380
the easier way was obviously-- maybe not obviously--

258
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,688
if I want to divide these into groups of three,

259
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:16,740
I could have just done one, two, three, four groups of three.

260
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,706
Either of these, I'm dividing the twelve objects into packets of three.

261
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,790
You can imagine them that way.

262
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,110
Let's do another one that maybe has a remainder.

263
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,967
Let's see.

264
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:36,348
What is fourteen divided by five?

265
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,580
So let's draw fourteen objects.

266
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:47,390
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

267
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,330
Fourteen objects.

268
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,850
And I'm going to divide it into groups of five.

269
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,510
Well, the easiest thing is there's one group right there,

270
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,930
two groups right there.

271
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,924
But then this last one, I only have four left,

272
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,990
so I can't make another group of five.

273
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,434
So the answer here is I can make two groups of five,

274
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:10,070
and I'm going to have a remainder-- r for remainder-- of four.

275
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,680
Two remainder four.

276
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,505
Now, once you get enough practice,

277
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:16,872
you're not always going to be wanting to draw these circles

278
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,270
and dividing them up like that.

279
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,660
Although that would not be incorrect.

280
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,405
So another way to think about this type of problem

281
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,618
is to say, well, fourteen divided by five, how do I figure that out?

282
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,704
Actually, another way of writing this,

283
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:31,125
and no harm in showing you :

284
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:36,027
I could say fourteen divided by five is the same thing as fourteen divided by--

285
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,502
this sign right here-- divided by five.

286
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,060
And what you do is you say, well, let's see.

287
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,750
How many times does five go into fourteen?

288
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,360
Well, let's see.

289
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,971
Five times-- and you kind of do multiplication tables in your head--

290
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:48,950
Five times one is equal to five.

291
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,860
Five times two is equal to ten.

292
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,960
So that's still less than fourteen, so five goes at least two times.

293
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,140
Five times three is equal to fifteen.

294
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,650
Well that's bigger than fourteen, so I have to go back here.

295
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,980
So five only goes two times.

296
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,630
So it goes two times.

297
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,530
Two times five is ten.

298
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,690
And then you subtract.

299
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,160
You say fourteen minus ten is four.

300
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,090
And that's the same remainder as right here.

301
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,919
Well, I could divide five into fourteen exactly two times,

302
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,578
which would get us two groups of five.

303
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:21,090
Which is essentially just ten.

304
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:28,089
And we still have the four left over.

305
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:28,858
Let me do a couple of more,

306
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:35,765
just to really make sure you get this stuff really, really, really, really well.

307
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,542
Let me write it in that notation.

308
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:41,660
Let's say I do eight divided by two.

309
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,605
And I could also write this as eight--

310
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,529
so I want to know what that is.

311
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,790
That's a question mark.

312
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,100
I could also write this as eight divided by two.

313
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,019
And the way I do either of these-- I'll draw the circles in a second--

314
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,655
but the way I do it without drawing the circles,

315
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:01,219
I say, well, two times one is equal to two.

316
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,683
So that definitely goes into eight,

317
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:06,062
but maybe I can think of a larger number that goes into--

318
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:09,070
that when I multiply it by two still goes into eight.

319
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,360
Two times two is equal to four.

320
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,070
That's still less than eight.

321
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,710
So two times three is equal to six.

322
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,230
Still less than eight.

323
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,430
Two times-- oh, something weird happened to my pen.

324
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,130
Two times four is exactly equal to eight.

325
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,500
So two goes into eight four times.

326
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,750
So I could say two goes into eight four times.

327
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,200
Or eight divided by two is equal to four.

328
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,030
We can even draw our circles.

329
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,490
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

330
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,080
I drew them messy on purpose.

331
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,950
Let's divide them into groups of two.

332
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,240
I have one group of two, two groups of two,

333
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,010
three groups of two, four groups of two.

334
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,170
So if I have eight objects, divide them into groups of two,

335
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,460
you have four groups.

336
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,210
So eight divided by two is four.

337
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,460
Hopefully you found that helpful!

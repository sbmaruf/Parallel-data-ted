1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,750
Use the associative law of
addition to write the

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,800
expression.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,700
We have a 77 plus 2 in
parentheses, plus 3, in a

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,680
different way.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,860
Simplify both expressions
to show they

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,710
have identical results.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,230
So this associative law of
addition, which sounds very

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,460
fancy and complicated, literally
means that you can

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,670
associate these three numbers
in different ways or you can

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,500
add them in different orders.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,760
Now let me just make
that clear.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,920
So the way they wrote it right
here, they wrote it 77 plus 2

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,090
in parentheses, and then
they wrote plus 3.

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,530
These parentheses mean
do the 77 plus 2

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,980
before you add the 3.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,280
So if you were to evaluate
this, you would evaluate

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,930
what's in the parentheses first.
So you would say, well,

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,550
77 plus 2, that's 79, so
everything in the parentheses

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,730
just evaluates to 79.

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,050
And then you still
have that plus 3.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,430
And 79 plus 3 is 82, so
this is equal to 82.

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,690
That's if you just evaluate
it the way that

23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,570
they gave it to us.

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,190
Now, the associative law of
addition tells us it doesn't

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,080
matter whether we add 77 and 2
first or whether we add 2 and

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,860
3 first. We can associate
them differently.

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,590
So this is going to be
the exact same thing.

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,250
This is the exact same
thing as-- we could

29
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,610
write it this way.

30
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,520
Let me write them all.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,765
77 plus 2 plus 3.

32
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:26,090
If we have no parentheses here,
this is actually the

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,750
same thing as this over here,
because we'd go 77 plus 2 is

34
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,430
79 plus 3 is 82.

35
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,510
But the associative law tells
as, well, you know what?

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,380
I could do 77 plus 2 plus 3.

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,430
I could add this first and then
add it to 77, and it's

38
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,970
going to be the exact same thing
as if I added these two

39
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,790
guys first and then add the 3.

40
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,710
Let's verify that
for ourselves.

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:56,240
So 2 plus 3 is 5, so this
evaluates to 77 plus 5.

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,130
And 77 plus 5, once
again, is 82.

43
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,840
So it doesn't matter how you
associate the numbers.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,570
Either way, you get 82.

45
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,729
And that's the associative
law of addition.

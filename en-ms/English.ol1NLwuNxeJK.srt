1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,250
What I want to do in this
video is order these fractions

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,030
from least to greatest.

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,510
And the easiest way
and the way that I

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,485
think we can be sure we'll
get the right answer here

6
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,860
is to find a common denominator,
because if we don't find

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,220
a common denominator,
these fractions are really

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,960
hard to compare.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,750
4/9 versus 3/4 versus
4/5, 11/12, 13/15.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,320
You can try to estimate
them, but you'll

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,830
be able to directly
compare them if they all

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,020
had the same denominator.

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,400
So the trick here, or at
least the first trick here,

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,860
is to try to find that
common denominator.

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,650
And there's many ways to do it.

16
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,390
You could just pick
one of these numbers

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,105
and keep taking its multiples
and find that multiple that

18
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:41,810
is divisible by all the rest.

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,410
Another way to do it is look
at the prime factorization

20
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,790
of each of these numbers.

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,890
And then the least
common multiple of them

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,970
will have to have at least all
of those prime numbers in it.

23
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,990
It has to be composed
of all of these numbers.

24
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,350
So let's do it that second way.

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,610
And then let's verify that
it definitely is divisible.

26
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,700
So 9 is the same
thing as 3 times 3.

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,640
So our least common
multiple is going

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,790
to have at least
one 3 times 3 in it.

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,910
And then 4 is the same
thing as 2 times 2.

30
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,590
So we're going to also
have to have a 2 times 2

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,050
in our prime factorization
of our least common multiple.

32
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,910
5 is a prime number.

33
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,420
So we're going to need
to have a 5 in there.

34
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,660
And then 12-- I'm going
to do that in yellow.

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,710
12 is the same thing
as 2 times 6, which

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,540
is the same thing as 2 times 3.

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,930
And so in our least
common multiple,

38
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,220
we have to have two 2's.

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,730
But we already have two 2's
right over here from our 4.

40
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,710
And we already have
one 3 right over here.

41
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,430
Another way to think about it
is something that is divisible

42
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,742
by both 9 and 4 is going
to be divisible by 12,

43
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,450
because you're going
to have the two 2's.

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,690
And you're going to have
that one 3 right over there.

45
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,720
And then, finally, we need
to be divisible by 15's

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,790
prime factors.

47
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,580
So let's look at
15's prime factors.

48
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,980
15 is the same
thing as 3 times 5.

49
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,640
So once again, this number
right over here already has a 3

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,200
in it.

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,470
And it already has a 5 in it.

52
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,310
So we're cool for 15,
for 12, and, obviously,

53
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,469
for the rest of them.

54
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,010
So this is our least
common multiple.

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,180
And we can just
take this product.

56
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,080
And so this is going to be
equal to 3 times 3 is 9.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,800
9 times 2 is 18.

58
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,370
18 times 2 is 36.

59
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,190
36 times 5, you could do that
in your head if you're like.

60
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,860
But I'll do it on the
side just in case.

61
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,790
36 times 5, just so
that we don't mess up.

62
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,476
6 times 5 is 30.

63
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:44,970
3 times 5 is 15 plus 3 is 180.

64
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,480
So our least common
multiple is 180.

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,630
So we want to rewrite
all of these fractions

66
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,990
with 180 in the denominator.

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,160
So this first fraction,
4/9, is what over 180?

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,600
To go from 9 to 180, we have to
multiply the denominator by 20.

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,160
So let me do it this way.

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,340
So if we do 4/9, to get the
denominator of 9 to be 180,

71
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,346
you have to multiply it by 20.

72
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:15,720
And since we don't
want to change

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,428
the value of the
fraction, we should also

74
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:19,540
multiply the 4 by 20.

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,840
So we're just really
multiplying by 20/20.

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,380
And so 4/9 is going to be
the same thing as 80/180.

77
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,330
Now, let's do the
same thing for 3/4.

78
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,830
Well, what do we have to
multiply the denominator by

79
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,150
to get us to 180?

80
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,600
So it looks like 45.

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,720
You could divide 4 into
180 to figure that out.

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,022
But if you take 4 times
45, 4 times 40 is 160.

83
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:50,124
4 times 5 is 20.

84
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:50,790
You add them up.

85
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,090
You get 180.

86
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,070
So if you multiply
the denominator by 45,

87
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,300
you also have to multiply
the numerator by 45.

88
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,650
3 times 45 is 120 plus 15.

89
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,050
So it's 135.

90
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,510
And the denominator here is 180.

91
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,595
Now, let's do 4/5.

92
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:15,130

93
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,730
To get our
denominator to be 180,

94
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,850
what do you have
to multiply 5 by?

95
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,350
Let's see.

96
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,190
If you multiply 5 by
30, you'll get to 150.

97
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,759
But then you have another 30.

98
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,300
Actually, we know
it right over here.

99
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,690
You have to multiply it by 36.

100
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,630
Well, then you have to multiply
the numerator by 36 as well.

101
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,880
And so our denominator
is going to be 180.

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,782
Our numerator, 4
times 30 is 120.

103
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:42,650
4 times 6 is 24.

104
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,970
So it's 144/180.

105
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,690
And then we have
only two more to do.

106
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,640
So we have our 11/12.

107
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,830

108
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,480
So to get the
denominator to be 180,

109
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,084
we have to multiply 12
by-- so 12 times 10 is 120.

110
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,000
Then you have 60 left.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,690
So you have to multiply it
by 15, 15 In the denominator,

112
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,540
and 15 in the numerator.

113
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,990
And so the denominator
gives us 180.

114
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,480
And 11 times 15.

115
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,190
So 10 times 15 is 150.

116
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,020
And then you have one more 15.

117
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,520
So it's going to be 165.

118
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,473
And then, finally,
we have 13/15.

119
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:32,020

120
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,040
To get our denominator to be
180, have to multiply it by 12.

121
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,585
We already figured out
that 12 times 15 is 180.

122
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,460
So you have to
multiply it by 12.

123
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,872
That will give us 180
in the denominator.

124
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:45,080
And so you have to also
multiply the numerator by 12,

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,310
so that we don't change
the value of the fraction.

126
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,730
We know 12 times 12 is 144.

127
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,430
You could put one
more 12 in there.

128
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,827
You get 156.

129
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:56,660
Did I do that right?

130
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,730
12 plus 144 is going to be 156.

131
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,800
So we've rewritten
each of these fractions

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,870
with that new common
denominator of 180.

133
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,840
And now, it's very
easy to compare them.

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,270
You really just have to
look at the numerators.

135
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,360
So the smallest
of the numerators

136
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,860
is this 80 right over here.

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,500
So 4/9 is the smallest.

138
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,084
4/9 is the least
of these numbers.

139
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,500
So let me just
write it over here.

140
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,520
So this is our ordering.

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,370
We have 4/9 comes first, which
is the same thing as 80/180.

142
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,620
Let me write it
both ways-- 80/180.

143
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,550
Then the next the
smallest number

144
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,210
looks like it's this
135 right over here.

145
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,740

146
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,850
I want to do it in
that same color.

147
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,930
The next one is going to
be that 135/180, which

148
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,660
is the same thing as 3/4.

149
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,740

150
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,430
And then the next one is
going to be-- let's see,

151
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,160
we have the 144/180.

152
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,520
So this is going to
be the 144/180, which

153
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
is the same thing as 4/5.

154
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,150
And then we have two more.

155
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,560
The next is this 156/180.

156
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,020
So then we have
our 156/180, which

157
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,540
is the same thing as 13/15.

158
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,960

159
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,390
And then we have one
left over, the 165/180,

160
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,000
which is the same thing-- I
want to do that in yellow.

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,106
We have our 165/180, which
is the same thing as 11/12.

162
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:35,290

163
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,220
And we're done.

164
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,890
We have finished our ordering.

165
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,980
So if you're doing the Khan
Academy module on this,

166
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,475
this is what you would input
into that little box there.

167
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:47,974

1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,870
In this video I want to do a
bunch of examples of factoring

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,590
a second degree polynomial,
which is

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,870
often called a quadratic.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,650
Sometimes a quadratic
polynomial, or just a

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,850
quadratic itself, or quadratic
expression, but all it means

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,300
is a second degree polynomial.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,440
So something that's going to
have a variable raised to the

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,080
second power.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,460
In this case, in all of the
examples we'll do, it'll be x.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,740
So let's say I have the
quadratic expression, x

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,280
squared plus 10x, plus 9.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,870
And I want to factor it into the
product of two binomials.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,520
How do we do that?

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,440
Well, let's just think about
what happens if we were to

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,690
take x plus a, and multiply
that by x plus b.

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,050
If we were to multiply these
two things, what happens?

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,090
Well, we have a little bit
of experience doing this.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,170
This will be x times x, which is
x squared, plus x times b,

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:12,690
which is bx, plus a times x,
plus a times b-- plus ab.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,800
Or if we want to add these two
in the middle right here,

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,890
because they're both
coefficients of x.

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,102
We could right this as x squared
plus-- I can write it

23
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:29,700
as b plus a, or a plus
b, x, plus ab.

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,390
So in general, if we assume that
this is the product of

25
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,765
two binomials, we see that this
middle coefficient on the

26
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:43,250
x term, or you could say the
first degree coefficient

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,040
there, that's going to be
the sum of our a and b.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
And then the constant term is
going to be the product

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,520
of our a and b.

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,290
Notice, this would map
to this, and this

31
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,790
would map to this.

32
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,600
And, of course, this is the
same thing as this.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,590
So can we somehow pattern
match this to that?

34
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:14,060
Is there some a and b where
a plus b is equal to 10?

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:22,070
And a times b is equal to 9?

36
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,850
Well, let's just think about
it a little bit.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,470
What are the factors of 9?

38
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,770
What are the things that a
and b could be equal to?

39
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,170
And we're assuming that
everything is an integer.

40
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,350
And normally when we're
factoring, especially when

41
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,950
we're beginning to factor,
we're dealing

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,580
with integer numbers.

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,080
So what are the factors of 9?

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,730
They're 1, 3, and 9.

45
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,000
So this could be a 3 and a 3,
or it could be a 1 and a 9.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,630
Now, if it's a 3 and a 3, then
you'll have 3 plus 3-- that

47
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,840
doesn't equal 10.

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,760
But if it's a 1 and a
9, 1 times 9 is 9.

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,670
1 plus 9 is 10.

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,570
So it does work.

51
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,190
So a could be equal to 1, and
b could be equal to 9.

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,920
So we could factor this
as being x plus 1,

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,970
times x plus 9.

54
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,850
And if you multiply these two
out, using the skills we

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,970
developed in the last few
videos, you'll see that it is

56
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,880
indeed x squared plus
10x, plus 9.

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,150
So when you see something like
this, when the coefficient on

58
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,070
the x squared term, or the
leading coefficient on this

59
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,650
quadratic is a 1, you can just
say, all right, what two

60
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,530
numbers add up to this
coefficient right here?

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,870
And those same two numbers, when
you take their product,

62
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,660
have to be equal to 9.

63
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,510
And of course, this has to
be in standard form.

64
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,000
Or if it's not in standard form,
you should put it in

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
that form, so that you can
always say, OK, whatever's on

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,530
the first degree coefficient,
my a and b

67
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,300
have to add to that.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,890
Whatever's my constant term, my
a times b, the product has

69
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,370
to be that.

70
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,150
Let's do several
more examples.

71
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,510
I think the more examples
we do the more

72
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,630
sense this'll make.

73
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,700
Let's say we had x squared
plus 10x, plus-- well, I

74
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,100
already did 10x, let's do a
different number-- x squared

75
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,366
plus 15x, plus 50.

76
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,470
And we want to factor this.

77
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,339
Well, same drill.

78
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,600
We have an x squared term.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,130
We have a first degree term.

80
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,960
This right here should be
the sum of two numbers.

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,620
And then this term, the constant
term right here,

82
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,870
should be the product
of two numbers.

83
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,640
So we need to think of two
numbers that, when I multiply

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,220
them I get 50, and when
I add them, I get 15.

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,910
And this is going to be a bit of
an art that you're going to

86
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,530
develop, but the more practice
you do, you're going to see

87
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,730
that it'll start to
come naturally.

88
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,330
So what could a and b be?

89
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,975
Let's think about the
factors of 50.

90
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:52,230
It could be 1 times 50.

91
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,072
2 times 25.

92
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,520
Let's see, 4 doesn't
go into 50.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,450
It could be 5 times 10.

94
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,580
I think that's all of them.

95
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,920
Let's try out these numbers,
and see if any of

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,310
these add up to 15.

97
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,630
So 1 plus 50 does not
add up to 15.

98
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,160
2 plus 25 does not
add up to 15.

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,260
But 5 plus 10 does
add up to 15.

100
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,280
So this could be 5 plus 10, and
this could be 5 times 10.

101
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,760
So if we were to factor this,
this would be equal to x plus

102
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,630
5, times x plus 10.

103
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,840
And multiply it out.

104
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,710
I encourage you to multiply this
out, and see that this is

105
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,660
indeed x squared plus
15x, plus 10.

106
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,320
In fact, let's do it. x
times x, x squared. x

107
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,800
times 10, plus 10x.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
5 times x, plus 5x.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,620
5 times 10, plus 50.

110
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,220
Notice, the 5 times
10 gave us the 50.

111
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,890
The 5x plus the 10x is giving
us the 15x in between.

112
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,560
So it's x squared plus
15x, plus 50.

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,440
Let's up the stakes a little
bit, introduce some negative

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,040
signs in here.

115
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,890
Let's say I had x squared
minus 11x, plus 24.

116
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,610
Now, it's the exact
same principle.

117
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,580
I need to think of two numbers,
that when I add them,

118
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,570
need to be equal
to negative 11.

119
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,150
a plus b need to be equal
to negative 11.

120
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,900
And a times b need to
be equal to 24.

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,290
Now, there's something for
you to think about.

122
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,960
When I multiply both of these
numbers, I'm getting a

123
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
positive number.

124
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm getting a 24.

125
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,260
That means that both of these
need to be positive, or both

126
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,380
of these need to be negative.

127
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,050
That's the only way I'm going to
get a positive number here.

128
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,290
Now, if when I add them, I get
a negative number, if these

129
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,720
were positive, there's no way I
can add two positive numbers

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
and get a negative number, so
the fact that their sum is

131
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,750
negative, and the fact that
their product is positive,

132
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,420
tells me that both a
and b are negative.

133
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,200
a and b have to be negative.

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,730
Remember, one can't be negative
and the other one

135
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,710
can't be positive, because the
product would be negative.

136
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,687
And they both can't be positive,
because when you add

137
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,520
them it would get you
a positive number.

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,500
So let's just think about
what a and b can be.

139
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,990
So two negative numbers.

140
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,260
So let's think about
the factors of 24.

141
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,140
And we'll kind of have to think
of the negative factors.

142
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:44,670
But let me see, it could be 1
times 24, 2 times 11, 3 times

143
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,070
8, or 4 times 6.

144
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,220
Now, which of these when I
multiply these-- well,

145
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,380
obviously when I multiply
1 times 24, I get 24.

146
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,910
When I get 2 times 11-- sorry,
this is 2 times 12.

147
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,790
I get 24.

148
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,090
So we know that all these,
the products are 24.

149
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,470
But which two of these, which
two factors, when I add them,

150
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,790
should I get 11?

151
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,880
And then we could say,
let's take the

152
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,450
negative of both of those.

153
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,470
So when you look at these,
3 and 8 jump out.

154
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,150
3 times 8 is equal to 24.

155
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,810
3 plus 8 is equal to 11.

156
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,680
But that doesn't quite
work out, right?

157
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,510
Because we have a negative
11 here.

158
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,690
But what if we did negative
3 and negative 8?

159
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:37,789
Negative 3 times negative 8
is equal to positive 24.

160
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,580
Negative 3 plus negative 8
is equal to negative 11.

161
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,600
So negative 3 and
negative 8 work.

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,840
So if we factor this, x squared
minus 11x, plus 24 is

163
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:02,940
going to be equal to x minus
3, times x minus 8.

164
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,270
Let's do another
one like that.

165
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,330
Actually, let's mix it
up a little bit.

166
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:19,810
Let's say I had x squared
plus 5x, minus 14.

167
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,770
So here we have a different
situation.

168
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,460
The product of my two numbers is
negative, right? a times b

169
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,190
is equal to negative 14.

170
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,920
My product is negative.

171
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,930
That tells me that one of them
is positive, and one of them

172
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,910
is negative.

173
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,200
And when I add the two, a plus
b, it'd be equal to 5.

174
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
So let's think about
the factors of 14.

175
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,300
And what combinations of them,
when I add them, if one is

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,560
positive and one is negative,
or I'm really kind of taking

177
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,780
the difference of the
two, do I get 5?

178
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,450
So if I take 1 and 14-- I'm just
going to try out things--

179
00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:01,820
1 and 14, negative 1 plus
14 is negative 13.

180
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,260
Negative 1 plus 14 is 13.

181
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,430
So let me write all of the
combinations that I could do.

182
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,440
And eventually your brain
will just zone in on it.

183
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,490
So you've got negative 1
plus 14 is equal to 13.

184
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,460
And 1 plus negative 14 is
equal to negative 13.

185
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,380
So those don't work.

186
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,950
That doesn't equal 5.

187
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,860
Now what about 2 and 7?

188
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,600
If I do negative 2-- let me do
this in a different color-- if

189
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,290
I do negative 2 plus 7,
that is equal to 5.

190
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,750
We're done!

191
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,670
That worked!

192
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,440
I mean, we could have tried 2
plus negative 7, but that'd be

193
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,070
equal to negative 5, so that
wouldn't have worked.

194
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,960
But negative 2 plus 7 works.

195
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,590
And negative 2 times
7 is negative 14.

196
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,600
So there we have it.

197
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,210
We know it's x minus
2, times x plus 7.

198
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,330
That's pretty neat.

199
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,950
Negative 2 times 7
is negative 14.

200
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,880
Negative 2 plus 7
is positive 5.

201
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,680
Let's do several more of these,
just to really get well

202
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,520
honed this skill.

203
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:16,360
So let's say we have x squared
minus x, minus 56.

204
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,570
So the product of the two
numbers have to be minus 56,

205
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,620
have to be negative 56.

206
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,430
And their difference, because
one is going to be positive,

207
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,280
and one is going to be
negative, right?

208
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,350
Their difference has
to be negative 1.

209
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,130
And the numbers that immediately
jump out in my

210
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,900
brain-- and I don't know if they
jump out in your brain,

211
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,740
we just learned this in
the times tables--

212
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,480
56 is 8 times 7.

213
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
I mean, there's other numbers.

214
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,950
It's also 28 times 2.

215
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,140
It's all sorts of things.

216
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,300
But 8 times 7 really jumped
out into my brain, because

217
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,470
they're very close
to each other.

218
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,730
And we need numbers that are
very close to each other.

219
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,430
And one of these has to be
positive, and one of these has

220
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,810
to be negative.

221
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,250
Now, the fact that when their
sum is negative, tells me that

222
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,460
the larger of these two should
probably be negative.

223
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,350
So if we take negative
8 times 7, that's

224
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,320
equal to negative 56.

225
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,470
And then if we take negative
8 plus 7, that is equal to

226
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,100
negative 1, which is exactly the
coefficient right there.

227
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,490
So when I factor this, this
is going to be x minus 8,

228
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,690
times x plus 7.

229
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,695
This is often one of the hardest
concepts people learn

230
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:23,920
in algebra, because it
is a bit of an art.

231
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,710
You have to look at all of the
factors here, play with the

232
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,710
positive and negative signs,
see which of those factors

233
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,900
when one is positive, one is
negative, add up to the

234
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,590
coefficient on the x term.

235
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,860
But as you do more and more
practice, you'll see that

236
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,280
it'll become a bit
of second nature.

237
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,350
Now let's step up the stakes
a little bit more.

238
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's say we had negative x
squared-- everything we've

239
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,040
done so far had a positive
coefficient, a positive 1

240
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,690
coefficient on the
x squared term.

241
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,590
But let's say we had a
negative x squared

242
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,440
minus 5x, plus 24.

243
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,910
How do we do this?

244
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,420
Well, the easiest way I can
think of doing it is factor

245
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,670
out a negative 1, and then it
becomes just like the problems

246
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,260
we've been doing before.

247
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,660
So this is the same thing as
negative 1 times positive x

248
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,990
squared, plus 5x, minus 24.

249
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,300
Right?

250
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,080
I just factored a
negative 1 out.

251
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,180
You can multiply negative 1
times all of these, and you'll

252
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,690
see it becomes this.

253
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,555
Or you could factor the negative
1 out and divide all

254
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,000
of these by negative 1.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
And you get that right there.

256
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,360
Now, same game as before.

257
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,510
I need two numbers, that when
I take their product I get

258
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,690
negative 24.

259
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,125
So one will be positive,
one will be negative.

260
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,770
When I take their sum,
it's going to be 5.

261
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,850
So let's think about
24 is 1 and 24.

262
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:55,750
Let's see, if this is negative 1
and 24, it'd be positive 23,

263
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,540
if it was the other way around,
it'd be negative 23.

264
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,500
Doesn't work.

265
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,210
What about 2 and 12?

266
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,530
Well, if this is negative--
remember, one of these has to

267
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,040
be negative.

268
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,570
If the 2 is negative, their
sum would be 10.

269
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,750
If the 12 is negative, their
sum would be negative 10.

270
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,300
Still doesn't work.

271
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,290
3 and 8.

272
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,850
If the 3 is negative,
their sum will be 5.

273
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,910
So it works!

274
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,620
So if we pick negative 3 and
8, negative 3 and 8 work.

275
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,630
Because negative
3 plus 8 is 5.

276
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,510
Negative 3 times 8
is negative 24.

277
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,640
So this is going to be equal
to-- can't forget that

278
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,230
negative 1 out front, and then
we factor the inside.

279
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:42,990
Negative 1 times x minus
3, times x plus 8.

280
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,800
And if you really wanted to,
you could multiply the

281
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,450
negative 1 times this,
you would get 3

282
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,560
minus x if you did.

283
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,810
Or you don't have to.

284
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,220
Let's do one more of these.

285
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,060
The more practice, the
better, I think.

286
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,630
All right, let's say I had
negative x squared

287
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,690
plus 18x, minus 72.

288
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,320
So once again, I like to factor
out the negative 1.

289
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,040
So this is equal to negative
1 times x squared,

290
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,910
minus 18x, plus 72.

291
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,650
Now we just have to think of
two numbers, that when I

292
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,330
multiply them I get
positive 72.

293
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,480
So they have to be
the same sign.

294
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,930
And that makes it easier in our
head, at least in my head.

295
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,260
When I multiply them,
I get positive 72.

296
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,040
When I add them, I
get negative 18.

297
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,410
So they're the same sign, and
their sum is a negative

298
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,470
number, they both must
be negative.

299
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,790
And we could go through all
of the factors of 72.

300
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,510
But the one that springs up,
maybe you think of 8 times 9,

301
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,270
but 8 times 9, or negative 8
minus 9, or negative 8 plus

302
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,210
negative 9, doesn't work.

303
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,060
That turns into 17.

304
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,860
That was close.

305
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,560
Let me show you that.

306
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,400
Negative 9 plus negative 8, that
is equal to negative 17.

307
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,140
Close, but no cigar.

308
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,990
So what other ones are there?

309
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,005
We have 6 and 12.

310
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,705
That actually seems
pretty good.

311
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:13,710
If we have negative 6 plus
negative 12, that is equal to

312
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,360
negative 18.

313
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,590
Notice, it's a bit of an art.

314
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,810
You have to try the different
factors here.

315
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,360
So this will become negative
1-- don't want to forget

316
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,440
that-- times x minus 6,
times x minus 12.

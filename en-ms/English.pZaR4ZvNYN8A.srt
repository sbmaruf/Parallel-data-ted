1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,064
Considering that I have a cold right now I can't imagine a more appropriate topic to make a video on than

2
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,164
a virus

3
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:09,242
Don't make it that thick.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,380
A virus, or viruses.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,920
Viruses.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
And in my opinion, viruses are,
on some level, the most

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,450
fascinating thing in
all of biology.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,560
Because they really blur the
boundary between what is an

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,440
inanimate object and
what is life?

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,410
I mean if we look at ourselves,
or life as one of

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,210
those things that you know
it when you see it.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,300
If you see something that,
it's born, it grows, it's

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,460
constantly changing.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,510
Maybe it moves around.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,260
Maybe it doesn't.

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,400
But it's metabolizing things
around itself.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,310
It reproduces and
then it dies.

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,300
You say, hey, that's
probably life.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,960
And in this, we throw most
things that we see-- or we

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,815
throw in, us.

21
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:55,360
We throw in bacteria.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
We throw in plants.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,830
I mean, I could-- I'm kind of
butchering the taxonomy system

24
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,275
here, but we tend to know
life when we see it.

25
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:07,480
But all viruses are, they're
just a bunch of genetic

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,740
information inside
of a protein.

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,230
Inside of a protein capsule.

28
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,490
So let me draw.

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,340
And the genetic information
can come in any form.

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,240
So it can be an RNA, it could
be DNA, it could be

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,670
single-stranded RNA,
double-stranded RNA.

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,260
Sometimes for single stranded
they'll write these two little

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,250
S's in front of it.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,950
Let's say they are talking about
double stranded DNA,

35
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,910
they'll put a ds
in front of it.

36
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,330
But the general idea-- and
viruses can come in all of

37
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,110
these forms-- is that they have
some genetic information,

38
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,530
some chain of nucleic acids.

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,730
Either as single or double
stranded RNA or single or

40
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,560
double stranded DNA.

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,970
And it's just contained inside
some type of protein

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,880
structure, which is
called the capsid.

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,240
And kind of the classic
drawing is kind of an

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,650
icosahedron type
looking thing.

45
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,200
Let me see if I can
do justice to it.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,610
It looks something like this.

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,800
And not all viruses have to
look exactly like this.

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,160
There's thousands of
types of viruses.

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,850
And we're really just scratching
the surface and

50
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,630
understanding even what viruses
are out there and all

51
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,800
of the different ways that they
can essentially replicate

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,220
themselves.

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,620
We'll talk more about
that in the future.

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,110
And I would suspect that pretty
much any possible way

55
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,530
of replication probably
does somehow exist

56
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,750
in the virus world.

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,260
But they really are just these
proteins, these protein

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,450
capsids, are just made up
of a bunch of little

59
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,070
proteins put together.

60
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,250
And inside they have some
genetic material, which might

61
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,700
be DNA or it might be RNA.

62
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,870
So let me draw their
genetic material.

63
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,420
The protein is not necessarily
transparent, but if it was,

64
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,960
you would see some genetic
material inside of there.

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,440
So the question is, is
this thing life?

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,580
It seems pretty inanimate.

67
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,540
It doesn't grow.

68
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,510
It doesn't change.

69
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,200
It doesn't metabolize things.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
This thing, left to its
own devices, is just

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,850
going to sit there.

72
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,600
It's just going to sit there the
way a book on a table just

73
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,690
sits there.

74
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,280
It won't change anything.

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,560
But what happens is,
the debate arises.

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,470
I mean you might say, hey Sal,
when you define it that way,

77
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,690
just looks like a bunch of
molecules put together.

78
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,740
That isn't life.

79
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,350
But it starts to seem like life
all of a sudden when it

80
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,100
comes in contact with the
things that we normally

81
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,220
consider life.

82
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,480
So what viruses do, the classic
example is, a virus

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,680
will attach itself to a cell.

84
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,590
So let me draw this thing
a little bit smaller.

85
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,260
So let's say that this
is my virus.

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,562
I'll draw it as a
little hexagon.

87
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,980
And what it does is, it'll
attach itself to a cell.

88
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,795
And it could be any
type of cell.

89
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:39,155
It could be a bacteria cell, it
could be a plant cell, it

90
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,190
could be a human cell.

91
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,820
Let me draw the cell here.

92
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,540
Cells are usually far larger
than the virus.

93
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,610
In the case of cells that have
soft membranes, the virus

94
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,850
figures out some way
to enter it.

95
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,780
Sometimes it can essentially
fuse-- I don't want to

96
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,390
complicate the issue-- but
sometimes viruses have their

97
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,480
own little membranes.

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,740
And we'll talk about
in a second where

99
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,760
it gets their membranes.

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,270
So a virus might have its
own membrane like that.

101
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,520
That's around its capsid.

102
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,470
And then these membranes
will fuse.

103
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,785
And then the virus will be able
to enter into the cell.

104
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, that's one method.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,670
And another method,
and they're seldom

106
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,589
all the same way.

107
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,020
But let's say another method
would be, the virus

108
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,910
convinces-- just based on some
protein receptors on it, or

109
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,810
protein receptors on the cells--
and obviously this has

110
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,650
to be kind of a Trojan
horse type of thing.

111
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,600
The cell doesn't want viruses.

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,390
So the virus has to somehow
convince the cell that it's a

113
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,050
non-foreign particle.

114
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,770
We could do hundreds of videos
on how viruses work and it's a

115
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,430
continuing field of research.

116
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,580
But sometimes you might have a
virus that just gets consumed

117
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,120
by the cell.

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,930
Maybe the cell just thinks it's
something that it needs

119
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,960
to consume.

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,130
So the cell wraps around
it like this.

121
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,930
And these sides will
eventually merge.

122
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,670
And then the cell and the
virus will go into it.

123
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,160
This is called endocytosis.

124
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,020
I'll just talk about that.

125
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,640
It just brings it into
its cytoplasm.

126
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,020
It doesn't happen
just to viruses.

127
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,890
But this is one mechanism
that can enter.

128
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,320
And then in cases where the cell
in question-- for example

129
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,280
in the situation with bacteria--
if the cell has a

130
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,520
very hard shell-- let me
do it in a good color.

131
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,040
So let's say that this is
a bacteria right here.

132
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,510
And it has a hard shell.

133
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,830
The viruses don't even
enter the cell.

134
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,440
They just hang out outside
of the cell like this.

135
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,740
Not drawing to scale.

136
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,690
And they actually inject
their genetic material.

137
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,790
So there's obviously a huge--
there's a wide variety of ways

138
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,680
of how the viruses
get into cells.

139
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,780
But that's beside the point.

140
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,420
The interesting thing is that
they do get into the cell.

141
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,240
And once they do get into the
cell, they release their

142
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,570
genetic material
into the cell.

143
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,970
So their genetic material
will float around.

144
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,390
If their genetic material is
already in the form of RNA--

145
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,700
and I could imagine almost every
possibility of different

146
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,160
ways for viruses to work
probably do exist in nature.

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,400
We just haven't found them.

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,630
But the ones that we've already
found really do kind

149
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,880
of do it in every
possible way.

150
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,720
So if they have RNA, this RNA
can immediately start being

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,170
used to essentially-- let's
say this is the

152
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,540
nucleus of the cell.

153
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,850
That's the nucleus of the cell
and it normally has the DNA in

154
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,480
it like that.

155
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,720
Maybe I'll do the DNA in
a different color.

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,260
But DNA gets transcribed
into RNA, normally.

157
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,940
So normally, the cell, this a
normal working cell, the RNA

158
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,540
exits the nucleus, it goes to
the ribosomes, and then you

159
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,690
have the RNA in conjunction with
the tRNA and it produces

160
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,260
these proteins.

161
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,030
The RNA codes for different
proteins.

162
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,670
And I talk about that in
a different video.

163
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,000
So these proteins get formed and
eventually, they can form

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
the different structures
in a cell.

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,190
But what a virus does is it
hijacks this process here.

166
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,490
Hijacks this mechanism.

167
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,550
This RNA will essentially go and
do what the cell's own RNA

168
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,230
would have done.

169
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,140
And it starts coding for
its own proteins.

170
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,250
Obviously it's not
going to code for

171
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,260
the same things there.

172
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,790
And actually some of the first
proteins it codes for often

173
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,670
start killing the DNA and the
RNA that might otherwise

174
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,380
compete with it.

175
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,390
So it codes its own proteins.

176
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,860
And then those proteins start
making more viral shells.

177
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,520
So those proteins just start
constructing more and more

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
viral shells.

179
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
At the same time, this
RNA is replicating.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,730
It's using the cell's own
mechanisms. Left to its own

181
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,820
devices it would
just sit there.

182
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,800
But once it enters into a cell
it can use all of the nice

183
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,000
machinery that a cell has around
to replicate itself.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,360
And it's kind of amazing, just
the biochemistry of it.

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,810
That these RNA molecules
then find themselves

186
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,470
back in these capsids.

187
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,290
And then once there's enough
of these and the cell has

188
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,620
essentially all of its resources
have been depleted,

189
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,990
the viruses, these individual
new viruses that have

190
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,410
replicated themselves using all
of the cell's mechanisms,

191
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,370
will find some way
to exit the cell.

192
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,860
The most-- I don't want to
say, typical, because we

193
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,110
haven't even discovered all the
different types of viruses

194
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,750
there are-- but one that's, I
guess, talked about the most,

195
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,760
is when there's enough of
these, they'll release

196
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,880
proteins or they'll construct
proteins.

197
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,390
Because they don't
make their own.

198
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,860
That essentially cause the cell
to either kill itself or

199
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,140
its membrane to dissolve.

200
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,260
So the membrane dissolves.

201
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,480
And essentially the
cell lyses.

202
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,409
Let me write that down.

203
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,840
The cell lyses.

204
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,110
And lyses just means that
the cell's membrane just

205
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,900
disappears.

206
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,480
And then all of these guys can
emerge for themselves.

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,470
Now I talked about before that
have some of these guys, that

208
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,750
they have their own membrane.

209
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,710
So how did they get
there, these

210
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,400
kind of bilipid membranes?

211
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,900
Well some of them, what they
do is, once they replicate

212
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,380
inside of a cell, they exit
maybe not even killing-- they

213
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,650
don't have to lyse.

214
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,620
Everything I talk about, these
are specific ways that a virus

215
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,150
might work.

216
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,630
But viruses really kind of
explore-- well different types

217
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,620
of viruses do almost every
different combination you

218
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,610
could imagine of replicating
and coding for proteins and

219
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,400
escaping from cells.

220
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
Some of them just bud.

221
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
And when they bud, they
essentially, you can kind of

222
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,070
imagine that they push
against the cell

223
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,670
wall, or the membrane.

224
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,740
I shouldn't say cell wall.

225
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,630
The cell's outer membrane.

226
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,130
And then when they push against
it, they take some of

227
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,070
the membrane with them.

228
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,260
Until eventually the cell
will-- when this goes up

229
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,810
enough, this'll pop together
and it'll take some of the

230
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,565
membrane with it.

231
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:47,280
And you could imagine why that
would be useful thing

232
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,030
to have with you.

233
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,260
Because now that you have this
membrane, you kind of look

234
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,520
like this cell.

235
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,300
So when you want to go infect
another cell like this, you're

236
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,530
not going to necessarily look
like a foreign particle.

237
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,780
So it's a very useful way to
look like something that

238
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,470
you're not.

239
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,940
And if you don't think that this
is creepy-crawly enough,

240
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,780
that you're hijacking the DNA
of an organism, viruses can

241
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,740
actually change the
DNA an organism.

242
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,830
And actually one of the most
common examples is HIV virus.

243
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,480
Let me write that down.

244
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,480
HIV, which is a type of
retrovirus, which is

245
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,280
fascinating.

246
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,930
Because what they do is, so
they have RNA in them.

247
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,030
And when they enter into a cell,
let's say that they got

248
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,430
into the cell.

249
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,950
So it's inside of the
cell like this.

250
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,570
They actually bring along
with them a protein.

251
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,600
And every time you say, where
do they get this protein?

252
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,390
All of this stuff came from
a different cell.

253
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,490
They use some other cell's amino
acids and ribosomes and

254
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,800
nucleic acids and everything
to build themselves.

255
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,780
So any proteins that they
have in them came

256
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,080
from another cell.

257
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,610
But they bring with them, this
protein reverse transcriptase.

258
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,850
And the reverse transcriptase
takes their RNA and

259
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,490
codes it into DNA.

260
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,790
So its RNA to DNA.

261
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,810
Which when it was first
discovered was, kind of,

262
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,950
people always thought that you
always went from DNA to RNA,

263
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,110
but this kind of broke
that paradigm.

264
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,850
But it codes from RNA to DNA.

265
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,020
And if that's not bad enough,
it'll incorporate that DNA

266
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,350
into the DNA of the host cell.

267
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,500
So that DNA will incorporate
itself into the

268
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,200
DNA of the host cell.

269
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,690
Let's say the yellow is the
DNA of the host cell.

270
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,000
And this is its nucleus.

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,070
So it actually messes with
the genetic makeup

272
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,030
of what it's infecting.

273
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,570
And when I made the videos on
bacteria I said, hey for every

274
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,790
one human cell we have twenty
bacteria cells.

275
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,420
And they live with us and
they're useful and they're

276
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,100
part of us and they're 10% of
our dry mass and all of that.

277
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,170
But bacteria are kind of
along for the ride.

278
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,860
They don't change who we are.

279
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,010
But these retroviruses, they're
actually changing our

280
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,940
genetic makeup.

281
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,650
I mean, my genes, I take
very personally.

282
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,380
They define who I am.

283
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,630
But these guys will
actually go in and

284
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,240
change my genetic makeup.

285
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,300
And then once they're part of
the DNA, then just the natural

286
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,330
DNA to RNA to protein
process will code

287
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,180
their actual proteins.

288
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,160
Or their-- what they need to--
so sometimes they'll lay

289
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,420
dormant and do nothing.

290
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,730
And sometimes-- let's say
sometimes in some type of

291
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,790
environmental trigger,
they'll start coding

292
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,110
for themselves again.

293
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,620
And they'll start
producing more.

294
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,980
But they're producing it
directly from the organism's

295
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,110
cell's DNA.

296
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,120
They become part of
the organism.

297
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,280
I mean I can't imagine a more
intimate way to become part of

298
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,530
an organism than to become
part of its DNA.

299
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,870
I can't imagine any
other way to

300
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,680
actually define an organism.

301
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,910
And if this by itself is not
eerie enough, and just so you

302
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,770
know, this notion right here,
when a virus becomes part of

303
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,430
an organism's DNA, this
is called a provirus.

304
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,890
But if this isn't eerie enough,
they estimate-- so if

305
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:23,500
this infects a cell in my nose
or in my arm, as this cell

306
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,250
experiences mitosis, all of
its offspring-- but its

307
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,030
offspring are genetically
identical-- are going to have

308
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,600
this viral DNA.

309
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,060
And that might be fine,
but at least my

310
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,120
children won't get it.

311
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,980
You know, at least it won't
become part of my species.

312
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,710
But it doesn't have to just
infect somatic cells, it could

313
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,170
infect a germ cell.

314
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,510
So it could go into
a germ cell.

315
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,850
And the germ cells, we've
learned already, these are the

316
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,380
ones that produce gametes.

317
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,930
For men, that's sperm and
for women it's eggs.

318
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,180
But you could imagine, once
you've infected a germ cell,

319
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,010
once you become part of a germ
cell's DNA, then I'm passing

320
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,600
on that viral DNA to my
son or my daughter.

321
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,540
And they are going to pass
it on to their children.

322
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,260
And just that idea by itself
is, at least to my mind.

323
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,130
vaguely creepy.

324
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,050
And people estimate that 5-8%--
and this kind of really

325
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,480
blurs, it makes you think about
what we as humans really

326
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,800
are-- but the estimate is 5-8%
of the human genome-- so when

327
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,500
I talked about bacteria I just
talked about things that were

328
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,850
along for the ride.

329
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,240
But the current estimate, and
I looked up this a lot.

330
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,210
I found 8% someplace,
5% someplace.

331
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:35,990
It's all a guess.

332
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,650
I mean people are doing it based
on just looking at the

333
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,690
DNA and how similar it is to
DNA in other organisms. But

334
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:47,390
the estimate is 5-8% of the
human genome is from viruses,

335
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,760
is from ancient retroviruses
that incorporated themselves

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,530
into the human germ line.

337
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,725
So into the human DNA.

338
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,860
So these are called endogenous
retroviruses.

339
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,150
Which is mind blowing to me,
because it's not just saying

340
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,290
these things are along for the
ride or that they might help

341
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,070
us or hurt us.

342
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,000
It's saying that we are--
5-8% of our DNA

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,390
actually comes from viruses.

344
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,850
And this is another thing
that speaks to

345
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,720
just genetic variation.

346
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,210
Because viruses do something--
I mean this is called

347
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,760
horizontal transfer of DNA.

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,480
And you could imagine, as a
virus goes from one species to

349
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,220
the next, as it goes from
Species A to B, if it mutates

350
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,310
to be able to infiltrate these
cells, it might take some--

351
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,810
it'll take the DNA that
it already has, that

352
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,490
makes it, it with it.

353
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,180
But sometimes, when it starts
coding for some of these other

354
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,830
guys, so let's say that this
is a provirus right here.

355
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,860
Where the blue part is
the original virus.

356
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,960
The yellow is the organism's
historic DNA.

357
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,230
Sometimes when it codes, it
takes up little sections of

358
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,200
the other organism's DNA.

359
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,810
So maybe most of it was the
viral DNA, but it might have,

360
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,070
when it transcribed and
translated itself, it might

361
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,710
have taken a little bit-- or at
least when it translated or

362
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,460
replicated itself-- it might
take a little bit of the

363
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,540
organism's previous DNA.

364
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,690
So it's actually cutting parts
of DNA from one organism and

365
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,950
bringing it to another
organism.

366
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,490
Taking it from one member of a
species to another member of

367
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:27,810
the species.

368
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,750
But it can definitely
go cross-species.

369
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,860
So you have this idea all of
a sudden that DNA can jump

370
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,090
between species.

371
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,410
It really kind of-- I don't
know, for me it makes me

372
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,930
appreciate how interconnected--
as a species,

373
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,950
we kind of imagine that we're
by ourselves and can only

374
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,110
reproduce with each other and
have genetic variation within

375
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,860
a population.

376
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,190
But viruses introduce this
notion of horizontal transfer

377
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,090
via transduction.

378
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,640
Horizontal transduction is just
the idea of, look when I

379
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,660
replicate this virus, I might
take a little bit of the

380
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,349
organism that I'm freeloading
off of, I might take a little

381
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,010
bit of their DNA with me.

382
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,160
And infect that DNA into
the next organism.

383
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,329
So you actually have this
DNA, this jumping,

384
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,119
from organism to organism.

385
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,300
So it kind of unifies
all DNA-based life.

386
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,609
Which is all the life that
we know on the planet.

387
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,900
And if all of this isn't creepy
enough-- and actually

388
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,540
maybe I'll save the creepiest
part for the end.

389
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,800
But there's a whole-- we could
talk all about the different

390
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,670
classes of viruses.

391
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,810
But just so you're familiar with
some of the terminology,

392
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,895
when a virus attacks bacteria,
which they often do.

393
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:41,150
And we study these the most
because this might be a good

394
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,630
alternative to antibiotics.

395
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,430
Because viruses that attack
bacteria might-- sometimes the

396
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,820
bacteria is far worse for the
virus-- but these are called

397
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,070
bacteriaphages.

398
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,320
And I've already talked to you
about how they have their DNA.

399
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,890
But since bacteria have hard
walls, they will just inject

400
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,940
the DNA inside of
the bacteria.

401
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,630
And when you talk about DNA,
this idea of a provirus.

402
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,170
So when a virus lyses it
like this, this is

403
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,090
called the lytic cycle.

404
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,760
This is just some terminology
that's good to know if you're

405
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,250
going to take a biology
exam about this stuff.

406
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,600
And when the virus incorporates
it into the DNA

407
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,350
and lays dormant, incorporates
into the DNA of the host

408
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,420
organism and lays dormant for
awhile, this is called the

409
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,030
lysogenic cycle.

410
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,030
And normally, a provirus is
essentially experiencing a

411
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,910
lysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes,
in organisms that

412
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,250
have a nuclear membrane.

413
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,890
Normally when people talk about
the lysogenic cycle,

414
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,750
they're talking about viral DNA
laying dormant in the DNA

415
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,600
of bacteria.

416
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Or bacteriophage DNA
laying dormant

417
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,050
in the DNA of bacteria.

418
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,380
But just to kind of give you
an idea of what this, quote

419
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,480
unquote, looks like,
right here.

420
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,550
I got these two pictures
from Wikipedia.

421
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,800
One is from the CDC.

422
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,200
These little green dots you see
right here all over the

423
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,540
surface, this big thing you
see here, this is a white

424
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,330
blood cell.

425
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,760
Part of the human
immune system.

426
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,050
This is a white blood cell.

427
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,060
And what you see emerging from
the surface, essentially

428
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,510
budding from the surface of this
white blood cell-- and

429
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,300
this gives you a sense
of scale too--

430
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,700
these are HIV-1 viruses.

431
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,970
And so you're familiar with the
terminology, the HIV is a

432
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,810
virus that infects white
blood cells.

433
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,890
AIDS is the syndrome you get
once your immune system is

434
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,900
weakened to the point.

435
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,860
And then many people suffer
infections that people with a

436
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,450
strong immune system normally
won't suffer from.

437
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,050
But this is creepy.

438
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,360
These things went inside this
huge cell, they used the

439
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,555
cell's own mechanism to
reproduce its own DNA or its

440
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:14,300
own RNA and these
protein capsids.

441
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,270
And then they bud from the cell
and take a little bit of

442
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,490
the membrane with it.

443
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,990
And they can even leave some
of their DNA behind in this

444
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,340
cell's own DNA.

445
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,280
So they really change what
the cell is all about.

446
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,890
This is another creepy
picture.

447
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,140
These are bacteriaphages.

448
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,110
And these show you what
I said before.

449
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,450
This is a bacteria right here.

450
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,360
This is its cell wall.

451
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,100
And it's hard.

452
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,020
So it's hard to just
emerge into it.

453
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,040
Or you can't just merge,
fuse membranes with it.

454
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,290
So they hang out on the outside
of this bacteria.

455
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,410
And they are essentially
injecting their genetic

456
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,280
material into the
bacteria itself.

457
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,890
And you could imagine,
just looking at the

458
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,000
size of these things.

459
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,090
I mean, this is a cell.

460
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,350
And it looks like a whole
planet or something.

461
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,650
Or this is a bacteria and these

462
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,620
things are so much smaller.

463
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,170
Roughly 1/100 of a bacteria.

464
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,570
And these are much less than
1/100 of this cell we're

465
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,110
talking about.

466
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,510
And they're extremely
hard to filter for.

467
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,520
To kind of keep out.

468
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,780
Because they are such,
such small particles.

469
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,290
If you think that these are
exotic things that exist for

470
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:31,360
things like HIV or Ebola , which
they do cause, or SARS,

471
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,340
you're right.

472
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,730
But they're also
common things.

473
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,490
I mean, I said at the beginning
of this video that I

474
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,300
have a cold.

475
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,040
And I have a cold because some
viruses have infected the

476
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,610
tissue in my nasal passage.

477
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,190
And they're causing me to have
a runny nose and whatnot.

478
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,540
And viruses also cause
the chicken pox.

479
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,550
They cause the herpes
simplex virus.

480
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,540
Causes cold sores.

481
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,430
So they're with us all around.

482
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,000
I can almost guarantee
you have some virus

483
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,740
with you as you speak.

484
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,630
They're all around you.

485
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,320
But it's a very

486
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,480
philosophically puzzling question.

487
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,090
Because I started with, at the
beginning, are these life?

488
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,495
And at first when I just showed
it to you, look they

489
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,740
are just this protein
with some nucleic

490
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,280
acid molecule in it.

491
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,340
And it's not doing anything.

492
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,780
And that doesn't look
like life to me.

493
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,610
It's not moving around.

494
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,660
It doesn't have a metabolism.

495
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,390
It's not eating.

496
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,560
It's not reproducing.

497
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,120
But then all of a sudden, when
you think about what it's

498
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,130
doing to cells and how it uses
cells to kind of reproduce.

499
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,700
It kind of like-- in business
terms it's asset light.

500
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,920
It doesn't need all of the
machinery because it can use

501
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,850
other people's machinery
to replicate itself.

502
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,080
You almost kind of want
to view it as a

503
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,520
smarter form of life.

504
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Because it doesn't go through
all of the trouble of what

505
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,110
every other form of life has.

506
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,570
It makes you question what life
is, or even what we are.

507
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,510
Are we these things that contain
DNA or are we just

508
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,170
transport mechanisms
for the DNA?

509
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,260
And these are kind of the
more important things.

510
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,710
And these viral infections are
just battles between different

511
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,340
forms of DNA and RNA
and whatnot.

512
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:04,330
Anyway I don't want to get
too philosophical on you.

513
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,840
But hopefully this gives you a
good idea of what viruses are

514
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,940
and why they really are, in my
mind, the most fascinating

515
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,870
pseudo organism in
all of biology.

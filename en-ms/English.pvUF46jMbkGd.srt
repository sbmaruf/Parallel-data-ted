00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome to the presentation on dividing decimals.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,620
Let's get started with a problem.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:24,505
If I were to say, how many times does point two eight go into twenty-three point eight two eight?

4
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,310
So you're going to see that these dividing decimal problems

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,480
are actually just like the level four division problems.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,730
You just have to figure out where to put the decimal.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,998
So what you do is you always want to take this decimal

8
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:39,370
and move it over as many spaces as necessary to turn this number into a whole number.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,075
So in this case, we have to move it one space, two spaces over

10
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:44,670
to put the decimal here.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,835
Well, if I did that with this number

12
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,340
I have to do it with this number as well.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,359
So I moved it over two spaces to the right,

14
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,360
so I have to move this decimal two spaces to the right-- one, two.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,042
Decimal goes here,

16
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,450
and I put the decimal right above, right there.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,560
Now I can treat this twenty-eight as a whole number.

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,835
And if I want to, let me see if I could--

19
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:07,969
well, I won't erase the old decimal

20
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:11,530
because if you were doing it with a pen you would kind of have the same problem I have.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,440
So now we do it just like a level four division problem.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,950
So we say, how many times does twenty-eight go into two?

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,260
Well, no times.

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,090
The two is smaller than twenty-eight.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,770
How many times does twenty-eight go into twenty-three?

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,144
Once again, still, it goes into it zero times,

27
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:29,800
because twenty-three is smaller than twenty-eight.

28
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:34,550
How many times does twenty-eight go into two hundred thirty-eight?

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,670
So let's think about that.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,310
Twenty-eight is almost thirty.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,160
Two hundred thirty-eight is almost two hundred forty.

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,499
So thirty goes into two hundred forty eight times,

33
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,610
because three goes into twenty-four eight times.

34
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,470
So I'm going to guess that twenty-eight goes into two hundred thirty-eight eight times.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,680
And it literally is a guess.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,360
You have to try out some numbers sometimes.

37
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,132
Eight times eight is sixty-four.

38
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,832
Eight times two is sixteen.

39
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:10,429
Plus two is twenty-two.

40
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,591
Subtract.

41
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,380
I get fourteen.

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,138
I guessed right, because the remainder when I divide twenty-eight into two hundred thirty-eight

43
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,020
and I say it goes into it eight times is fourteen,

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,470
which is less than twenty-eight.

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,602
So eight was the largest number of times

46
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:31,110
that the twenty-eight could go into two hundred and thirty-eight without being larger.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,590
So now I bring down this two.

48
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,504
Once again, you recognize this is just purely a level two division problem--

49
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,100
a level four division problem.

50
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,170
So now I say, how many times does twenty-eight go into one hundred forty-two?

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,970
Well, once again, I'm going to approximate.

52
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,350
Twenty-eight, it's almost thirty.

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,890
Let's see, thirty times four is one hundred twenty.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,062
So yeah, I'll take a guess and I'll say

55
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:54,490
let's say it goes into it four times.

56
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,770
I could be wrong, but let's see if it works out.

57
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,970
Let me get rid of this old six.

58
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,331
Four times eight is thirty-two.

59
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,960
And four times two is eight.

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,784
Plus three is eleven.

61
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,468
Two minus two is zero.

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,815
Four minus one is three.

63
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:18,580
Huh! Interesting!

64
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,205
So it turns out that my remainder here is larger than twenty-eight,

65
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:28,846
so I actually could have divided twenty-eight into one hundred forty-two one more time.

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,440
So let me go back and change that.

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,120
See, it's not a mechanical thing.

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,653
And if you feel unsure sometimes,

69
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:38,770
you just have to try numbers and see if they work.

70
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,360
And otherwise, you raise or lower the number accordingly.

71
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,400
So let me erase that four.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,469
I'm going to try not to mess up.

73
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,000
Erase all this stuff down here.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,115
I probably should have tried it out on the side first before doing all this

75
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,266
and I wouldn't have had to go back and erase it.

76
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,500
And then let me get back to what I was doing.

77
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,252
So when I went into it four times the remainder was too large,

78
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:13,331
so let me try five now.

79
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:17,569
Five times eight is forty.

80
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,880
Five times two is ten.

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,992
Plus four is fourteen.

82
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,508
One hundred forty-two minus one hundred forty is two.

83
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,940
Good!

84
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,880
Two is less than twenty-eight.

85
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,575
This five is correct.

86
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:32,900
Now I just bring down the eight.

87
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,702
Twenty-eight goes into twenty-eight exactly one time.

88
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:40,627
One times twenty-eight is twenty-eight,

89
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,325
remainder of zero. Done!

90
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:49,600
So twenty-eight goes into two thousand three hundred eighty-two point eight, eighty-five point one times.

91
00:04:49,606 --> 00:05:03,540
Or you could say, point two eight goes into twenty-three point eight two eight, eighty-five point one times.

92
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,300
That's the answer we had gotten.

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,540
And that makes sense.

94
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,925
It's always good to do a reality check,

95
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:13,475
because if I took eighty-five point one and I multiplied it by point two eight,

96
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,115
it makes sense that I'd get a number around twenty-three.

97
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,760
Point two eight is almost one third.

98
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,050
So twenty-three is almost one third of eighty-five.

99
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,810
So at least it makes sense in rough numbers.

100
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,246
When you're doing decimals,

101
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:28,383
if I had gotten eight hundred here instead of eighty-five,

102
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:30,520
I'd be like, oh, well, point two eight times eight hundred?

103
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,810
I don't know if that equals twenty-three.

104
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,675
So it's always good to just do a reality check,

105
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:39,690
and get a sense for at least the magnitude of what your answer should be.

106
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,742
Let's do another problem.

107
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:58,119
Let's do three point three goes into forty-three point two three.

108
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,480
That's a three.

109
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,330
So first thing we want to do is move the decimal.

110
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,861
We just have to move it one space here,

111
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,860
so we move it once space here as well.

112
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,300
Put the decimal right up here.

113
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,190
And now it's just a level four division problem.

114
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,470
Thirty-three goes into four zero times.

115
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,870
Thirty-three goes into forty-three one time.

116
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,810
That's easy.

117
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,670
One times thirty-three is thirty-three.

118
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,540
Do the subtraction.

119
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,390
Forty-three minus thirty-three is ten.

120
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,820
Bring down this two.

121
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,170
Thirty-three goes into one hundred two?

122
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,300
You could eyeball that one and say, about three times,

123
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,468
because three times thirty-three is ninety-nine.

124
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:41,230
Three times thirty-three is ninety-nine.

125
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,914
One hundred two minus ninety-nine?

126
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:43,414
Well, that's easy.

127
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:44,740
That's three.

128
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,892
We just bring down this three.

129
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:52,490
Thirty-three goes into thirty-three one time.

130
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,982
One times thirty-three is thirty-three.

131
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,529
Minus thirty-three, zero.

132
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:06,000
So three point three goes into forty-three point two three, thirteen point one times.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,962
Or, if you move the decimal over,

134
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,722
and when you move the decimal over to the right one spot,

135
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:16,930
all you're doing is you're multiplying both the divisor and the dividend by ten.

136
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,164
Which is fine as long as you multiply both of them by ten.

137
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:27,820
It's also like saying thirty-three goes into four hundred thirty-two point three, thirteen point one times.

138
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Let's do one more problem.

139
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,380
I think I have time.

140
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,280
YouTube puts a limit on this stuff.

141
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:44,300
So let's say two point five goes into point three three five zero how many times?

142
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,860
Well once again, let's move the decimal point over one here.

143
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,770
So we move the decimal point over one here.

144
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,650
Put the decimal here.

145
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,130
So how many times does twenty-five go into three?

146
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,560
Well zero.

147
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,780
So you could put a zero here just for fun if you want.

148
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,470
How many times does twenty-five go into thirty-three?

149
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,980
Well, it goes into it one time.

150
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,940
One times twenty-five is twenty-five.

151
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,110
Thirty-three minus twenty-five is eight.

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,490
Bring down the five.

153
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,038
Twenty-five goes into eighty-five?

154
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,430
Well, we know twenty-five times three is seventy-five.

155
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,910
So it'll go into it three times.

156
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,067
Three times twenty-five,

157
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,100
we know that's seventy-five.

158
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,192
Eighty-five minus seventy-five is ten.

159
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:27,920
Bring down the zero.

160
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,205
Up here we had brought down the five before.

161
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:33,367
And twenty-five goes into one hundred, four times.

162
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:42,910
So our answer is two point five goes into point three three five zero, point one three four times.

163
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,765
So as you see,

164
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,710
the only different step between what we're doing when we're dividing decimals,

165
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,195
and when we're doing level four division,

166
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:54,153
is we just have to make sure we get the decimal in the right place.

167
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:58,118
You shift the decimal here enough so that this becomes a whole number

168
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:01,896
and you just have to shift the decimal here the same number of times.

169
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,815
And once you do that

170
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:05,950
it just becomes a level four division problem.

171
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,172
And the whole trick with level four division

172
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,330
is always be willing to try numbers, and if the numbers don't work,

173
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,230
adjust them accordingly.

174
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,373
Don't feel that there should be a way that you can just always power through these problems.

175
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,751
You have to do a little bit of trial and error

176
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:21,070
and maybe use your eraser or do some work on side every now and then.

177
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,961
But anyway, I think you're ready to do some dividing decimals problems.

178
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,138
I hope you have some fun!

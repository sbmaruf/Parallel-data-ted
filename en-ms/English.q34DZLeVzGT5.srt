1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:05,043
Write 2.75 as a simplified
fraction.

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,450
So once you get some
practice here.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,230
You're going to find it pretty
straightforward to do.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,990
But we're really going to think
through it and get the

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,740
intuition for why this
makes sense.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,100
So if we were to write this
down, the 2, that literally

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,140
just represents two 1's, I'll
just write it down like that.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,910
Then we have the 7. Let me do that in another color.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,020
We have a 7 one place to the
right of the decimal.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,420
It's in the tenths place,
with a T-H-S at the end.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,460
So it literally represents
7 over 10.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,110
And then finally, we have the 5
in the hundredths place, so

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,990
it represents 5 over 100.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,270
Now, if I want to write this as
a simplified fraction, or

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,409
or really as a mixed number, I have
to merge these fraction parts right here.

16
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:58,320
And to add two fractions, you
have to have a common denominator.

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,267
And to figure out the common
denominator, you just have to think about

18
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:03,920
the least common
multiple of 10 and 100.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,069
And that's 100.

20
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,890
100 is divisible by
both 100 and 10.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,400
So let's get this
10 to be a 100.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,720
So we can do that by multiplying
it by 10.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,920
So when you multiply something
by 10, you add a zero

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,790
at the end of it.

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,620
But you can't just do that
to the denominator.

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,320
We also have to do that
to the numerator.

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,120
So we multiplied the
denominator by 10.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,310
Let's also multiply the
numerator by 10.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,420
7 times 10 is 70,
or 70 over 100.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,470
It's the exact same
thing as 7/10.

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,870
Now we can add these two.

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,210
What is 70 plus 5?

33
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,240
70 plus 5 is 75.

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,100
And our denominator is
100, so this can be

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,310
rewritten as 2 and 75/100.

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,800
And we saw that in the last
video, you would read this as

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,580
two and seventy-five
hundredths.

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,790
Now, we aren't in a completely
simplified fraction yet

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,670
because 75 and 100 have
common factors.

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,220
And the largest number that
goes into both, if you're

41
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,990
familiar with quarters, is 25.

42
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,320
Three quarters is $0.75, four
quarters is 100 cents, or four

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,190
quarters is $1.00.

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,110
So you divide both
of them by 25.

45
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:21,150
So 75 divided by 25 is 3, and
100 divided by 25 is 4.

46
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,540
So as a simplified mixed
number, this

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,330
becomes 2 and 3/4.

48
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,600
And after you do a lot of
practice here, and you just

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,770
see a lot of numbers like this,
it will be almost second

50
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,120
nature for you to say, oh, 2.75
is the same thing as 2

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,507
and 75/100, is the same
thing as 2 and 3/4.

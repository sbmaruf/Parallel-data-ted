00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,790
Gengo is a human powered translation platform

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,850
that is breaking down language barriers.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:24,480
For example, if you want to send an email overseas, you can get a translation in 2 hours or less!

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,340
All of our translators are real people

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,460
so you don't get terrible machine translations.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,390
They are all pre-tested native speakers

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,390
who deliver natural, native sounding translations.

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,730
Short messages or facebook posts are completed within 10 minutes

9
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,920
and only cost a few cents.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,510
You can order large amounts of translations through our API

11
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:06,149
Site changes and updates can be automatically ordered for you.

12
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:12,359
Even if you have thousands of product descriptions

13
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,329
Our worldwide network of over 5,000 native translators

14
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:23,279
Can quickly handle any amount of work.

15
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:27,009
The Internet has brought the world together but

16
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:30,990
there are still language barriers.

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,590
We combine crowdsourced translations and our API

18
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:49,169
to take that language barrier and bring it down.

19
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:55,369
At Gengo we have talented employees from all around the world.

20
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:00,859
Our small office might not fit everyone completely, but

21
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:04,759
we have amazing UX and visual designers who

22
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,709
can quickly show the world anything you create.

23
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,300
Our investors also support what we do and

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,000
Gengo is a great environment for doing high-impact work with talented staff

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,450
I expect great things from Gengo!

26
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,500
Gengo works with node.js, Postgres, and Python

27
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,360
and we're looking for talented web engineers who want to create new and exciting features.

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,840
If you're interested

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,550
join our international team

30
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:47,590
and let's break down the language barrier together!

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,600
I gave up learning Japanese myself

32
00:02:49,600 --> 99:59:59,999
But I can survive in Japan thanks to Gengo

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630


2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,830
Find the perimeter
of this hexagon.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,660
So the perimeter just means
the distance around the

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,860
object, or if you add up all of
the lengths of the sides of

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,970
the object, so we're going to
add up all of the lengths of

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,530
sides of this hexagon, and a
hexagon is just a six-sided

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,800
geometrical shape like this.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,180
So to find the perimeter, we
just need to find the distance

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,650
around the hexagon, which is
going to be the sum of all of

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,930
the lengths of the sides.

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,800
So the perimeter is going to be
24-- so how many of these

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,950
do we have?

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,670
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six 24's, which makes

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,170
sense, because a hexagon
has six sides.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,400
So we're going to have-- let
me write this a little bit

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:51,320
bigger-- 24 plus 24 plus 24 plus
24 plus 24-- and that's

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,300
five 24's-- plus 24.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,450
So let's add them all
at the same time.

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,820
We could've done it piece by
piece, but let's just go

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,490
straight ahead.

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,680
So let's go first to
the ones place.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:12,360
So 4 plus 4 is 8, 8 plus 4 is
12, 12 plus 4 is 16, 16 plus 4

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,060
is 20, 20 plus 4 is 24.

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,050
And now we're in
the tens place.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:30,830
2 plus 2 is 4 plus 2 is 6 plus
2 is 8 plus 2 is 10 plus 2 is

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,480
12 plus 2 is 14.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,650
So the sum of these
six 24's is 144.

28
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,310
That is the perimeter.

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,130
And when we learn
multiplication, if you haven't

30
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,020
learned it already, you could've
down this simpler.

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,380
You just say you have six 24's,
so this would actually

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,850
be a multiplication problem
of 6 times 24.

33
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,340
If you don't know how
to do that just yet,

34
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,390
don't worry about it.

35
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,690
You can just add them all up.

36
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,200
You get 144.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,199

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] The correct answer is intelligent agent.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's talk about intelligent agents.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here is my intelligent agent,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and it gets to interact with an environment.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The agent can perceive the state of the environment

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
through its sensors,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it can affect its state through its actuators.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The big question of artificial intelligence is the function that maps sensors to actuators.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That is called the control policy for the agent.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So all of this class will deal with how does an agent make decisions

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that it can carry out with its actuators based on past sensor data.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Those decisions take place many, many times,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and the loop of environment feedback to sensors, agent decision,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
actuator interaction with the environment and so on is called perception action cycle.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So here is my very first quiz for you.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Artificial intelligence, AI, has successfully been used in finance,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
robotics, games, medicine, and the Web.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Check any or all of those that apply.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if none of them applies, check the box down here that says none of them.

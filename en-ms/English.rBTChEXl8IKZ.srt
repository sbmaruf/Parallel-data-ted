Episode 2

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,005
Y-You...you!

4
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,633
Why did you come out of that house?

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:19,067
Because it's my house.

6
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:22,848
- You said it's your... - <i>Baek Seung Jo, why aren't you coming in?

7
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:32,733
<i>Ha Ni, come in quickly.

8
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,002
Should I carry that?

9
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:55,004
Ah, I remember now. Even if you're homeless, you don't want my help.

10
00:00:55,004 --> 00:01:02,022
Oh Seung Jo, come here.

11
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:07,067
- Hello.- He's our eldest.

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:13,667
I've heard so much already. I feel like we've been together for so long.

13
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:17,867
After watching the news, she's the one who wanted to look for you guys.

14
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,367
So we could live together.

15
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:23,433
That's why we called the broadcasting studio immediately.

16
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,007
Oh, really?

17
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,633
Thank you.

18
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:31,367
He would always tell me that he was indebted to you and that he had to pay you back some day.

19
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,367
Oh, there's no need to...

20
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:40,833
But, what took you so long?

21
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:45,433
Don't you two know each other? Both of you are in the same year.

22
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:48,978
Ah well, he's already pretty well known.

23
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,001
I guess. He is pretty good at studying.

24
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:56,533
But, the others don't like him, do they?

25
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,333
What?

26
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:05,002
His personality is a little weird. Always arrogant and looking down. Look at him now.

27
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:10,099
He doesn't have any girls, does he?

28
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,233
Well...

29
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,267
Oh.

30
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,001
Baek Eun Jo, you haven't slept yet?

31
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,004
I was studying.

32
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:22,067
Why? Then you might become like your brother.

33
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:23,003
Say hello.

34
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:26,567
He's our second child. A bit young, isn't he?

35
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,667
He's in fourth grade.

36
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,233
Hello, I am Baek Eun Jo.

37
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:36,033
He's quite good looking. He must've got it from his mother.

38
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,633
You must be so lucky.

39
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,433
Really?

40
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,233
Say hello to noona, too.

41
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,633
Ha Ni Noona. Oh Ha Ni.

42
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,467
Hi.

43
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,084
You're not greeting her?

44
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,902
I don't want to.

45
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:51,969
Why?

46
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:57,969
She looks dumb.

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,035
I'm sorry. He must be going through puberty.

48
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:01,935
No, it's okay.

49
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,802
Why would she be dumb? She's very good at studying.

50
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,435
Really?

51
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,802
Then...

52
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:12,069
What does that mean?

53
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,835
It's Chinese.

54
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:24,669
I see you're studying Chinese characters. Let's see.

55
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,835
This is for sixth grade.

56
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,502
Oh.

57
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,302
"Han Woo Choong Dong." You don't know what it means?

58
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:39,102
That's right. "Han Woo Choong Dong."

59
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,969
The meaning of this...

60
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,197
<I>What?

61
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,102
<i>What?

62
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:54,169
So,

63
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:59,002
"Han Woo" (Korean beef). You know how Korean beef is tasty, but is really expensive?

64
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:04,515
So, you have no money... you have no pocket money, but...

65
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:05,769
"Choong Dong." (urge)

66
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:12,835
You have an urge to eat Korean beef.So in other words, you want something beyond your means.

67
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:18,102
That's it.

68
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:19,502
Is that true?

69
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:21,602
It means you have the urge to eat Korean beef?

70
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:23,935
"Han" means sweaty. "Woo" means cow.

71
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,869
То make an ox sweat by pulling the wagon with the books, or to fill a house to the rafters with books.

72
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:35,769
In other words, it means "an immense number of books."

73
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,369
Aren't you stupid?

74
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:40,735
Baek Eun Jo, you have no manners.

75
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,169
Hurry and apologize.

76
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:53,302
I don't want to. I won't. I hate stupid people the most.

77
00:04:53,302 --> 00:05:17,102
<i>I've been rejected by both siblings.

78
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:30,435
Tada!

79
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:34,835
I decorated it according to my taste, but I don't know if you will like it.

80
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:39,002
Oh my... You did all of this for me?

81
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:41,169
Yes.

82
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,078
Why?

83
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,369
You don't like it?

84
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,835
No.

85
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:50,635
It's so pretty. It's like a princess' bedroom.

86
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:57,635
Right?

87
00:05:57,635 --> 00:06:00,269
This is also a princess' bed.

88
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:09,702
Hurry and try it out.

89
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:14,435
You know, I had so much fun decorating this room!

90
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:19,102
I really wanted to have a daughter so badly.

91
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:24,202
Decorating a room like this together and sharing pretty things.

92
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:28,835
And when she's older, to travel together.

93
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:37,193
However, I could only give birth to boys, so it's been really boring.

94
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:42,435
Let's go shopping and watch movies together. Okay?

95
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,969
Yes.

96
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,835
It's going to be so much fun!

97
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,835
Ah, also...

98
00:06:49,835 --> 00:07:01,835
Here, a gift.

99
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:06,935
Since you lost your house, you must have no shoes left. Am I right?

100
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:12,969
Try them on.

101
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,035
It's pretty...

102
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,635
I'm causing you so much trouble that I don't know what to do.

103
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,869
Eh! What trouble?

104
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:28,002
I was very happy to buy this.

105
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:30,035
Is the size a bit too big?

106
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:35,235
No, it's very comfortable. I really like it.

107
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:37,702
Thank you.

108
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:41,235
Even the words you say are pretty!

109
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:47,369
Just become my daughter.

110
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,735
Oh! You brought it?

111
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:54,002
Good. Now, you must be very tired. Have a good rest, okay?

112
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:55,614
Yes...

113
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:58,002
I'm very grateful for everything.

114
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,202
I'll see you tomorrow morning!

115
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:02,969
Yes...

116
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:05,335
Good night!Yes.

117
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:22,602
Seung Jo, good night.

118
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,702
This room was originally...

119
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:25,769
...Eun Jo's room.

120
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:26,636
Ah...

121
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:31,569
But thanks to someone here...Eun Jo's bed and desk...

122
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,535
My room is so crammed.

123
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,535
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:37,069
If you're sorry...

125
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:39,535
...won't you stop it now?

126
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,369
You've been annoying these past few days.

127
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:48,735
- I'm telling you not to make a big fuss at school. - Make a big fuss?

128
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,369
Don't worry.

129
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:56,102
If the news of us living together gets out, I'll be more affected by it than you.

130
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,377
What do you mean "living together"?

131
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:03,602
Weren't you the one who came to live in my house?

132
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:15,502
I'm going to wash up first.

133
00:09:15,502 --> 00:10:14,535
You're dead.

134
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:19,069
You made me bleed.

135
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,735
I regret it.

136
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:23,969
I didn't think of going so far.

137
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:33,235
However, I can't help it either.

138
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:42,069
Ahhh! That stupid jerk! Damn it, damn it! Really!

139
00:10:42,069 --> 00:11:05,335
I really hate smart guys like you!

140
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:18,369
Really? So embarrassing!

141
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:29,969
Ah! Why did he show up right then!

142
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:38,169
The toilet seat is warm.

143
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,402
What do I do?

144
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:49,469
To be so close we're using the same bathroom!

145
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:51,802
Did he hear me?

146
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:57,369
He's right next door.

147
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:04,502
Ah my tummy hurts!

148
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:29,802
I can't even poop because I'm scared I might make a sound.

149
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:42,087
They seem really close!

150
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,869
Aigoo, Oh Ha Ni.

151
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:53,535
You're still not back to your senses?

152
00:12:53,535 --> 00:13:13,469
He said he doesn't like you. He told you not to bother him.

153
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:29,102
Ah, yes.

154
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:35,435
<i>I can't believe it! <i>I'm having breakfast with Baek Seung Jo!

155
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:38,735
<i>So he's having toast and jam?

156
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:43,435
<i>Geniuses eat jam.

157
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:46,102
<i>This is so surreal.

158
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:56,435
<i>By any chance, could this be a dream?

159
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:04,935
<i>He won't be looking anymore, right?

160
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,258
Aigoo! You must have choked on your food.

161
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:11,269
Here, drink water.

162
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:14,135
Are you alright?

163
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:16,502
Yes, I'm fine.

164
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,002
She's dumb just like I expected.

165
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,435
- Baek Eun Jo! - Watch it!

166
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:23,302
Hey, Ha Ni, are you okay?

167
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:26,335
Hey, give me some more soup. It's so delicious!

168
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,835
It's really good.

169
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,235
Your Guksu (noodles) restaurant is doing well, isn't it? You have a lot of costumers, right?

170
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:35,602
Ah, yes... A lot of regular customers come over.

171
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:41,969
But you know, starting tomorrow you should sleep more, you go to work late anyway.

172
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,802
I'm done eating. I'll be getting up first.

173
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:49,769
Dear, how can you do that? Ha Ni has to go with you.

174
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,402
Hey! She doesn't even know her way to school.

175
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,202
Me too.

176
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:55,802
Hey! Why are you leaving already? Eat some more.

177
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,669
Hey, Ha Ni! Hurry!

178
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:04,702
Ah, yes!

179
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:05,602
I'll be going to school now!

180
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:10,669
- Bye! - Bye!

181
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:15,335
Slow down!

182
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:17,869
How could you just stop so suddenly?

183
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,735
It's just for today.

What?

185
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,802
Walking to school together. If someone sees us...

186
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:28,802
...it would end up being bothersome again.

187
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,769
I got it.

188
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,969
Don't tell anyone about it.

189
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:33,969
I won't!

190

00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:54,037
Have a safe trip!

337
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:55,871
Thank you!

338
00:25:55,871 --> 00:26:24,237
Take care.

339
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:27,004
Why didn't you guys come back together?

340
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:27,822
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

341
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:30,171
She's not very familar with the place yet.

342
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,604
Recently, there's been strange people around this neighborhood.

343
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:35,271
Oh Ha Ni is the strangest person here.

344
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:36,904
You come over here!

345
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,404
Hm! Come over here, you need a spanking!

346
00:26:39,404 --> 00:27:07,837
Hey! Baek Eun Jo.

347
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:29,171
Man, what a bother!

348
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:31,114
That cheapskate...

349
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,371
He left even though I told him to wait for me.

350
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:38,499
I even took a taxi.

351
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:41,504
Man, I should've just asked the taxi driver to drive me all the way home.

352
00:27:41,504 --> 00:28:16,437
Made me spend all my allowance.

353
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:19,157
Don't do it!

354
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:24,056
Don't do it!

355
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:26,333
If you open it, I won't look!

356
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,007
I'm going to close my eyes.

357
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,437
Then it wouldn't matter.

358
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:30,904
Aye...

359
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:37,145
Pervert! Pervert! Stop it! Stop it!

360
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,656
No, you can't!

361
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:46,904
That was a present.

362
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:47,804
Mister!

363
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:49,707
Hurry up and give it to me!

364
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:52,337
I said that was a present!

365
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:56,304
It's not like you're going to wear it!

366
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:58,621
Just have a look!

367
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:02,235
Then I'll give it back to you!

368
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:02,885
Man, I'm really tired.

369
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:07,501
I don't want to!!!

370
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,471
How far are you going to go?

371
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:10,867
Just once!

372
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:14,604
I beg you, please.

373
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:18,704
Without closing your eyes! It's only going to take a second!

374
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:19,604
Really it's just once, right?

375
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:22,004
Really just once.

376
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,272
Then you'll give me my shoe back?

377
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:26,171
Of course, I'll return it. How would I use this?

378
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:27,804
Fine.

379
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:30,237
Fine?...

380
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:33,504
You said you're fine with it?

381
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:36,137
Since you asked nicely...

382
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,704
...but you MUST return the shoe to me.

383
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:48,171
Of course, very well. I'm a person who keeps his promises.

384
00:29:48,171 --> 00:29:49,461
You...

385
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:51,237
...you can't close your eyes

386
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:52,937
because then that's cheating.

387
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:54,471
Okay.

388
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:56,071
I'm a person who keeps her promises too.

389
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:59,271
Alright.

390
00:29:59,271 --> 00:30:01,171
Wait a second!

391
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:02,872
What?

392
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:05,537
Let me prepare myself.

393
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,137
Fine. Then prepare yourself.

394
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:19,604
Go ahead.

395
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:22,104
Preparing for that long isn't good.

396
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:24,237
Let's do it!

397
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:27,871
1...

398
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:31,471
2...

399
00:30:31,471 --> 00:31:00,939
3...

400
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,725
Sir, forgive me! Just this once?

401
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:04,168
Please forgive me, just this once?

402
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:06,038
I just started doing this.

403
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,994
I've registered on a forum and it's only my second time on the field.

404
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:13,011
Please don't report me, I have a family...

405
00:31:13,011 --> 00:31:14,794
...and I have a kid.

406
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:20,213
Just this once, if you forgive me I swear it will never happen again. Sir, eh?

407
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:25,361
Then go straight home right now.

408
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:29,919
Thank you, sir!

409
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,591
What the?

410
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:38,596
What?

411
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,956
You shouldn't take this with you.

412
00:31:39,956 --> 00:31:41,782
You're right.

413
00:31:41,782 --> 00:32:14,966
Goodbye.

414
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,052
Were you looking for me?

415
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:17,984
Because you were worried?

416
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:20,422
As if!

417
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:23,045
I bought this.

418
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:25,461
But how did you come right on time?

419
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:28,326
It was because of my bad luck.

420
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,009
Anyway, you...

421
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:31,716
In a situation like that, people would give up the shoe. How could...

422
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,606
Because they were a present from your mom.

423
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:35,617
Today was the first time I wore them!

424
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:42,023
Yeah, but still...

425
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:44,451
What did you buy?

426
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,667
Ah! It looks good.

427
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,192
Can I have some?

428
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:57,033
My throat is parched from the run.

429
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,601
It's melted.

430
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:03,133
Is it cause of the heat?

431
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:09,033
Hey! Is that the Big Dipper? One, two...

432
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:11,011
Hey, can you hear those crickets crying?

433
00:33:11,011 --> 00:34:01,002
They're not crying.

434
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:02,009
Stupid girls...

435
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:05,433
...even if they have good taste,

436
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:12,067
I hate them.

437
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,867
Come to your senses, Oh Ha Ni.

438
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:20,008
Don't you have any pride?

439
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:22,133
Right.

440
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:23,767
Let's study!

441
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:30,001
Let's study and show them how it's done.

442
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:38,219
Math. Let's start with math.

443
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,767
Okay...

444
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:53,333
It's the global age, so let's start with English.

445
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,632
Aigoo!

446
00:34:55,632 --> 00:35:10,767
Let's start with our native language (Korean).

447
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,007
Ugh! What is this talking about?

448
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:14,867
I don't get it!

449
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:21,367
I don't know!

450
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,008
I've learned all of this?

451
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:28,000
There's no way...

452
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,004
Yes?

453
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:38,433
Here. Have this to eat.

454
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:39,833
Thank you!

455
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:45,001
Come on in.

456
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,008
You're studying hard.

457
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:51,433
Hehe. I'm just sitting around.

458
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:57,433
Make sure you take breaks in between.

459
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:00,002
I've always wanted to do something like this.

460
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:04,367
Making late night snacks and saying that you should take breaks while studying.

461
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,967
Now I feel like the mother of a high school senior.

462
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,467
Seung Jo doesn't eat late night snacks?

463
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,933
It's not that, but rather

464
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:13,967
Seung Jo doesn't study at all.

465
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,001
He doesn't study?

466
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:18,006
He's already sleeping.

467
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:20,009
But he always gets perfect scores.

468
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:23,167
He must be a real genius.

469
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:28,009
Is that so?

470
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:31,433
What's the use of getting perfect scores?

471
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:37,533
He's no fun at all.

472
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:38,633
Do you have a blog?

473
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:44,003
Of course! I'm a power blogger.

474
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,007
Ehh! You have 160 comments!

475
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:49,333
Oh! It's Eun Jo!

476
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,933
Eun Jo is lacking in manners, isn't he?

477
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:56,033
He likes his older brother so much that he takes after him.

478
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,367
Still, he's cute.

479
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:01,367
He looks a lot like Seung Jo.

480
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:03,633
I think you probably looked pretty when you were a child as well.

481
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:07,267
Don't you have an album? Aw, come on, let's see.

482
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,333
I don't have a lot of pictures.

483
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,000
Aww, how pretty!

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,333
Aww!

485
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,009
Your mom?

486
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:24,002
Oh, she's gorgeous.

487
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:25,833
That's why you're pretty.

488
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,004
To tell you the truth, I don't really remember her.

489
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:31,567
They say she passed away when I was four years old.

490
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:39,433
That's why I look at this sometimes, so I don't forget her.

491
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:43,233
There's a comment on every picture.

492
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:45,006
Hey, this is interesting.

493
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:48,933
"Summer. Maybe because we didn't have an air conditioner, it was even cooler."

494
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,004
Hey, you are so witty. Did you write this?

495
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:54,000
- Yes.- Aww!

496
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,767
"Bbomi is really light."

497
00:37:56,767 --> 00:38:00,001
"Even something light becomes heavy after holding it for a while."

498
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:16,733
"Everything in life seems to be the same way."

499
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:20,767
Aww, you're cute.

500
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,767
Seung Jo was also cute, right? When he was little?

501
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,867
Yeah, well...

502
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,008
Ah! Ha Ni!

503
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:29,167
Would you like me to show you something fun?

504
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:36,033
Aww! She's so cute, she's so pretty!

505
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:39,005
Who is this?

506
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:41,633
She looks a lot like Seung Jo.

507
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,333
Really?

508
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,967
Yes.

509
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,967
Like this here... it's exactly the same.

510
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,033
It's Seung Jo.

511
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,005
What!?

512
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:55,367
This is Seung Jo.

513
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,009
Wait a minute.

514
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:59,333
Where was it?

515
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:03,233
Hold on.

516
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:08,008
Look here.

517
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:11,267
When I was pregnant with Seung Jo,

518
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,001
he was very calm inside my belly.

519
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:18,867
He only wanted to eat watermelon, strawberries, and grapes.

520
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:21,233
So I really thought it was a girl.

521
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,733
That's why the shoes, clothes, and toys that I bought were all for a girl.

522
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,008
But it was a boy.

523
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:29,233
So what to do? Do I throw it all away?

524
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,767
That's true, but...

525
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,008
And didn't I tell you...

526
00:39:33,008 --> 00:39:37,667
...that I really wanted a girl?

527
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:42,767
That's why I raised him as a girl for just a little while.

528
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,001
But...

529
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:48,333
We went to the swimming pool and he was exposed.

530
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,002
He must have have been scarred at that time.

531
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:55,005
That's why I wonder if he's become so cold as a result of that.

532
00:39:55,005 --> 00:40:01,967
Seung Jo thinks I burnt all of this.

533
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:05,733
But what can I do, when I have the photo negatives right here?

534
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:31,733
When you look at it this way, he's not even a genius.

535
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,133
Hey!

536
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,367
What is this? Why do you keep laughing? (ooseo = laugh)

537
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,533
Me?!

538
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:38,733
I'm scary? (mooseo)

539
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:40,267
Yeah! Scary.

540
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:43,767
Really? I wonder why?

541
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,433
It's not a reaction from constipation?

542
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,567
Oh! Baek Seung Jo?

543
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:51,008
- What's he doing here?

544
00:40:51,008 --> 00:41:27,167
Who are you looking for?

545
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,007
Oh Ha Ni, get your P.E. uniform and come with me.

546
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:32,667
P.E. uniform?!

547
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:37,067
Why?

548
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:49,467
Okay.

549
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:56,667
Hey! What's going on? Why was Baek Seung Jo looking for you?

550
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:28,767
P.E. uniform?

551
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:30,002
It looks like they're exchanging something.

552
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:32,367
Isn't it the P.E. uniform?

553
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:36,009
Ahhh, this is really annoying!

554
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:39,267
Why? You could have just worn it.

555
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,633
What?!

556
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:54,033
So what if you wear girls' clothing? You're already familiar with it.

557
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:58,933
Hey! Where did you find this?! Give it to me!

558
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:01,433
What are they doing?

559
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:03,009
What is this?!

560
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:05,009
Oh Ha Ni.

561
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:11,006
What going on?! What are they doing?!

562
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:15,667
What's going on? Ha?

563
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,533
Oh! Seriously, that jerk!

564
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:21,002
Aah! Let go! Ha Ni!

565
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:24,003
Hey! Aren't you gonna give it to me?!

566
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:25,433
Hey!

567
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:31,933
Hey!

568
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:34,867
Wait a second, I'll give it to you.

569
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:36,167
I have a condition.

570
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:38,433
Condition?

571
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:41,009
What condition?

572
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:43,633
Help me with my studies.

573
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:44,233
What?

574
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:47,000
Help me raise my grades on the next exam.

575
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,267
You're saying this knowing there's only one week until the exam?

576
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:51,733
Of course I know.

577
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:53,367
Please help me.

578
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,767
Please help me get into the study hall.

579
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,367
Do you see me as someone who can create miracles?

580
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:02,004
I'm not a god!

581
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:06,333
I understand.

582
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,333
Guys!

583
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:17,667
Hey!

584
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:19,002
Oh Ha Ni!

585
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:22,633
You're trickier than I thought you were.

586
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:26,467
I said that if you get into the study hall, I'd carry you on my back.

587
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,133
Now you want me to help you study,

588
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,567
and give you a piggyback ride too?

589
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,533
If you help me, that becomes void.

590
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:38,367
Do you think I'm that petty?

591
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:42,007
Don't worry! I don't have any feelings for you anymore.

592
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:48,967
Not even this little.

593
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:56,001
Really?

594
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,967
Hey!

595
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:01,267
Heeeeey!

596
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:25,113
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viki.com

597
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:28,076
Ahh. This is so good.

598
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:30,021
Thanks to you, we ate so well.

599
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:34,343
I just brought over what was left at the restaurant.

600
00:45:34,343 --> 00:45:38,248
But this! This! It's really delicious!

601
00:45:38,248 --> 00:45:38,777
Kkotjeon? (griddle cake of gluttinous rice shaped like a flower)

602
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,066
Hapkkotjeon.

603
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:41,877
The scent of the clam is very nice.

604
00:45:41,877 --> 00:45:46,031
Ahh, yes. Thank you.

605
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:47,843
Ha Ni, what would you like for your late night snack?

606
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:49,041
Eh?

607
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,477
Ha Ni.

608
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:53,443
Are you going to study?

609
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:56,031
Starting today, please prepare for two.

610
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:58,147
Oh, why?

611
00:45:58,147 --> 00:45:59,011
No way!

612
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:00,943
Are you going to study too?

613
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:04,686
It can't be anything too greasy or too sweet. It'll be bad for her memory.

614
00:46:04,686 --> 00:46:08,277
Wheat bread and olive oil should be enough.

615
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:10,243
And egg yolk too.

616
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:12,243
Oh. Okay.

617
00:46:12,243 --> 00:46:18,843
I'll get up first.

618
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,477
Hyung! Teach m­­---

619
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,077
You do it with me.

620
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:51,011
I'll get going.

621
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:53,109
Hey! Oh Ha Ni!

622
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:56,843
You don't even know this?

623
00:46:56,843 --> 00:47:01,074
Why don't you just give up school?

624
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:02,877
What are you doing?

625
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:04,051
Baby Baek Seung Jo!

626
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:08,343
Oh Ha Ni!

627
00:47:08,343 --> 00:47:09,061
Fine!

628
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:15,577
Then I'll start by explaining the basics completely, so listen well.

629
00:47:15,577 --> 00:47:19,051
First, use "x" as the number you want to determine.

630
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:21,543
What is "x" here?

631
00:47:21,543 --> 00:47:22,677
Huh?

632
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:24,976
What is "x" here?

633
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:31,343
Alphabet!

634
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:32,031
I don't know.

635
00:47:32,031 --> 00:47:33,001
What is it?

636
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:37,081
That's right! It's the number that we don't know. "X" is the unknown number.

637
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:41,277
What do we call an unsolved case?

638
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:42,443
X-file?

639
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,177
That's right.

640
00:47:43,177 --> 00:47:45,477
What did we call the younger generation when we were kids?

641
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:46,143
Generation X!

642
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,077
Yup.

643
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:55,577
The difficult to understand generation. The unsolved case.It was decided that "x" is used for unknown numbers.

644
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:58,943
But, why is it "x"...

645
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,043
...when there's "w" and "h"?

646
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,031
What's the use of discussing the "what ifs"?

647
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:05,843
It's already been decided.

648
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:07,061
Here,

649
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:11,477
X equals 2 to the 30th power times 10 to the negative 7th power.

650
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:21,077
log(x) = log (2^30 * 10^-7)

651
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:30,543
log(x) = 30log2 - 7log10log(x)=30*0.3-7

652
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:36,377
log(x) = 2. So, x = 100.

653
00:48:36,377 --> 00:48:43,143
But since we're supposed to write this as a binary number, what is it?

654
00:48:43,143 --> 00:48:46,643
What is 100 as a binary number?

655
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,043
Calculate it.

656
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:54,843
What does that mean?

657
00:48:54,843 --> 00:49:01,043
I feel like I'm going to explode.

658
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:02,177
Yah!

659
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:12,543
Omo!

660
00:49:12,543 --> 00:49:30,777
That Oh Ha Ni, so stupid and dumb.

661
00:49:30,777 --> 00:49:33,677
Do you know what the decimal system is?

662
00:49:33,677 --> 00:49:34,091
Yeah.

663
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:39,177
10<BR><BR>20<BR><BR>30

664
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:44,177
Then how about the binary numeral system?

665
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:47,743
It's a way to express a number using only 0 and 1.

666
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:48,877
But why?

667
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:52,077
What's the use of that?

668
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:54,041
The computer.

669
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:59,001
Computer?

670
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:05,021
In 1974, from the Arecibo Observatory, a message was sent to outer space.

671
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:10,031
If there were real aliens out there, they would receive the message and respond.

672
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:11,677
But in what language could the message be sent?

673
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:13,021
In English?

674
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:14,277
In Korean?

675
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,043
We don't know what the level of intelligence of the aliens could be,

676
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:21,081
so in order for them to decipher the message by simply knowing 0 and 1,

677
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:23,643
the message was sent in binary code.

678
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:25,643
Oh. Ohhh!

679
00:50:25,643 --> 00:50:31,011
In order to communicate with aliens, I should learn the binary system. This is a must learn. Put a star next to this.

680
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,143
Then, what is the way to change 100 to the binary numeral system?

681
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:35,977
Then,

682
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:40,001
did we receive a response from the aliens?

683
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:43,743
So far, not yet.

684
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:47,343
But then again, the universe is so huge.

685
00:50:47,343 --> 00:50:48,143
Right?

686
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:48,977
That's right!

687
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:52,277
Because the universe is so big, the log system was developed.

688
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:54,343
Really?

689
00:50:54,343 --> 00:51:02,177
Log was made to express really big things.

690
00:51:02,177 --> 00:51:03,743
Why don't you just give up?

691
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:05,041
Why?

692
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,251
It's fun.

693
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:11,091
How can there be so many things you don't know?

694
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:17,577
Do you know everything?

695
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:22,377
Who are these people?

696
00:51:22,377 --> 00:51:25,001
Si Won, Kang In, Shin Dong, Kyuhyun, Han Kyung, Ki Bum...

697
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:32,041
Sung Min, Hee Chul, Ye Sung, Eun Hyuk, Dong Hae, Lee Teuk, Ryeowook (all 13 Super Junior members)!

698
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:38,077
We just have different fields of interest.

699
00:51:38,077 --> 00:51:48,477
So, what about logarithms?

700
00:51:48,477 --> 00:51:50,982
As shown in my electroencephalogram, even when I'm sleeping, my alpha waves are moving.

701
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:57,061
I can read 7000 words per minute; I also have an excellent memory.

702
00:51:57,061 --> 00:52:01,277
When you breathe, put strength on your belly button and inhale slowly...

703
00:52:01,277 --> 00:52:07,031
...and slowly exhale. <Br>Your eyes should be focused on the dot.

704
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:08,243
Not the wall!

705
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:19,021
The dot!

706
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:20,277
Focus!

707
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:34,843
Until you can only see the dot.

708
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:35,071
Move.

709
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:37,677
You must move your body as you memorize,

710
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:39,011
in order to retain better.

711
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:51,477
"At" for objects. "With" for people.

712
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:59,477
1592 Imjin invasion.

713
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:00,343
Ha Ni!

714
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,643
1592 Imjin invasion!

715
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:05,011
Oh! What's wrong?!

716
00:53:05,011 --> 00:53:06,001
Dark circles?

717
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:07,677
Ha Ni,

718
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:10,277
tell us the truth.

719
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:10,777
What?

720
00:53:10,777 --> 00:53:15,277
How are you doing at that place you're staying at?

721
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:16,277
I'm doing well.

722
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:19,677
Do you call this doing well?

723
00:53:19,677 --> 00:53:21,563
Something's not right.

724
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:23,063
You heard it too, right?

725
00:53:23,063 --> 00:53:29,196
Last time when I said I'd walk her home, she ran away.

726
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:32,005
Ha Ni,

727
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:34,963
Ha Ni, today let's...

728
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:35,796
Where did she go?

729
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,429
She went home.

730
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:38,529
She said she needs to study.

731
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:43,629
See, see, see! What kind of studying would she do?

732
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:47,129
In my opinion...Surely...

733
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:50,296
Surely?

734
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:51,996
They're working her to death without letting her sleep.

735
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:55,129
You saw her face, right?

736
00:53:55,129 --> 00:54:09,363
I think I, Bong Joon Gu, need to intervene.

737
00:54:09,363 --> 00:54:11,083
Hyung.

738
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,173
How do I solve this?

739
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:14,829
Oh, Eun Jo.

740
00:54:14,829 --> 00:54:16,963
Hyung needs to do this.

741
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:27,151
Ask Mom.

742
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,563
Yah!<BR><BR> Oh Ha Ni!

743
00:54:29,563 --> 00:54:32,396
You stupid, idiotic moron.

744
00:54:32,396 --> 00:55:02,629
Because of you, I can't study and my brother can't sleep. Who the heck are you? Go home!

745
00:55:02,629 --> 00:55:03,863
Oh! You came?

746
00:55:03,863 --> 00:55:12,829
Oh. Just forget it.

747
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:15,063
Here.

748
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:16,929
What is this?

749
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:19,621
Read that for today and go to bed early.

750
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:21,563
Tomorrow's the exam.

751
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,796
What is this?

752
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:28,063
I came up with potential exam questions.

753
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,596
Wow!

754
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:33,229
When did you make all this?

755
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,796
I'm totally touched!

756
00:55:34,796 --> 00:55:35,796
Yah!

757
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:37,429
I told you to hurry and look through it.

758
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:40,063
Stop talking nonsense!

759
00:55:40,063 --> 00:55:42,629
I got it.

760
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:50,463
Why get mad?

761
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:57,896
It'd be nice if all the questions came out of this.

762
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:04,429
He's sleeping.

763
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:11,896
Then again, he hasn't slept much because of me.

764
00:56:11,896 --> 00:56:21,163
The Almighty Baek Seung Jo sleeps like this.

765
00:56:21,163 --> 00:56:28,763
Thank you.

766
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:39,129
Kids!

767
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:42,263
Oh my gosh!

768
00:56:42,263 --> 00:56:44,029
Jackpot!

769
00:56:44,029 --> 00:57:09,429
Let me get the camera!

770
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,629
I'm dying.

771
00:57:10,629 --> 00:57:11,329
Oh my.

772
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:23,929
It's tiring. Oh gosh.

773
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:30,563
Good luck.

774
00:57:30,563 --> 00:58:05,196
Punk! What's with the cool act?

775
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,229
Is this good?

776
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:08,163
Wait...

777
00:58:08,163 --> 00:58:27,229
A little higher.

778
00:58:27,229 --> 00:58:29,696
- Baek Seung Jo got a perfect score again.

779
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:33,041
<i> Wow, he got a perfect score again.

780
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:37,031
<i>When he couldn't even sleep much lately because of me.

781
00:58:37,031 --> 00:59:19,021
<i>What a relief!

782
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:22,001
You got a perfect score again! You're amazing!

783
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:22,877
Congrats!

784
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:26,943
Of course, I studied for the first time in my life.

785
00:59:26,943 --> 00:59:30,877
How could I <i>not</i> get a perfect score?

786
00:59:30,877 --> 00:59:32,677
You too.

787
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:33,439
Huh?

788
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:34,643
You didn't see it yet?

789
00:59:34,643 --> 00:59:36,117
Me?

790
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:54,061
Me?

791
00:59:54,061 --> 01:00:03,343
[50th - Oh Ha Ni]

792
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:18,277
Oh Ha Ni.

793
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:20,143
You saw?

794
01:00:20,143 --> 01:00:30,031
I did it!

795
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:33,061
Thank you! Thank you so, so much!It's all thanks to you!

796
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,577
Most of the exam questions were what you predicted!

797
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:37,843
What are you doing?

798
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:42,143
That thing.

799
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:45,243
Ahh.

800
01:00:45,243 --> 01:00:47,177
This?

801
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:51,443
Don't just take it out any place!

802
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,643
Seung Jo!

803
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:54,051
Thank you!

804
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:57,001
Really! Thank you so much!

805
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:05,021
Stop!

806
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:07,977
Yes.

807
01:01:07,977 --> 01:01:08,071
Me?

808
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:11,001
Yes, you.<BR>Baek Seung Jo.

809
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,343
How can you leave just like that when there are so many witnesses?

810
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,832
Huh?

811
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:24,577
You promised to give her a piggyback ride around the school if our Ha Ni got into the Special Study Hall.

812
01:01:24,577 --> 01:01:26,377
No, teacher. We decided to void that.

813
01:01:26,377 --> 01:01:29,437
What are you talking about?This kind of miracle may never happen again!

814
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:33,043
But...that....

815
01:01:33,043 --> 01:01:34,277
No, we can't!

816
01:01:34,277 --> 01:01:37,051
When you said you were going to study hard, I just dismissed it.

817
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:42,343
As a teacher, I couldn't even help you.

818
01:01:42,343 --> 01:01:49,001
I'm so proud of you, Ha Ni! You saved my pride!

819
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:50,091
But...

820
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:55,277
What the heck are you... Did you lie?

821
01:01:55,277 --> 01:01:59,677
No, teacher. No.

822
01:01:59,677 --> 01:02:05,777
Carry her!

823
01:02:05,777 --> 01:02:07,443
Carry her!

824
01:02:07,443 --> 01:02:36,045
Carry her!

I don't like him.

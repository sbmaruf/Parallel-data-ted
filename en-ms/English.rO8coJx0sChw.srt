1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,360
Arguably, one of the most important molecules in all of

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,150
biology is ATP.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,235
ATP, which stands for adenosine triphosphate.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,340
Which sounds very fancy.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,270
But all you need to remember, or any time you see ATP

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,180
hanging around in some type of biochemical reaction,

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,940
something in your brain should say, hey, we're dealing with

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,360
biological energy.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,690
Or another way to think of ATP is the currency-- I'll put

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,645
that in quotes-- of biological energy.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,000
So how is it a currency of energy?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,820
Well ATP stores energy in its bonds.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,040
And I'll explain what that
means in a second.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,220
And before we learn what an adenosine group or a

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,870
3-phosphate group looks like, you can just take a bit of a

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,010
leap of faith, that you could imagine ATP as being made up

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,160
of something called-- let me do it in a nice color-- an

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,950
adenosine group right there.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,020
And then attached to it you'll have three phosphates.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,320
Not might, you will.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,150
You'll have three phosphates attached to it just like that.

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,970
And this is ATP.

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,450
Adenosine triphosphate.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,850
Tri- meaning three phosphate groups.

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,235
Now if you take adenosine triphosphate and you hydrolyze

26
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,460
this bond, which means if you take this in

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,610
the presence of water.

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,250
So let me just throw some water in here.

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,610
Let's say I have H2O.

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,450
Then one of these phosphate groups will break off.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,100
Essentially part of this water joins to this phosphate group,

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,900
and then part of it joins to this

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
phosphate group right there.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,590
And I'll show you that in a little bit more detail.

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,960
But I want to give you the big picture first.

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,430
What you're left with is an adenosine group that now has

37
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,680
two phosphates on it.

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,520
And this is called adenosine diphosphate or ADP.

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,860
Before we had triphosphate, which means three phosphates.

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,330
Now we have diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, so

41
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,650
instead of a tri here we just write a di.

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,590
Which means you have two phosphate groups.

43
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,760
And so the ATP has been hydrolyzed, or you have broken

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,790
off one of these phosphate groups.

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,550
And so now you're left with ADP and then an extra

46
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,550
phosphate group right here.

47
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,370
And-- and this is the whole key to everything that we talk

48
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,660
about when we're dealing with ATP-- and

49
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,910
you have some energy.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,590
And so when I talk about ATP being the currency of

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,500
biological energy, this is why.

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,220
Is that if you have ATP, and if you were to-- through some

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,960
chemical reaction-- you pop off this phosphate right here.

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,470
It's going to generate energy.

55
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,960
That energy can be used for just general heat.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,810
Or you could couple this reaction with other reactions

57
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,830
that require energy.

58
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,960
And then those reactions will be able to move forward.

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,490
So, I draw these circles.

60
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,040
Adenosine and phosphates.

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,010
And really, this is all you need to know.

62
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,780
Already, what I've shown you
right here is really all you

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,660
need to know to operationally think of how ATP operates in

64
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,390
most biological systems. And if you want to

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,740
go the other way.

66
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,020
If you have energy and you want to generate ATP, the

67
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,050
reaction will just go this way.

68
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,430
Energy plus a phosphate group plus some ADP, you

69
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,610
can go back to ATP.

70
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,940
And so this is stored energy.

71
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,520
So this side of the equation is stored energy.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,220
And this side of the equation is used energy.

73
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,810
And this is really all you--well this is 95% of what you

74
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,430
need to know to really understand the function of ATP

75
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,450
in biological systems. It's just a store of energy when

76
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,150
you-- ATP has energy.

77
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,070
When you break a phosphate off, it generates energy.

78
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,700
And then if you want to go from ADP and a phosphate back

79
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,580
to ATP, you have to use
energy up again.

80
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,040
So if you have ATP, that's a source of energy.

81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,580
If you have ADP and you want ATP, you need to use energy.

82
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,500
And so far I've just drawn a circle with an A around it and

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,460
said that's an adenosine.

84
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,840
But sometimes I think it's satisfying to see what the

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,180
molecule actually looks like.

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,010
So I cut and pasted this from Wikipedia.

87
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,310
And the reason why I didn't show this to you initially is

88
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,829
because this looks very complicated.

89
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,780
While the conceptual reason why ATP is the currency of

90
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,710
energy, I think is fairly straightforward.

91
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,200
When it has three phosphates, one phosphate can break off.

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,310
And then that'll result with some energy being

93
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,640
put into the system.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
Or if you want to attach that phosphate you

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
have to use up energy.

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,910
That's just the basic principle of ATP.

97
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,010
But this is its actual structure.

98
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,220
But even here we can break it down and see that it's really

99
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,740
not too bad.

100
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,790
We said adenosine.

101
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,490
Let me draw the adenosine group.

102
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,660
We have adenosine.

103
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,220
This right here is adenosine.

104
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,070
This part of the molecule
right there.

105
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,470
That is adenosine.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,340
And for those of you that have really paid attention to some

107
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,560
of the other videos, you might
recognize that this part of

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,660
adenosine-- so this is called adenosine, but this part right

109
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,820
here-- is adenine.

110
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,110
Which is the same adenine that makes up the nucleotides that

111
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,460
are the backbone of DNA.

112
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,870
So some of these molecules in biological systems have more

113
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,580
than one use.

114
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,910
This is the same adenine where we talk

115
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,170
about adenine and guanine.

116
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,100
This is a purine.

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,370
And there's also the
pyrimidines, but I won't go

118
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:33,920
into that much.

119
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,180
But that's the same molecule.

120
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,380
So that's just an interesting thing.

121
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,950
The same thing that makes up DNA
is also part of what makes

122
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,940
up these energy currency molecules.

123
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,700
So the adenine makes part of the adenosine part of ATP.

124
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,210
And then the other part
right here is ribose.

125
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,970
Which you might also recognize from RNA, ribonucleic acid.

126
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,040
That's because you have ribose dealing

127
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,150
in the whole situation.

128
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,190
But I won't go into that much.

129
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,970
But ribose is just a 5-carbon sugar.

130
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,340
When they don't draw the molecule, it's implied that

131
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,950
it's a carbon.

132
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,160
So this is one carbon right there, two carbons, three

133
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,650
carbons, four carbons, five carbons.

134
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,720
And that's just nice to know.

135
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,840
It's nice to know that they share parts of their

136
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,700
molecules with DNA.

137
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,380
And these are familiar building blocks that we see

138
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,260
over and over again.

139
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,920
But I want to emphasize that knowing this, or memorizing

140
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,270
this, in no way will help you understand the simpler

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,360
understanding of ATP just being what

142
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
drives biological reactions.

143
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,520
And then here I drew 3-phosphate groups, and this

144
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,350
is their actual molecular structure.

145
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,490
Their Lewis structures right here.

146
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,170
That's one phosphate group.

147
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,530
This is the second phosphate group.

148
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,320
And this is a third phosphate group.

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,970
Just like that.

150
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,830
When I first learned this, my first question was, OK I can

151
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,080
take this as a leap of faith that if you take one of these

152
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,590
phosphate groups off or if this bond is hydrolyzed, that

153
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,020
somehow that releases energy.

154
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,880
And then I kind of went on and answered all the questions

155
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,570
that I had to answer.

156
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,950
But why does it release energy?

157
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,920
What is it about this bond that releases energy?

158
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,690
Remember all bonds are are electrons being shared with

159
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,830
different atoms.

160
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,190
So the best way you could think about it is right here.

161
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,900
These electrons that are being shared right across this bond,

162
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,620
or this electron that's being shared right across this bond,

163
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,470
and it's coming from the phosphate.

164
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,680
I won't draw the Periodic Table right now.

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,490
But you know the phosphate has five electrons to share.

166
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,370
It's less electronegative than oxygen, so oxygen will kind of

167
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,460
hog the electron.

168
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,310
But this electron is very uncomfortable.

169
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,930
There's a couple of reasons why it is uncomfortable.

170
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,700
It's in a high energy state.

171
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,250
One reason why is, you have all these

172
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,720
negative oxygens here.

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,590
So they kind of want to push away from each other.

174
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,960
So these electrons in this bond really can't kind of get

175
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,220
close to the nucleus.

176
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,670
They'll go into kind of a low energy state.

177
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,000
All of this is more of an analogy than the reality.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,210
We all know that electrons can get quite complex.

179
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,430
And there's a whole quantum mechanical world.

180
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,380
But that's a good way to think of it.

181
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,840
That these molecules want to be away from each other.

182
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,330
But you have these bonds, so this electron, it's kind of in

183
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,395
a high energy state.

184
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:17,250
It's further from the nucleuses of these two atoms

185
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,580
than it might want to be.

186
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,220
And when you pop this phosphate group off, all of a

187
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,870
sudden these electrons can enter into a

188
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,110
lower energy state.

189
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,080
And that generates energy.

190
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,030
So this energy right here is always-- in fact in any

191
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,409
chemical reaction where they say energy is generated, it's

192
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,200
always from electrons going to a lower energy state.

193
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,570
That's what it's all about.

194
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,610
And later in future videos when we do cellular

195
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,480
respiration and glycolysis and all that, whenever we show

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,330
energy, it's really from electrons going from

197
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,900
uncomfortable states to more comfortable states.

198
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,640
And in the process they generate energy.

199
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,620
If I'm in a plane or I'm jumping out of a plane, I have

200
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,180
a lot of potential energy right when I

201
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,050
jump out of the plane.

202
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,280
And you can view that as an uncomfortable state.

203
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,350
And then when I'm sitting on my couch watching football, I

204
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,690
have a lot less potential energy, so that's a very

205
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,500
comfortable state.

206
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,790
And I could have generated a lot of energy

207
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,480
falling to my couch.

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,590
But I don't knows.

209
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,540
My analogies always break down at some point.

210
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,230
Now, the last thing I want to go over for you is exactly how

211
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,530
this reaction happens.

212
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,410
So far you could turn off this video and you could already

213
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,680
deal with ATP as it is used in 95% of biology,

214
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,790
especially AP Bio.

215
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,630
But I want you to understand how this

216
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,320
reaction actually happens.

217
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,110
So to do that, what I'm going to do is copy and

218
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,150
paste parts of these.

219
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,170
So I already told you that this guy right here is going

220
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,280
to break off of the ATP.

221
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,030
So that's the phosphate group that breaks off.

222
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,360
And then you have the rest of it.

223
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,310
You have the ADP that's left over.

224
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,530
So this is the ADP.

225
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,340
I don't even have to copy and paste all of this stuff.

226
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,000
You can just accept that that's the adenosine group.

227
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,500
Just like that.

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,240
So we've already said that this thing gets hydrolyzed

229
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,930
off, or gets cut off and that generates energy.

230
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,770
But what I want to do is actually

231
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,300
show you the mechanism.

232
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,260
A little bit of hand-wavy mechanism of how

233
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,630
this actually happens.

234
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,825
So I said this reaction occurs in the presence of water.

235
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:37,210
So let me draw some water here.

236
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,040
So I have an oxygen and a hydrogen.

237
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,100
And then I have another hydrogen.

238
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,710
That's water right there.

239
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,360
So hydrolysis is just a reaction where you say, hey,

240
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,420
this guy here, he wants to bond with something or he

241
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,920
wants to share someone else's electrons.

242
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,500
So maybe this hydrogen right here goes down here and shares

243
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,250
its electron with this oxygen right here.

244
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,320
And then this phosphorus, it has an extra electron that it

245
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,820
needs to share.

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,190
Remember it has five valence electrons; it wants to share

247
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,360
them with oxygen.

248
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,040
It has one, two, three, four being shared right now.

249
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,670
Well, if this hydrogen goes to this guy, then you're left

250
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,980
with this blue OH right here.

251
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,460
And this guy can share one of the

252
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,810
phosphorus' extra electrons.

253
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,190
So you get the OH just like that.

254
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,230
So that's the actual process that happens.

255
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,350
And it could go the other way as well.

256
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,040
I could've cleaved it here.

257
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,740
I could have cleaved the whole thing here.

258
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,270
And so this guy would have kept the oxygen and the

259
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,890
hydrogen would have gone to him.

260
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,820
And then this guy would have taken the OH.

261
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,540
It could happen in either order.

262
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,765
And so either order would be fine.

263
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:47,010
And there's one other point I want to make.

264
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,435
And this is a little bit more complex.

265
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,930
And I was even wondering whether I wanted to make it.

266
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,310
My whole reason why you're kind of in a lower energy

267
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,510
state is, once you break apart--actually let me go

268
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,370
down here-- is because I said, hey, this electron is happier

269
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,090
when it's-- so let's say this electron that was part of this

270
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,760
phosphorus is happier now.

271
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,540
It's in a lower energy state because

272
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,950
it's not being stretched.

273
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,350
It's not having to spend time between that guy and that guy

274
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,050
because this molecule and this molecule want to spread apart

275
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,560
because they have negative charges.

276
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,910
That's part of the reason.

277
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,410
The other reason why, and we'll talk about this in a lot

278
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,540
more detail when we learn more about organic chemistry, is

279
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,940
that this has more resonance.

280
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,770
More resonance structures or resonance configurations.

281
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,360
And all that means is that these electrons, these extra

282
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
electrons here, they can kind of move about between the

283
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,170
different atoms. And that makes it even more stable.

284
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,910
So if you imagine that this oxygen right here has an extra

285
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,700
electron with it.

286
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,840
So that extra electron right there, it could come down here

287
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,180
and then form a double bond with the phosphorus.

288
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,810
And then this electron right here can then jump back up to

289
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,870
that oxygen.

290
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,400
And then that could happen on this side and on that side.

291
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,990
And I won't go into the details, but that's another

292
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,800
reason why it makes it more stable.

293
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,590
If you've already taken organic chemistry, you can

294
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,080
kind of appreciate that more.

295
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,570
But I don't want to get all into the weeds.

296
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,120
The most important thing to remember about ATP is that

297
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,460
when you cleave off a phosphate group it generates

298
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,950
energy that can drive all sorts of biological functions,

299
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,570
like growth and movement, muscle movement, muscle

300
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,900
contraction, electrical impulses in

301
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,290
nerves and the brain.

302
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,310
So this is the main battery or currency of energy in

303
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,540
biological systems. That's the main thing that you really

304
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,790
just need to remember about ATP.

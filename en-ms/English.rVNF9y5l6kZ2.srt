1
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:44,122
The channel's here on the chart. So are the marking lights.

2
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:47,042
Then what's wrong with them?

3
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:49,402
Those lights don't seem to be in just the right place.

4
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,922
They're both a bit out of position, according to this.

5
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:54,562
Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over.

6
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:58,362
"Safe between the world over" doesn't go in these waters.

7
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:02,802
Look here. You'll see the water shoals on the island side...

8
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:05,562
while the deep soundings run to the mainland.

9
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,482
Have any of you seen the captain today?

10
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:11,922
- No. He wasn't down for dinner. - No, and he wasn't down for lunch.

11
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:15,122
He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.

12
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:17,042
What are you driving at?

13
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:20,362
Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters...

14
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:22,482
he's had the jitters.

15
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:26,402
There's something wrong. I... Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.

16
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,882
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?

17
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,282
- Give him a shot of scotch. - Give the whole bottle.

18
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:35,682
- No! I've got nerves too. - Here you are, Doc.

19
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:38,402
Just what you need.

20
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:43,722
- Well, maybe you're right. - And how, boy.

21
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:46,162
- Good evening, Captain. - Good evening, sir.

22
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:50,962
- May I speak with you? - Why, certainly. Go ahead.

23
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,842
We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.

24
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:58,162
- Good. - But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.

25
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:01,002
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific. You know that.

26
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,162
I know, sir, but...

27
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,482
Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?

28
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:08,602
- Well, not a lot. - Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...

29
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,522
Bob's not a sailor. He's a hunter.

30
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:13,922
He's made many of these trips. He's young, but he has judgment.

31
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:16,122
I'll call him.

32
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:19,122
- Oh, Bob. Bob! - What is it?

33
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:21,162
- Come up here, will ya? - Just a minute.

34
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:23,642
What's bothering you, Captain?

35
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:27,962
There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.

36
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,682
Boy! Just take a look at these.

37
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:34,002
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter, Doc, but oh, what a photographer.

38
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,122
If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip...

39
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,042
they might have believed my book.

40
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,802
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.

41
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:46,202
Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper. What's the matter?

42
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,202
These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other...

43
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:50,122
and end up believing it all themselves.

44
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:52,202
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know...

45
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:54,762
that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.

46
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,642
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?

47
00:03:57,642 --> 00:04:03,162
I think we should turn back and take the outside course.

48
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:05,522
We'll go ahead.

49
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:12,122
Very well, sir. It's your ship.

50
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:15,322
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea. "

51
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,682
Now, wait a minute, fellas. Let's talk this over.

52
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,402
- There's no use taking any chances. - Chances? That's fine talk...

53
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,322
coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.

54
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,442
Get an eyeful of this.

55
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:27,842
And he talks about taking chances.

56
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:31,122
Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.

57
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:33,042
Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.

58
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,962
He looks more frightened than the tiger.

59
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:37,762
- He is. - What'd you have on your mind, Doc?

60
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:40,762
I'll tell you what I had on my mind.

61
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:44,122
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.

62
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:48,242
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.

63
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:51,482
The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.

64
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,562
- Hear! Hear! - It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?

65
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,682
Now, just a minute. What makes you think...

66
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:59,402
it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?

67
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:01,362
Take that fellow right there, for instance.

68
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,642
There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.

69
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:06,682
He didn't want to. He got interested in hunting me.

70
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,602
He didn't hate me for stalking him...

71
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,402
any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.

72
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,322
As a matter of fact, we admired each other.

73
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:17,002
Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?

74
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:21,642
- Well, not now. - Mm-mm!

75
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,682
Here comes that bad-luck lady again.

76
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,082
Third time tonight.

77
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:29,282
- Here. Let me shuffle them. - Wait a minute. Don't evade the issue.

78
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:32,082
- Yeah, speak up. - I asked you a question.

79
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,922
- You did? I forgot. - Oh, no, you didn't.

80
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:37,242
I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game...

81
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,162
if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.

82
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:41,082
- Come on. - What's your answer now, Bob?

83
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:43,042
That's something I'll never have to decide.

84
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,122
Listen here, you fellows.

85
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:48,602
This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.

86
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:51,282
Luckily, I'm a hunter. Nothing can ever change that.

87
00:05:51,282 --> 00:06:03,722
Hang on!

88
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:06,442
Hello! Hello, down there! Hello, Engine Room!

89
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:35,642
- The panel is flooded! - If the water hits those hot boilers...

90
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:39,642
Help!

91
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:55,922
Help!

92
00:06:55,922 --> 00:07:04,762
You trying to drown me?

93
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:06,682
Where are the others?

94
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:08,722
See anybody?

95
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:17,562
Nobody left but us two and... that fella.

96
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,842
Doc! Help!

97
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:25,122
- Look! - Shark!

98
00:07:25,122 --> 00:10:17,122
Ohh! It got me!

99
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:28,442
Hello! Is anybody here?

100
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:34,522
Anybody around, I say.

101
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:41,562
Oh, hello. Is this your house?

102
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:46,122
I'm not trying to break in, but I've been in a wreck.

103
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,682
Our yacht just sunk with all hands.

104
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:54,522
I got ashore and found your place here by accident.

105
00:10:54,522 --> 00:11:00,282
I'm not trying to intrude, but I'm in sort of a jam.

106
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:02,562
Don't you understand any English?

107
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,682
Lvan does not speak any language.

108
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:07,442
He has the misfortune to be dumb.

109
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:10,762
Oh, hello. Are you the owner here?

110
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:14,682
Yes. Welcome to my poor fortress.

111
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:17,042
- Fortress? - It once was.

112
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,962
Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.

113
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:23,642
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here.

114
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,882
I am Count Zaroff.

115
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:30,002
My name's Robert Rainsford. Glad to meet you.

116
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,282
Very glad.

117
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,562
Lvan is a Cossack.

118
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:38,002
I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.

119
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:49,962
Smile, Ivan.

120
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:54,242
I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.

121
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:58,002
But how appalling!

122
00:11:58,002 --> 00:12:00,842
And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?

123
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:05,042
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

124
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:08,082
You're certain?

125
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,362
I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been.

126
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,762
The swellest crowd on Earth... my best friends.

127
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:17,082
- It's incredible. - Such things are always incredible.

128
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:20,442
Death is for others, not for ourselves.

129
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:24,042
That is how most of my other guests have felt.

130
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,482
Your other guests? You mean this has happened before?

131
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:31,762
My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house.

132
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:35,002
It would seem that this island were cursed.

133
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:37,242
That's just what the captain said.

134
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,162
Only he thought it was uninhabited.

135
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:43,042
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.

136
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,882
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway. - My house is yours.

137
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:50,522
Oh, by the way. You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.

138
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:52,522
Yes. They look about the way I feel.

139
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,442
Yes.

140
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,602
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests...

141
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:02,202
that you can possibly get into.

142
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:04,122
Lvan will show you to your room.

143
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:08,722
- Thank you. - You'll find a stiff drink there also.

144
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,282
Thanks a lot.

145
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:41,682
All pleasure is mine.

146
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:47,322
Come in.

147
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:52,242
- Ready, Rainsford? - All set.

148
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:54,402
I'm afraid we have finished dinner.

149
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,122
But I have ordered something for you.

150
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:58,042
Thanks. I don't feel like eating, though.

151
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:01,762
Oh. Well, perhaps later.

152
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,282
Now, then, what do you say to coffee...

153
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:11,002
and most charming company?

154
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:14,162
It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know...

155
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:18,122
but our feminine guest is easily perturbed.

156
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:21,282
If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.

157
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:24,442
A- Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel.

158
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:34,082
- Why, sure. Of course. - Thank you.

159
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,722
Miss Trowbridge, may I present Mr. Robert Rainsford.

160
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:39,322
- Miss Eve Trowbridge. - How do you do?

161
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,842
- How do you do? - And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.

162
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:44,082
How are you, old chap? Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?

163
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,642
- Coming out of it now, thanks. - We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?

164
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,722
Indeed we do.

165
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,282
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.

166
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:58,002
Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.

167
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:59,922
Vodka, that's the stuff!

168
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,322
One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.

169
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:05,082
Have to toss it off, though. Like this.

170
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:07,442
Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you?

171
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,962
Don't be ridiculous, sis. We are victims of circumstance.

172
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,922
Same as Mr. Rainsford.

173
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:15,562
And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance.

174
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,482
- Isn't that so, Count? - Of course, yes.

175
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:20,362
- You were in a shipwreck too? - Yes.

176
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:22,642
Our lifeboat was the only one saved...

177
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:24,642
my brother and I and two sailors.

178
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:28,122
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.

179
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,402
Those channel lights must have been shifted.

180
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,962
- I wonder it hasn't been reported. - Well, we'll report 'em...

181
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:35,082
just as soon as we get back to the mainland.

182
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:37,562
You see, the count has only one launch...

183
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:42,442
and that's under repair.

184
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,522
Russians are not the best mechanics.

185
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:49,842
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.

186
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:53,722
It's all right with me. I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.

187
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:55,762
Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us...

188
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,682
a little bit about who you are.

189
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:01,522
Just sketchily, you know... born, married, why I left my last job.

190
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:03,562
No, no, no, no. One moment, please.

191
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,562
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.

192
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:10,322
We entertain a celebrity, Miss Trowbridge.

193
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:15,282
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Don't tell me. Let me guess.

194
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:18,122
I know. Flagpole sitter.

195
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:21,402
- I know. He wrote some books. - No, he lived some books.

196
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:24,642
If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford...

197
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,842
who hunts big game so adventurously.

198
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,442
Yeah? Here's to ya.

199
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:31,602
- I've lugged a gun around a little. - "I've lugged a gun around a little. "

200
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:35,282
No, I have read your books. I read all books on hunting.

201
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:38,962
- A papiroso? - Thank you.

202
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:42,122
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view.

203
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:44,282
- What do you mean, "sane"? - Cigarette?

204
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:47,642
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks. - You do not excuse what needs no excuse.

205
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,562
Let me see. How did you put it?

206
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:52,602
"Hunting is as much a game as stud poker...

207
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,522
only the limits are higher. "

208
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:58,482
- You have put our case perfectly. - Then you're a hunter yourself?

209
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:03,282
We are kindred spirits. It is my one passion.

210
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:06,402
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.

211
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,042
And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.

212
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,562
We'll have capital sport together, I hope.

213
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,482
Don't encourage him.

214
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,402
He's had our two sailors so busy...

215
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,842
chasing around the woods after flora and fauna...

216
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:21,282
that we haven't seen them for three days.

217
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:25,882
But what do you hunt here?

218
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:29,842
I'll tell you. You will be amused, I know.

219
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,522
I have done a rare thing.

220
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:34,922
I have invented a new sensation.

221
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,162
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.

222
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:38,882
What is this sensation, Count?

223
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:42,722
Mr. Rainsford, God made some men poets.

224
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:46,122
Some He made kings, some beggars.

225
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:49,802
Me, He made a hunter.

226
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:54,842
My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.

227
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,882
He was a very rich man...

228
00:17:56,882 --> 00:18:00,362
with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.

229
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:03,802
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.

230
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:07,482
- Good for him. - My life has been one glorious hunt.

231
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:10,642
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.

232
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:17,042
- But when the revolution... - Look out.

233
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,442
Oh, I'm so sorry.

234
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:21,522
Count Zaroff was so interesting...

235
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:26,842
I didn't realize the danger.

236
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,202
Oh, it's all right now. What were you saying about the revolution, Count?

237
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:33,722
Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.

238
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:38,682
Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.

239
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,562
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.

240
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,482
That must have been a close call.

241
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,962
Yes. It still bothers me sometimes.

242
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:50,522
However, in two months I was on my way to the Amazon.

243
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:54,482
I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning.

244
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:57,482
No, no, no. No sport at all.

245
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:00,562
Well, conditions are bad everywhere these days.

246
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:03,802
One night, as I lay in my tent with this...

247
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:05,882
this head of mine...

248
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:09,962
a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.

249
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:13,042
Hunting was beginning to bore me.

250
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,882
Is that such a terrible thought, Count?

251
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:21,082
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.

252
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,402
When I lost my love of hunting...

253
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:31,122
I lost my love of life... of love.

254
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,522
Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.

255
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:37,082
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.

256
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:41,602
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow.

257
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,762
Tartar which?

258
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,642
Tartar war bow...

259
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:51,642
That one up there.

260
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,762
It's cute.

261
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:56,322
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it...

262
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,242
but alas, even that was too deadly.

263
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:02,442
What I needed was not a new weapon...

264
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,402
but a new animal.

265
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:08,042
- A new animal? - Exactly so.

266
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:11,602
You found one?

267
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,562
Yes.

268
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,362
Here on my island...

269
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:22,322
I hunt the most dangerous game.

270
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,962
"The most dangerous game"? You mean tigers?

271
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:29,522
Tigers? No.

272
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:35,842
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.

273
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:47,122
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water. Was that it?

274
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,042
It's no use, Rainsford.

275
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,962
He won't tell.

276
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:53,682
He won't even let you see his trophy room...

277
00:20:53,682 --> 00:20:58,162
till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.

278
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:02,842
My one secret. I keep it as a surprise for my guests...

279
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:05,122
against the rainy day of boredom.

280
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,162
You let me in on that game...

281
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,682
and I'll bet you I go for it.

282
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,362
You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.

283
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:15,202
If he says a thing is good, it is good.

284
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:18,122
He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract...

285
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,762
plays the piano... anything you want.

286
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:24,122
He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?

287
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,362
Yes, yes.

288
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:28,922
You want me to go hunting? You just say the word. We're pals.

289
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,722
We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.

290
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:33,642
A completely civilized point of view.

291
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:38,002
I tell you what you do. You come to my place in the Adirondacks, see.

292
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:42,202
We'll have a private car, liquor and gals on the trip...

293
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:46,642
and the guides will make the deers behave.

294
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:49,042
I think we'd better change the subject.

295
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,802
All right. Change the subject.

296
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:54,082
Oh, I know! Play the piano, huh?

297
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:56,322
If you wish.

298
00:21:56,322 --> 00:22:00,202
Good idea. Play the piano. Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.

299
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:04,202
Perhaps the count doesn't want to play.

300
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:06,442
There you go, sis, throwing cold water.

301
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,682
Leave me alone. I know where the piano is.

302
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:11,202
I'm perfectly sober.

303
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:13,562
Charming simplicity.

304
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:15,482
"Completely civilized," did you say?

305
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:19,002
He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt.

306
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:21,362
We barbarians know that it is after the chase...

307
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:24,482
and then only that man revels.

308
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,402
It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast.

309
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:29,602
Of course, yes. You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains...

310
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:32,602
"Hunt first the enemy, then the woman. "

311
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,522
That's the savages' idea everywhere.

312
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:36,682
It is the natural instinct.

313
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:40,122
What is woman... even such a woman as this...

314
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:43,802
until the blood is quickened by the kill?

315
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:46,562
- Oh, I don't know. - "Oh, I don't know. "

316
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:49,082
You Americans.

317
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:51,802
One passion builds upon another.

318
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:55,482
Kill! Then love.

319
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,442
When you have known that...

320
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:02,322
you will have known ecstasy.

321
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:05,442
Oh, Martin!

322
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:08,882
Here you see Zaroff, the keyboard king...

323
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:11,482
in his Branca Island hour.

324
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:13,522
Come on, Count. Now, you show them.

325
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,122
- What do you suggest? - Oh, just a good tune.

326
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,122
But not highbrow, like last night.

327
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:45,682
- Just a good tune, see? - I see.

328
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,802
Oh, his hunting dogs.

329
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,722
Keep your voice low and listen.

330
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,642
It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.

331
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:55,002
I heard it leave the boathouse last night. It returned this morning.

332
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,082
You mean he's keeping you from returning to the mainland?

333
00:23:57,082 --> 00:24:00,402
Yes.

334
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:03,442
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people.

335
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,842
Two, maybe. There were four of us a week ago.

336
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:10,842
- The other two have disappeared. - What do you mean?

337
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:12,762
One night after dinner, the count took one of our sailors...

338
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:15,762
down to see his trophy room...

339
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:18,642
at the foot of those stone steps.

340
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:20,842
- That iron door? - Yes.

341
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:24,122
Two nights later he took the other there.

342
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:26,802
Neither has been seen since.

343
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,722
Have you asked him about them?

344
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:30,722
He says they've gone hunting.

345
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:33,322
Oh, be careful. He's watching us.

346
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,762
Will you smile, as if I'd said something funny?

347
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:38,602
Now look here. You must be mistaken.

348
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,042
Not now.

349
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:45,122
Applaud.

350
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:48,722
- Attaboy! Attaboy! - Thank you.

351
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:51,322
What did I tell you? Smacks a mean ivory, eh, Rainsford?

352
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:53,242
It was splendid. Don't stop, please.

353
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:57,442
I'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience.

354
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:00,482
Well, I expect it's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford...

355
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:02,842
to concentrate on anything after all he's been through.

356
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:05,882
My dear lady, you are pleading for yourself.

357
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:09,882
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes.

358
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:13,122
Excuse me.

359
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:15,042
You know, the count's worse than a family governess.

360
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,642
Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children.

361
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:21,362
Oh, no, my dear. No.

362
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:25,962
Charming children.

363
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:27,882
There, you hear that, sis?

364
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:30,962
Now trot along upstairs and don't bother us grownups anymore.

365
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,442
Well, after that I guess... I guess I'll have to go.

366
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:36,442
- Good night, Mr. Rainsford. - Good night.

367
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:38,522
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast.

368
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:40,442
- Good night. - Good night.

369
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:47,642
Good night, sis. We won't be seeing each other at breakfast.

370
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:50,522
Oh, my dear Rainsford, I have been most inconsiderate.

371
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:52,882
You must be feeling the need of sleep too.

372
00:25:52,882 --> 00:26:02,242
- Yes, I am just about all in. - Then Ivan will show you to your room.

373
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:05,202
Oh, Martin, turn in early, please?

374
00:26:05,202 --> 00:26:10,002
Don't worry. The count'll take care of me, all right.

375
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:28,242
Indeed I shall.

376
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:30,722
- Well, good night. - Good night, sir.

377
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:42,042
Sleep well.

378
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:45,842
Oh, uh, well, here's to long life.

379
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:49,002
A long life.

380
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,442
Tell me, Mr. Trowbridge...

381
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,362
are you also fatigued?

382
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,282
Tired? Me?

383
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,202
You know I'm not.

384
00:26:57,202 --> 00:27:00,002
You know, Rainsford, we two are just alike.

385
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:03,282
Up all night and sleep all day.

386
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:06,562
Well, good night.

387
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:12,922
Well, what are we gonna do, huh?

388
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,162
What's the big idea?

389
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:17,682
I thought that perhaps...

390
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:22,682
tonight you would like to see my trophy room?

391
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,602
Your trophy room?

392
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:28,722
I'm sure you will find it most...

393
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,642
interesting.

394
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:32,882
Say, that's a great idea.

395
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:36,442
Ho-ho. Now we're pals. No more secrets now, huh?

396
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:39,682
- We'll make a night of it. - I hope so, Mr. Trowbridge.

397
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:43,082
Just you and I... pals. We'll have fun together, huh?

398
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:46,042
Precisely, yes.

399
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:47,962
Fun together.

400
00:27:47,962 --> 00:28:29,362
Attaboy, County, old boy, old boy, County.

401
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:31,282
Please let me come in.

402
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:34,922
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm frightened.

403
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,842
- What was it? Those dogs? - My brother.

404
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,162
I've been listening for hours for him to come upstairs.

405
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:41,882
I've just gone to his room. He isn't there!

406
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:45,042
- He's probably somewhere with the count. - That's just what I'm afraid of.

407
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:49,242
Count Zaroff is planning something... about my brother and me.

408
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,162
You don't really think anything has happened to your brother?

409
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,282
Oh, I don't know, but we've got to find him.

410
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:55,562
Won't you help me?

411
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:57,802
Why, of course I'll help you.

412
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:03,242
- Where do you think he's gone? - Where did the others go?

413
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,722
The iron door.

414
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:07,922
I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.

415
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:37,682
Thank you.

416
00:29:37,682 --> 00:30:33,242
That's queer. It's unlocked.

417
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:35,202
Zaroff! He's coming down.

418
00:30:35,202 --> 00:31:11,962
Back here, quick!

419
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:30,802
Where is my brother?

420
00:31:30,802 --> 00:31:33,882
You killed him!

421
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:36,562
You killed my brother!

422
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,482
You!

423
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:59,322
Why, you...

424
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:01,402
Come, come, my dear Rainsford.

425
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,242
I don't want to treat you like my other guests.

426
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:08,722
You and I, we are hunters.

427
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:11,642
So that's your most dangerous game.

428
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:14,842
Yes. My dear fellow, I intended to tell you last night...

429
00:32:14,842 --> 00:32:16,442
but you know, Miss Trowbridge...

430
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:18,122
You hunted him like an animal.

431
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,162
I know what you think, but you are wrong.

432
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:23,282
He was sober and fit for sport when I sent him out.

433
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:26,242
An hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses.

434
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:28,722
You raving maniac!

435
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:32,282
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it off... when we've finished.

436
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:37,122
The stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of Fog Hollow.

437
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,642
You see, when I first began stocking my island...

438
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:42,322
many of my guests thought I was joking...

439
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:45,162
so I established this trophy room.

440
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:48,282
I always bring them here before the hunt.

441
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:50,722
An hour with my trophies...

442
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,362
and they usually do their best to keep away from me.

443
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:56,162
Where do you get these poor devils?

444
00:32:56,162 --> 00:33:00,922
Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs.

445
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:03,362
But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel.

446
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:07,762
They do not always mark it.

447
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:10,202
- You shifted them. - Precisely right.

448
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:12,602
Too bad your yacht should have suffered...

449
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,802
but at least it brought us together.

450
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:17,202
You take half-drowned men from ships you've wrecked...

451
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:19,122
and drive them out to be hunted.

452
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,642
I give them every consideration...

453
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:23,882
good food, exercise...

454
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:26,322
everything to get them in splendid shape.

455
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:29,522
- To be shot down in cold blood. - Oh, no, no.

456
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:32,002
Oh, I admit, with this annoying fellow...

457
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:35,122
but usually I give them hunting clothes...

458
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:38,282
a woodsman's knife and a full day's start.

459
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:42,402
I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark.

460
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:45,002
And if one eludes me only till sunrise...

461
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:48,402
he wins the game.

462
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:53,042
Suppose he refuses to be hunted.

463
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:57,322
Ivan is such an artist with these.

464
00:33:57,322 --> 00:34:02,522
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose to hunt.

465
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:09,322
And when they win?

466
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:12,402
To date I have not lost.

467
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:15,402
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find this game worth playing.

468
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:18,882
When the next ship arrives, we'll have gorgeous sport together.

469
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:22,722
You murdering rat! I'm a hunter not an assassin.

470
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:27,162
Come, Rainsford. Say you will hunt with me.

471
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:30,042
Hunt men?

472
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:37,522
Say you will hunt with me!

473
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,442
No?

474
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:42,682
What do you think I am?

475
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:45,682
One, I fear, who dare not follow his own convictions...

476
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:48,642
to their logical conclusion.

477
00:34:48,642 --> 00:34:52,322
I'm afraid in this instance, Mr. Rainsford...

478
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:56,442
you may have to follow them.

479
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:58,602
What do you mean?

480
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:02,882
I shall not wait for the next ship.

481
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:10,282
Four o'clock. The sun is just rising.

482
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:27,562
Come, Mr. Rainsford. Let us not waste time.

483
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:34,082
Ivan.

484
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:37,562
Your fangs and claws, Mr. Rainsford.

485
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:51,362
Bob! Bob!

486
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:53,282
Lvan.

487
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:56,282
Bob! Bob, what are they going to do?

488
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:58,842
- I'm going to be hunted. - Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.

489
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:00,762
Outdoor chess.

490
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,682
His brain against mine.

491
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:06,402
His good craft against mine.

492
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:10,082
- And the prize? - The prize?

493
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:13,362
You may recall what I said last evening.

494
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:15,642
Only after the kill...

495
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:20,362
does man know the true ecstasy of love.

496
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,522
Suppose you lose.

497
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:25,362
If I do not...

498
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:27,962
What shall I say?.. Find you...

499
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:32,682
between midnight and sunrise tomorrow, freedom for both of you.

500
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:35,682
- I'm going with you. - No. He'll kill you too.

501
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:39,122
Not at all. One does not kill a female animal.

502
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:41,722
If you lose, I can easily recapture her alive.

503
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,002
All right. I'll take her with me then.

504
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:51,562
We'll set him a trail he'll remember.

505
00:36:51,562 --> 00:36:57,402
It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.

506
00:36:57,402 --> 00:37:13,082
Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.

507
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:16,162
Don't lose your nerve. We'll beat this thing.

508
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:27,842
- The others didn't. - We will.

509
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:56,922
Come on. Let's get going.

510
00:37:56,922 --> 00:37:59,282
It seems as though we've come miles.

511
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:02,922
Yeah, but three hours doesn't take you far in this jungle.

512
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:04,842
Come on. Let's keep going.

513
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:14,442
Come on.

514
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:17,722
Just a little more of this, then easy downhill going.

515
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:42,842
We'll soon be safe.

516
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:45,242
No wonder he was so sure.

517
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,922
This island is no bigger than a deer park.

518
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:50,882
Oh, Bob!

519
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,722
Come on, now.

520
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,642
What are we going to do?

521
00:38:55,642 --> 00:39:00,242
We didn't each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us.

522
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:03,762
I shouldn't have come with you. You might beat him if you were alone.

523
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:06,882
Alone? And leave you here with that savage?

524
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:10,642
Not a chance.

525
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,522
Now we've got to think of something to worry him.

526
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:16,442
You'd never get near him. He'd shoot on sight.

527
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:18,962
Weapons aren't everything in the jungle.

528
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:22,722
Say, did you notice that leaning tree down there?

529
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:30,042
- The one we just passed? - Yes. I want to show you something.

530
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:33,082
You see? If that supporting branch were cut away...

531
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:35,322
this fallen tree would make a perfect Malay deadfall.

532
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:37,242
A Malay deadfall? What's that?

533
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:39,642
A man-killing contraption the natives use.

534
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:41,722
It would stop that madman, all right.

535
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:43,802
Trouble is, it takes quite a few hours to build.

536
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:45,722
He said he wouldn't follow till midnight.

537
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:48,842
That's right. If you help me, I think we'll have time.

538
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:55,282
Come on. We'll cut some strong vines.

539
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:58,162
There. Almost ready.

540
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,682
This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie.

541
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:03,882
He'll have been on his way almost an hour now.

542
00:40:03,882 --> 00:40:06,042
Look out! Don't touch that trip line.

543
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,322
You'll have a two-ton tree down on your back.

544
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,322
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron. - Will it really work?

545
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:14,202
I've never known a living thing to get by one yet.

546
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:17,482
Look here. You touch that trip line...

547
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,562
it'll pull that trigger free.

548
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:22,762
Once that's loose, there's nothing to keep the log from coming down.

549
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:29,042
It'll crash down and kill anything underneath it.

550
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:35,762
Look.

551
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:54,322
We're ready. Let him come.

552
00:40:54,322 --> 00:41:54,842
Give me that knife.

553
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,882
Come out, Rainsford.

554
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:58,802
Why prolong it?

555
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:00,722
I'll not bungle this shot.

556
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:04,122
You'll never even feel it.

557
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,602
But surely you don't think that anyone who has hunted leopards...

558
00:42:07,602 --> 00:42:15,842
would follow you into that ambush?

559
00:42:15,842 --> 00:42:19,762
Oh, very well. If you choose to play the leopard...

560
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:40,482
I shall hunt you like a leopard.

561
00:42:40,482 --> 00:43:05,962
Wait. Maybe it's a trick.

562
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:18,002
Eve.

563
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:19,922
Why did he go?

564
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:22,362
He's playing with us... like a cat with a mouse.

565
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:24,282
What do you mean?

566
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,362
You heard him say he'd hunt us as he'd hunt a leopard.

567
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:28,282
That means he's gone for his high-powered rifle.

568
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:31,082
His rifle? Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!

569
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:53,362
- Run, quick! - Eve, wait.

570
00:43:53,362 --> 00:43:56,242
- No, I tell you, no! - Don't stop! No!

571
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,202
Wait. That's Fog Hollow ahead.

572
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:02,042
- Fog Hollow? - The swamp where he caught the others.

573
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,562
We haven't a chance of keeping ahead of him there.

574
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:07,282
- But there's no place else to run. - That's just what he's counting on.

575
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:10,682
We've got two hours till dawn. We've got to use our brains instead of our legs.

576
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,602
But he'll have his rifle.

577
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:15,482
And we'll have a man trap. Look.

578
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:26,002
It makes me dizzy.

579
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:27,962
Cover this over.

580
00:44:27,962 --> 00:44:31,482
When Mr. Zaroff falls down there, he'll be all through hunting.

581
00:44:31,482 --> 00:46:17,842
Quick. Gather some leaves and grass. I'll cut some branches.

582
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,962
Yes. Very good, Rainsford.

583
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:23,882
Very good.

584
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,402
You have not won yet.

585
00:46:26,402 --> 00:46:31,082
Look at your watch.

586
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:33,002
Are you looking at it?

587
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:35,522
Still half an hour till sunrise.

588
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:39,042
Swamp or no swamp, we can keep ahead of him that long.

589
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:43,122
As you are doubtless saying, the odds are against me.

590
00:46:43,122 --> 00:46:47,322
You have made my rifle useless in the fog.

591
00:46:47,322 --> 00:50:51,442
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle.

592
00:50:51,442 --> 00:54:44,442
Those animals I cornered... now I know how they felt.

593
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:48,562
Achmed, Miss Trowbridge...

594
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:51,722
bring her here.

595
00:54:51,722 --> 00:55:46,322
Now!

596
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:56,922
My dear Rainsford, I congratulate you.

597
00:55:56,922 --> 00:56:00,682
You have beaten me.

598
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:02,602
Not yet.

599
00:56:02,602 --> 00:56:11,122
Oh, but of course. I insist.

600
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:13,722
Why, you're...

601
00:56:13,722 --> 00:56:15,922
You're not even wounded.

602
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:17,882
You hit the dog not me.

603
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:22,322
I took a chance and went over with him.

604
00:56:22,322 --> 00:56:24,722
A clever trick, Rainsford.

605
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:29,642
I cheerfully admit defeat.

606
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:33,482
Here's the key of the boathouse.

607
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:35,402
The door is in the trophy room.

608
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:38,482
You and Miss Trowbridge may leave at once.

609
00:56:38,482 --> 00:57:57,922
No!

610
00:57:57,922 --> 00:58:06,722
Ohh!

611
00:58:06,722 --> 00:58:15,362
Bob!

612
00:58:15,362 --> 00:58:18,922
Eve!

613
00:58:18,922 --> 00:59:15,602
The boat! Quick!

614
00:59:15,602 --> 00:59:45,642
Impossible.

615
00:59:45,642 --> 99:59:59,999

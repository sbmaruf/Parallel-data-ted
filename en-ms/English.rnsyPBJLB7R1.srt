1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:10,380
Estimate the solution to 582,205
plus 610,859, rounding

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,660
these two numbers to the
nearest thousand.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,430
So we going to round each of
these numbers to the nearest

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,980
thousand and then add them,
and that'll give us an

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,440
estimate to this solution.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,310
So let's do each of
these numbers.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:31,760
So if we start off with 582,205,
we want to round to

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,795
the nearest thousand.

9
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,860
So you go to the thousands
place, and you go one place

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,740
below that.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,310
If that's 5 or greater,
round up.

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,240
If it's less than
5, round down.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,620
This is less than 5.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,010
The 2 here is less than 5,
so we want round down.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,860
We are going to round it down,
so it's going to be 582,000.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,560
We're just going to round
it down to 2,000.

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,100
We're going to get rid of
all of this 205 here.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,910
582,000 when we rounded it down
to the nearest thousand.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,910
Now, we have 610,859.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,090
Same drill.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,670
Go to the thousands place.

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,560
That's the 0 right there.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,300
Look one place below the
thousands place.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,080
This is that 8 right there.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,850
If this is 5 or greater,
you round up.

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,310
Less than 5, round down.

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,460
It is 5 or greater.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,160
8 is greater than 5.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,950
Or it could even be 5 and we'd
still around up, so we're

30
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,240
going to round up in
this situation.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,680
We're going to round up, so we
end up with 600, and instead

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,570
of 610,000, we're rounding
up to 611,000.

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,790
We've rounded the two numbers
to the nearest thousand.

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,796
Now we're ready to add.

35
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,490
So let's add them.

36
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,330
Let's add the two numbers.

37
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,800
0 plus 0 is 0.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
0 plus 0 is 0.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,860
0 plus 0 is 0.

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,230
2 plus 1 is 3.

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,440
8 plus 1 is 9.

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,230
5 plus 6 is 11.

43
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,130
If there were more places here,
we would carry the 1 in

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,030
the tens place.

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,230
But there isn't, so you can
just write an 11 here.

46
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,380
And so we are left with-- put
a comma every third digit--

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,200
1,193,000, which is
our estimate.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,790
And the whole reason why this
is useful is if someone were

49
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,740
to give these numbers to you and
you had to do it in your

50
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,080
head, it's hard to add these
whole numbers, but you might

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,240
be able to do 582 plus
611, knowing

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,830
everything is in thousands.

53
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,780
So it allows you to do things
in your head a little bit

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,550
easier when you round, and then
you estimate the sum of

55
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,570
the rounded numbers.

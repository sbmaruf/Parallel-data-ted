1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,950
A thermometer in a science
lab displays the temperature

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,730
in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,410
If the mercury in
the thermometer

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,880
rises to 56 degrees
Fahrenheit-- they're

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,110
giving us the
Fahrenheit temperature--

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,540
what is the corresponding
Celsius temperature?

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,704
And then they give
us the two formulas,

9
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:17,370
that if we know the
Celsius temperature,

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,382
how do we figure out the
Fahrenheit temperature,

11
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:21,090
or if we know the
Fahrenheit temperature,

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,120
how do we figure out
the Celsius temperature.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,130
And these are actually
derived from each other,

14
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,338
and you'll learn more about
that when you do algebra.

15
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:29,060
And we also-- maybe
in another video--

16
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,843
will explain how
to derive these.

17
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,259
It's actually kind
of interesting,

18
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,530
involves a little
bit of algebra.

19
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,750
But they gave us the formula.

20
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,810
So they really just want us to
apply it, and maybe make sure

21
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,877
we understand which
one we should apply.

22
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:41,960
Well, they're giving us
the Fahrenheit temperature

23
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,530
right here, so F is
going to be equal to 56.

24
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,990
And they're asking us for
the Celsius temperature,

25
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,570
so we need to figure out what
the Celsius temperature is.

26
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,570
Well, in this one over here,
if you know the Fahrenheit

27
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,260
temperature, then you can solve
for the Celsius temperature.

28
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,360
So let's use this
right over here.

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,880
So our Celsius
temperature is going

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,780
to be 5/9 times the Fahrenheit
temperature-- the Fahrenheit

31
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,578
temperature is 56 degrees
Fahrenheit-- minus 32.

32
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:13,290

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,090
Well, 56 minus 32 is 24.

34
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,490
So this is going to be
equal to 5/9 times 24.

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,920
And this is the same thing
as 5 times 24, over 9.

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,420
And before I even
multiply out 5 times 24,

37
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,260
we can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 3.

38
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,270
So let's do that.

39
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,760
If we divide the numerator
by 3 and the denominator,

40
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,190
we're not changing the value.

41
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,850
24 divided by 3 is 8.

42
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,440
9 divided by 3 is 3.

43
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,880
So it becomes 5 times 8,
which is 40, over 3 degrees.

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,921
And if we want to write
this as a number that

45
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,170
makes a little bit more sense
in terms of temperature,

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,460
let's divide 3 into 40 to get
the number of degrees we have.

47
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,060
3 goes into 4 one time.

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,610
1 times 3 is 3.

49
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,550
Subtract.

50
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,120
4 minus 3 is 1.

51
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Bring down the 0.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,960
3 goes into 10 three times.

53
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,810
3 times 3 is 9.

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,880
Subtract.

55
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,020
Get a 1.

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,860
And then you could
bring down another 0.

57
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,810
We now have a decimal
point over here.

58
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,050
You're going to get a 0 here.

59
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,150
3 goes into, once
again, 10 three times.

60
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,980
And this 3 is going
to repeat forever.

61
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,960
So you could view this--
this is equal to 13.333--

62
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,290
it'll just keep repeating.

63
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,700
This little line on top means
repeating-- degrees Celsius.

64
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,096
Or you could say that, look,
3 goes into 40 13 times

65
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,910
with a remainder of 1.

66
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,040
So you could say that this is
also equal to 13, remainder 1.

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,600
So 13 and 1/3 degrees Celsius.

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,740
Either way, it works.

69
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,470
But that's our
Celsius temperature

70
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,520
when our Fahrenheit
temperature is 56 degrees.

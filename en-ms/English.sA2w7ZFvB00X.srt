Superstar, come come come get it!

4
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,292
Is there a heart branching out of the iron

5
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:15,960
Is love calling on me for the first time

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,565
Is there a heart branching out of the iron

7
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:23,255
Is love calling me for the first time

8

Zero (0) goes with one There's scent of flower from today

9
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:30,792
There are stars in the sky and Lightning in my eyes

10
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,450
Searches within me that Google hasn't seen Girl

11
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,949
Oh girl, I have love for you, that the world has never seen

12
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:47,343

I Am A Super Girl [I'm your love, Rapper Girl]

14
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,910
You are all the numbers that are inside me

15
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:04,011
I will borrow electricity from the corner of your eyes

16
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:07,617
I shall smile with you using my blue tooth

17
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:11,332
I will hug you with my engine heart

18
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:15,128
I shall shut myself off when you go to sleep

19
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,833

Watch Me Robo Shake It I Know You Want To Break It

21
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:26,037
You could get a shock when you touch me

22
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:29,634
My motor speed could increase when we make love

23
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:34,047
My battery could be flat at the middle of the night

24
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:51,925
I imprisoned the young girl in my memory

25
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:55,699
I was restless when you missed to shut me down at night

26
00:02:57,434 --> 00:03:01,327
I kept reading you till my sensors stopped workings

27
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:05,814
It's because of you that I forgot my conventions

28
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:10,334
Will you accept my salivaless kiss without any fight

29
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,020
Will you ask me to leave because this is bloodless love?

30
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,729
I may be a robot biologically

31
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,416
But I am a cupid psychologically

32
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:25,219
I got the curse of eternity. I came onto earth

33
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,126
and brought along an everlasting love

34
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:37,590
Hey Robot, don't lure me

35
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,836

00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,871
Go away, don't hit on me

46
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,131

Romancing Robot

48

You're not needed. Go away

49
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:07,715
Is there a heart branching out of the iron

50
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,368
Is love calling on me for the first time

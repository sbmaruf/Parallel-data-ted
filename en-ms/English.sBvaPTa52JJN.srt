Identify complementary and supplementary angles in the image below

2
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:07,318
So, just as a reminder:

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,621
Complementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees,

4
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:15,441
and supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,420
So let's look at this diagram

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,338
First let's look for the complementary angles

7
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:26,931
so angles that add up to 90 degrees.

8
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:28,905
And so they drew this right angle over here

9
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,811
so we know that angle FAH is a right angle

10
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:33,759
because of this half box right over there.

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,638
And it's made up of two adjacent angles.

12
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:39,068
And these two adjacent angles make up a 90 degree angle

13
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:41,871
so they must add up to 90 degrees.

14
00:00:41,871 --> 00:01:02,067
So the two angles, angle FAC, and angle CAH

15
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:05,267
are complementary because the measures of these two angles

16
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,254
must add up to 180 degrees, oh sorry...

17
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:11,068
must add up to this 90 degrees, right over here.

18
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:14,618
And I think that's all the complementary angles, just these two.

19
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:17,470
They add up to this right angle - to this 90 degrees.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,002
Now let's think about the supplementary angles.

21
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,954
so supplementary angles

22
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,444
They add up to 180 degrees.

23
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:34,396
So you have angle FAC, or we could call it CAF- its the same angle

24
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:37,380
So angle CAF

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,817
and then this angle out here

26
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:44,718
FAB, they're adjacent to each other

27
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,841
and they clearly form a straight angle, which is 180 degrees

28
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,613
when you add their two measures.

29
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:52,995
So these two are clearly supplementary.

30
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:57,062
and angle FAB.

31
00:01:57,062 --> 00:02:03,557
CAF and FAB together definitely add up to 180 degrees so they're supplementary.

32
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,393
And the other one:

33
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:12,067
we could do angle CAH, which is this right over here

34
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,745
that plus HAB clearly add up

35
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:18,961
they're adjacent, they form a straight angle

36
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,391
so they're clearly adding up to 180 degrees.

37
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,129
So they're also supplementary.

38
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,141
CAH and angle HAB.

39
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,748
And we're done!

40
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,660
These two angles add up to 90

41
00:02:31,660 --> 99:59:59,999
these two add up to 180, these two also add up to 180.

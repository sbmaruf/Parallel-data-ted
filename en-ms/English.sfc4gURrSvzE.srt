1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the Awesome story:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It begins about 40 years ago,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And they got here in the late 1960s.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and they settled into a new life.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They saw their first dentist,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
they ate their first hamburger,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and they had their first kids.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My sister and I

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
grew up here,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We had close family,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
good friends, a quiet street.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We grew up taking for granted

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
when they grew up --

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
things like power always on

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
in our houses,

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
things like schools across the street

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and hospitals down the road

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and popsicles in the backyard.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We grew up, and we grew older.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I went to high school.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I graduated.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I moved out of the house, I got a job,

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I found a girl, I settled down --

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
(Laughter)

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but life was pretty good.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Life was pretty good.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
2006 was a great year.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I got married,

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
surrounded by 150 family and friends.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
2007 was a great year.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I graduated from school,

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We actually saw seals out of our car window,

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and then blocked them with our giant heads.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
(Laughter)

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So you can't actually see them,

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but it was breathtaking,

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
believe me.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
(Laughter)

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
not just me.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
First of all, the news was so heavy.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
it was about ice caps melting,

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
wars going on around the world,

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
earthquakes, hurricanes

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and then eventually did collapse,

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and so many of us losing our homes,

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
or our jobs,

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
or our retirements,

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
or our livelihoods.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My marriage wasn't going well,

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and we just were growing further and further apart.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
One day my wife came home from work

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to have a very honest conversation.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
until only a month later,

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
had been battling mental illness for some time.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And for those of you

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
you know how challenging it can be.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
on a Sunday night.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Very sadly, he took his own life.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And it was a really heavy time.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And as these dark clouds were circling me,

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and I was finding it really, really difficult

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to think of anything good,

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I said to myself that I really needed a way

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to focus on the positive somehow.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I came home from work one night,

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and I logged onto the computer,

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and I started up a tiny website

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
called 1000awesomethings.com.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was trying to remind myself

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but we just don't talk about enough --

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
things like waiters and waitresses

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
who bring you free refills without asking,

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
being the first table to get called up

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and you get to be first in line --

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
(Laughter)

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And slowly over time,

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I started putting myself in a better mood.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, 50,000 blogs

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
are started a day,

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And nobody read it except for my mom.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and go up by 100 percent

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
when she forwarded it to my dad.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
(Laughter)

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And then I got excited

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
when it started getting tens of hits,

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and then hundreds and then thousands

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and then millions.

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then I got a phone call,

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and the voice at the other end of the line said,

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I was like, that sounds totally fake.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
(Laughter)

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
(Applause)

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
(Laughter)

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and I ended up walking a red carpet

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And the surprise

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and just the amazement of that

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
when, in my inbox,

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
10 literary agents were waiting for me

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to talk about putting this into a book.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Flash-forward to the next year

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
(Applause)

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So let's talk about those three As.

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Over the last few years,

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I haven't had that much time to really think.

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that helped me grow my website,

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but also grow myself?"

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
as three As.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They are Attitude, Awareness

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and Authenticity.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So Attitude:

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Look, we're all going to get lumps,

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and we're all going to get bumps.

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We will all have high highs

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and big days and proud moments

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
of smiles on graduation stages,

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
father-daughter dances at weddings

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
but between those high highs,

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but your husband might leave you,

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
your girlfriend could cheat,

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's not a happy thought,

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs

183
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
or bad scenes.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Your mom could get cancer,

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
your dad could get mean.

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And there are times in life

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
when you will be tossed in the well, too,

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and when that bad news washes over you,

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I just really hope you feel

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
like you've always got two choices.

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
One, you can swirl and twirl

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and gloom and doom forever,

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or two, you can grieve

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and then face the future

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
with newly sober eyes.

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
no matter what pain hits you,

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
choosing to move forward and move on

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and take baby steps into the future.

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The second "A" is Awareness.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I love hanging out with three year-olds.

205
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I love the way that they see the world,

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
because they're seeing the world for the first time.

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
at their first baseball game

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and the smell of the hotdogs.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard

214
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and putting them into a nice centerpiece

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
for Thanksgiving dinner.

216
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I love the way that they see the world,

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
because they're seeing the world

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
for the first time.

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Having a sense of awareness

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because you all used to be three years old.

222
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.

223
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.

224
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They're in there.

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And being aware is just about remembering

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that you saw everything you've seen

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
for the first time once, too.

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So there was a time when it was your first time ever

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and smelt the bakery air,

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and said, "Found money."

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The last "A" is Authenticity.

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's go all the way back to 1932

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
grew up and grew into

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He's number 76 in the picture.

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you did not want to go up against.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They were tough football players doing what they love,

247
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
which was crushing skulls

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and separating shoulders on the football field.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But Rosey Grier also had

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
another passion.

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
In his deeply authentic self,

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He loved knitting.

254
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's what he said.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
he started joining clubs.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And he even put out a book

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
(Laughter)

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
(Applause)

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a great cover.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
(Laughter)

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And so what I love about this story

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is that Rosey Grier

268
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
is just such an authentic person,

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and that's what authenticity is all about.

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I think when you're authentic,

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you end up following your heart,

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and you put yourself in places

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and situations and in conversations

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that you love and that you enjoy.

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You meet people that you like talking to.

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You go places you've dreamt about.

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And you end you end up following your heart

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and feeling very fulfilled.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So those are the three A's.

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to my parents coming to Canada.

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know what it would feel like

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know, because I never did it,

286
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and appreciating the small wonders

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that you're starting to see in your new world.

290
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you'd have to be really true to yourself

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.

293
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
for about 10 seconds right now,

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and my parents are sitting in the front row.

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:30,000
(Applause)

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
of his first day in Canada.

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And it's a great story, because what happened was

303
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
(Laughter)

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
for all the new immigrants to Canada.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and there was this huge spread.

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
there was olives, those little white onions.

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and little cubes of cheese.

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and salmon salad sandwiches.

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,

319
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And when my dad tells the story, he says,

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
(Laughter)

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was eating olives with pie.

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
(Laughter)

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."

328
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
(Laughter)

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When I was five years old,

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,

331
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and he would stare in wonder

332
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They've got an apple here from South Africa.

335
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"

337
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Is this A&P?"

339
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And when we did, my dad would say,

344
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,

345
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
drove it all the way to the docks

347
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and then sailed it all the way

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
across the Atlantic Ocean

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and then put it in another truck

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,

351
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."

353
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."

355
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.

356
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There are so many things to be happy about.

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We are the only species

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
on the only life-giving rock

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,

360
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
capable of experiencing

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
so many of these things.

362
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.

363
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.

364
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,

365
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
interior design and horoscope signs.

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.

367
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.

369
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You can sleep in clean sheets.

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You can go to the movies and get good seats.

373
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.

375
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We've got all that,

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.

377
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And that's the sad part.

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The cashiers at your grocery store,

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
the foreman at your plant,

380
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
every teacher you've ever had,

383
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,

384
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
every politician in every country,

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
every actor in every movie,

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
every single person in your family, everyone you love,

387
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
everyone in this room and you

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
will be dead in a hundred years.

389
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Life is so great that we only get such a short time

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to experience and enjoy

391
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And that moment is right now,

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and those moments are counting down,

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

395
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You will never be as young as you are right now.

396
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that's why I believe that if you live your life

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
with a great attitude,

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
choosing to move forward and move on

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
whenever life deals you a blow,

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
embracing your inner three year-old

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet

403
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and being authentic to yourself,

404
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
being you and being cool with that,

405
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
then I think you'll live a life

407
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
that is rich and is satisfying,

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.

409
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Thank you.

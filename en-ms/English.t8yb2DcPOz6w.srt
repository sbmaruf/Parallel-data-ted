1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,930
We're told the triangle ABC
has perimeter P and inradius r

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,590
and then they want us
to find the area of ABC

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,129
in terms of P and r.

5
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,670
So we know that the
perimeter is just

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,900
the sum of the sides
of the triangle,

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,430
or how long a fence
would have to be

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,380
if you wanted to go
around the triangle.

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,030
And let's just remind
ourselves what the inradius is.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,230
If we take the angle
bisectors of each of these

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,620
vertices-- each of these
angles right over here.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,850
So bisect that right over
there and then bisect

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,370
that right over there.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,910
This angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,530
This angle is going to
be equal to that angle

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,860
and then this angle is going to
be equal to that angle there.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,470
And the point where those angle
bisectors intersect, that right

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,210
over there, is our
incenter and it

19
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,180
is equidistant from
all of the three sides.

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,210
And the distance from those
sides, that's the inradius.

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,836
So let me draw the inradius.

22
00:00:58,836 --> 00:01:01,210
So when you find the distance
between a point and a line,

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,584
you want to drop
a perpendicular.

24
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,050
So this length right over
here is the inradius.

25
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,370
This length right over
here is the inradius

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,920
and this length right
over here is the inradius.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,700
And if you want, you could
draw an incircle here

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,330
with the center at the
incenter and with the radius r

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,450
and that circle would
look something like this.

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,924
We don't have to necessarily
draw it for this problem.

31
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,340
So you could draw a circle
that looks something like that.

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,930
And then we'd call
that the incircle.

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,850
So let's think about how we can
find the area here, especially

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,886
in terms of this inradius.

35
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:34,510
Well, the cool thing
about the inradius

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,110
is it looks like the
altitude-- or this looks

37
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,280
like the altitude for this
triangle right over here,

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,440
triangle A. Let's
label the center.

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,090
Let's call it I for incenter.

40
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,360
This r right over here is
the altitude of triangle AIC.

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,710
This r is the altitude
of triangle BIC.

42
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,020
And this r, which we didn't
label, that r right over there

43
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,170
is the altitude of triangle AIB.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,432
And we know-- and
so we could find

45
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:02,890
the area of each
of those triangles

46
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,210
in terms of both
r and their bases

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,030
and maybe if we sum up the
area of all the triangles,

48
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,380
we can get something in terms of
our perimeter and our inradius.

49
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,050
So let's just try to do this.

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,440
So the area of the entire
triangle, the area of ABC,

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,140
is going to be
equal to-- and I'll

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,100
color code this-- is going to
be equal to the area of AIC.

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,890
So that's what I'm
shading here in magenta.

54
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,750
It's going to be equal to
the area of AIC plus the area

55
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,551
of BIC, which is this
triangle right over here.

56
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,425
Actually let me do that
in a different color.

57
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,880
I've already used the blue.

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,430
So let me do that in orange.

59
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,890
Plus the area of BIC.

60
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,160
So that's this area
right over here.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,160

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,960
And then finally plus the area--
I'll do this in a, let's see,

63
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,216
I'll use this pink color--
plus the area of AIB.

64
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:07,040

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,239
That is the area AIB.

66
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,280
Take the sum of the areas
of these two triangles,

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,590
you got the area of
the larger triangle.

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,030
Now AIC, the area
of AIC, is going

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,700
to be equal to 1/2
base times height.

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,760
So this is going to be 1/2.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
The base is the length
of AC, 1/2 AC times

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,030
the height-- times this
altitude right over here,

73
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,410
which is just going
to be r-- times r.

74
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,390
That's the area of AIC.

75
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,280
And then the area of BIC is
going to be 1/2 the base,

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,540
which is BC, times the
height, which is r.

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,260
And then plus the area of
AIB, this one over here,

78
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,620
is going to be 1/2
the base, which

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,580
is the length of this side
AB, times the height, which

80
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,090
is once again r.

81
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,900
And over here, we can factor out
a 1/2 r from all of these terms

82
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:16,233
and you get 1/2 r times
AC plus BC plus AB.

83
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,899
And I think you see
where this is going.

84
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,324
Plus-- now that's a different
shade of pink-- plus AB.

85
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,680

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,555
Now what is AC plus BC plus AB?

87
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:32,760

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,607
Well that's going to
be the perimeter, P,

89
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,190
if you just take the
sum of the sides.

90
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,110
So that is the perimeter of P
and it looks like we're done.

91
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:51,680
The area of our triangle ABC
is equal to 1/2 times r times

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,750
the perimeter, which is
kind of a neat result.

93
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,635
1/2 times the inradius times
the perimeter of the triangle.

94
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,510
Or sometimes you'll see
it written like this.

95
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,680
It's equal to r times P
over s-- sorry, P over 2.

96
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,290
And this term right over here,
the perimeter divided by 2,

97
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,873
is sometimes called
the semiperimeter.

98
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:17,120

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,940
And sometimes it's denoted
by s so sometimes you'll

100
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,760
see the area is
equal to r times s,

101
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,595
where s is the semiperimeter.

102
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,001
It's the perimeter divided by 2.

103
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,750
I personally like it
this way a little bit

104
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,055
more because I remember
that P is perimeter.

105
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,430
This is useful because obviously
now if someone gives you

106
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,400
an inradius and a perimeter,
you can figure out

107
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,640
the area of a triangle.

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,680
Or if someone gives you
the area of the triangle

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,513
and the perimeter, you
can get the inradius.

110
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:42,630
So if they give you
two of these variables,

111
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,140
you can always get the third.

112
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,940
So for example, if this was
a triangle right over here,

113
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,750
this is maybe the most famous
of the right triangles.

114
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,235
If I have a triangle that
has lengths 3, 4, and 5,

115
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,610
we know this is
a right triangle.

116
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,674
You can verify this from
the Pythagorean theorem.

117
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,090
And if someone
were to say what is

118
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,420
the inradius of this
triangle right over here?

119
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,626
Well we can figure out
the area pretty easily.

120
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,000
We know this is
a right triangle.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,800
3 squared plus 4 squared
is equal to 5 squared.

122
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,370
So the area is going to be
equal to 3 times 4 times 1/2.

123
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,040
So 3 times 4 times
1/2 is 6 and then

124
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,170
the perimeter here
is going to be

125
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,690
equal to 3 plus 4, which
is 7, plus 5 is 12.

126
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,670
And so we have the area.

127
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,720
So let's write this area is
equal to 1/2 times the inradius

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,510
times the perimeter.

129
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,770
So here we have 12 is equal
to 1/2 times the inradius

130
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,750
times the perimeter.

131
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,750
So we have-- oh
sorry, we have 6.

132
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,720
Let me write this in.

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,620
The area is 6.

134
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,200
We have 6 is equal to 1/2
times the inradius times 12.

135
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,170
And so in this situation,
1/2 times 12 is just 6.

136
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,310
We have 6 is equal to 6r.

137
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,560
Divide both sides by 6,
you get r is equal to 1.

138
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,440
So if you were to draw
the inradius for this one,

139
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,120
which is kind of a neat result.

140
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,245
So let me draw some
angle bisectors here.

141
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:13,830

142
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,570
This 3, 4, 5 right triangle
has an inradius of 1.

143
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,980
So this distance
equals this distance,

144
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,530
which is equal to
this distance, which

145
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,290
is equal to 1, which is
kind of a neat result.

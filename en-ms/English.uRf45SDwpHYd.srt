1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,465
We're told that quadrilateral
ABCD is a rhombus.

3
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:07,670
And what they want us to
prove is that their diagonals

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,340
are perpendicular, that
AC is perpendicular to BD.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,100
Now let's think about everything
we know about a rhombus.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,379
First of all, a rhombus
is a special case

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,690
of a parallelogram.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,620
In a parallelogram, the
opposite sides are parallel.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,630
So that side is
parallel to that side.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,890
These two sides are parallel.

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,330
And in a rhombus, not only are
the opposite sides parallel--

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,670
it's a parallelogram--
but also, all of the sides

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,920
have equal length.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,060
So this side is equal
to this side, which

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,170
is equal to that side,
which is equal to that side

16
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,200
right over there.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,860
Now, there's other
interesting things

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,740
we know about the diagonals
of a parallelogram, which

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,040
we know all rhombi
are parallelograms.

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,840
The other way around is
not necessarily true.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,670
We know that for any
parallelogram-- and a rhombus

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,660
is a parallelogram-- that the
diagonals bisect each other.

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,210
So for example, let me label
this point in the center.

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,885
Let me label it point E.

25
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:04,040
We know that AE is
going to be equal to EC.

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,560
I'll put two slashes
right over there.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,290
And we also know that EB
is going to be equal to ED.

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,820
So this is all of what
we know when someone just

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,350
says that ABCD is a rhombus,
based on other things

30
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,300
that we've proven to ourselves.

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,000
Now we need to prove that
AC is perpendicular to BD.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,550
So an interesting way to prove
it-- and you can look at it

33
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,770
just by eyeballing it-- is if we
can show that this triangle is

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,592
congruent to this triangle and
that these two angles right

35
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,050
over here correspond
to each other,

36
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,290
then they have to be the same.

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,831
And they'll be supplementary,
and then they'll be 90 degrees.

38
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,530
So let's just prove
it to ourselves.

39
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,180
So the first thing we see
is we have a side, a side,

40
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,430
and a side; a side,
a side, and a side.

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,108
So we can see that triangle--
let me write it here.

42
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:56,573
Let me [? do this ?]
in a new color.

43
00:01:56,573 --> 00:02:08,655
We see that triangle ABE is
congruent to triangle CBE.

44
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:11,649

45
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:15,930
And we know that by
side-side-side congruency.

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,969
We have a side, a side,
and a side; a side, a side,

47
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,402
and a side.

48
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:21,860
And then once we
know that, we know

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,120
that all the corresponding
angles are congruent.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,380
And in particular, we
know that angle AEB

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,948
is going to be
congruent to angle CEB.

52
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,860

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:48,810
Because they are corresponding
angles of congruent triangles.

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,070
So this angle right
over here is going

55
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,380
to be equal to that
angle over there.

56
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,456
And we also know that
they are supplementary.

57
00:02:55,456 --> 00:03:01,676

58
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:02,800
Let me write it this way.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,550
They're congruent, and
they are supplementary.

60
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,950
These two are going to
have the same measure,

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,480
and they need to add
up to 180 degrees.

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,470
So if I have two things
that are the same thing

63
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,340
and they add up to 180 degrees,
what does that tell me?

64
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,850
So that tells me that
the measure of angle AEB

65
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,140
is equal to the measure
of angle CEB, which

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,730
must be equal to 90 degrees.

67
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,910
They're the same measure,
and they are supplementary.

68
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,710
So this is a right angle, and
then this is a right angle.

69
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,380
And obviously, if
this is a right angle,

70
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,890
this angle down here
is a vertical angle.

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,080
That's going to
be a right angle.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,550
If this is a right
angle, this over here

73
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,883
is going to be a vertical angle.

74
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:48,640
And you see the diagonals
intersect at a 90-degree angle.

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
So we've just proved--
so this is interesting.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,120
A parallelogram, the
diagonals bisect each other.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,350
For a rhombus, where
all the sides are equal,

78
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,610
we've shown that not only
do they bisect each other

79
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,840
but they're perpendicular
bisectors of each other.

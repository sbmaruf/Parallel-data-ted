Episode 7

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:22,089
Oh. We meet again.

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,859
Is she your girlfriend?

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,729
There's no way.

6
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,931
Of course.

7
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,466
Seung Jo, want to come have some tea at the cafe?

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:01:14,008
No. I'll go ahead first.

9
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,808
You're home?

10
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,878
Hey.

11
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,396
What?

12
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:25,475
That girl I saw in front of the classroom earlier...

13
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,287
Yoon Hae Ra?

14
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,122
Her name is Hae Ra?

15
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,333
Is she your senior?

16
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,325
Senior?

17
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,162
Does she look like someone above us?

18
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:39,433
Then again she is called the Goddess of the freshmen.

19
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,087
Goddess?

20
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,071
Wait, she's the same year as us?!

21
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,814
She entered as the second best in Parang University,

22
00:01:47,814 --> 00:01:50,993
And you were the top student in the whole school.

23
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:52,979
Someone so amazing...

24
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,242
Why did she come to our school?

25
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,414
Are you being jealous now?

26
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:01,812
No way! Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

27
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:04,909
Of course you would be,

28
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,002
After all, we did kiss.

29
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:12,473
Kiss?

30
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:20,007
<i> Ho! Perhaps, is this going to be the 2nd kiss?

31
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:39,044
This is just too good to be seen by myself.

32
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:43,473
I was played again.

33
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:51,256
To that person, the kiss we had that day meant nothing at all.

34
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:56,225
It was just a prank!

35
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:58,243
Come join us!

36
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:09,707
Please join our club!

37
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:18,054
So what? You're not really going out with Seung Jo.

38
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:21,024
Maybe you should just attack him.

39
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:24,707
What if he hates her even more.

40
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,014
That's hard.

41
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:29,073
It sure is.

42
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:32,341
Oh, my! I have to go.

43
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,352
You're not eating with us?

44
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:37,407
To be honest, I got a job.

45
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:38,207
A job?

46
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:41,173
Parang Beauty salon. The one In front of school.

47
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:43,044
Really?! That's great!

48
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:44,054
That's great.

49
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:47,673
I don't really know if it's really great or not.

50
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:51,094
They said I have to crawl up, but I'm trying it out.

51
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:59,373
So it seems it will be hard for me to keep having lunch with you guys. I've got to eat up lunch when there aren't any customers around.

52
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,014
You should come over too when you have time.

53
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:02,014
Yeah.

54
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,024
Then, I'll go off first.

55
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,373
I'm going. Bye.

56
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:07,607
Have fun!

57
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:11,084
Fighting!

58
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,039
I can't have lunch with you either.

59
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,173
Why?

60
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:20,073
The seniors from our major invited the freshmen to lunch.

61
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,004
Then do I have to eat alone?

62
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:26,481
Sorry.

63
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:33,507
Oh. I'm coming now.Yeah.

64
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,507
Go.

65
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,607
I'm sorry Ha Ni.

66
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,013
Sorry.

67
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:47,272
I'm going.

68
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:53,905
What's up with this?! I hate eating alone!

69
00:04:53,905 --> 00:05:00,847
Ah.

70
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:10,672
Seung Jo, did you eat lunch?

71
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:27,005
Seung Jo, do you perhaps have no one to eat lunch with?

72
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:34,105
I'll have chicken cutlet.

73
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:38,105
Wang Donkas, Chicken Cutlets, Hamburger steak...

74
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,296
You can't think if you don't say it out loud?

75
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,972
You came?

76
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:50,072
Even if you didn't, I was about to ask you if you wanted to have lunch together.

77
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,205
What are you going to eat? Donkas?

78
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:56,496
Hamburger steak please.

79
00:05:56,496 --> 00:05:59,772
Me too.

80
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:01,636
Can I get a lot of vegetables?

81
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:13,372
Me too.

82
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,105
Excuse me! Hasn't there been a mistake?

83
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:20,072
Yes?? What is the problem??

84
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:25,972
Hey, Mr. Prodigy, you sure are brave in going against my fair distribution of foods.

85
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:27,039
Bong Joon Gu?

86
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,305
Ha Ni! It's been a long time, right?

87
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,739
You, why are you here?

88
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,439
Weren't you working at my father's restaurant?

89
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,585
That's right. I work there in the evening, and here during the day.

90
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:44,205
I'm earning this much money, so you can come marry me any time you want!

91
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,539
I've prepared everything.

92
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:54,105
Knowing you're going to the same school as this jerk, you thought I would do nothing about it?

93
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:57,972
So Baek Seung Jo, how is it?

94
00:06:57,972 --> 00:06:59,739
You were really surprised, right?

95
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:02,972
Right. I was REALLY surprised!

96
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:06,397
How could you allow yourself to trail alongside the skirt of some girl?

97
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,672
The skirt of some girl?

98
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:12,172
That's called love, love.

99
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:13,372
You don't know what love is?

100
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,839
Hey!

101
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,139
Excuse me, please remake this.

102
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,672
Oh my, how come you only gave him half a serving?

103
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,872
Youngster Bong, is this how you're going to do your job?

104
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:28,039
Lady, this is more than enough for this fool!

105
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,639
Eat well.

106
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,405
Eat up Ha Ni!

107
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:37,639
This seat is empty ...

108
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:51,605
Hi!

109
00:07:51,605 --> 00:08:05,972
Ha Ni.

110
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:16,605
uhm... you go first

111
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:17,505
Omg, I finally found you all my life, I was waiting.

112
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:20,005
I've been looking forever!

113
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,139
Oh Sunbae, long time no see.

114
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,272
"Long time no see"?

115
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:28,005
Since you're the new student here, shouldn't you have been the one to look for me?

116
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:29,172
That saddens me.

117
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:29,939
Is that so?

118
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,939
"Is that so?" Look at this kid acting so gentle!

119
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:38,772
Well then, I'll get straight to the point. Have you joined any school club?

120
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:39,705
<i>School club?</i>

121
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:40,805
I haven't thought of that.

122
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:46,205
You can't just enter a club without thinking. Just forget about that, and come join our club.

123
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:49,739
If you're with us , we can go to Nationals this time.

124
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,139
Nationals?

125
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:54,172
I don't want to, and it's been a long time since I last played.

126
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:55,772
Yeah.

127
00:08:55,772 --> 00:09:03,472
Seung Jo, who was the person that got you the "Red Shoes" series when you were a sophomore?

128
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:10,805
-Don't remember? Then when you were a junior, who downloaded those really hot---Alright, alright.

129
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:13,505
You're saying okay? You're okay with it?

130
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,872
Thank you Seung Jo. You are such a nice boy.

131
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:19,405
After your classes are over, come find me in the club room, okay?

132
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:20,705
Yes.

133
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:27,305
Alright, then you better come later! I'll see you later, alright?!

134
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:34,005
School club?

135
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,139
Hi.

136
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,505
You don't have class?

137
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,805
You sure are following me all around.

138
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:45,505
What kind of club is it?

139
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,339
I won't tell you.

140
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,439
Why?

141
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:53,805
You're going to follow me if I do.

142
00:09:53,805 --> 00:10:02,075
Follow you? Who said I would follow you?

-So everyone is here.-This is the list of members.

Why isn't she coming?

Come.

150
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:38,212
So you followed me.

What is this? If I didn't follow then there would be trouble.

154
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,335
You play Tennis well?

155
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:03,771
I can't play it.

156
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:06,173
Of course I don't since I've never tried it before.

157
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,776
You shouldn't have come if you've never played.

158
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,677
You obviously think lightly of clubs.

159
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:15,035
What do you mean? That person said that I can join even if I can't play.

160
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,753
He said I just have to want to play and be sincere about it.

162

Today it seems to be a little awkward Since you still don't know each other,

168
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:41,175
I'm just going to do a brief intro, and we will begin our official training starting Thursday.

169
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,045
So you should bring along your rackets.

170
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:48,449
Pleased to meet you. I am the club vice-president, Wang Kyung Soo.

171
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:51,486
Second year student.

172
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:52,032
Second year?

173
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,032
Yeah.

174
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:54,955
21 years old.

175
00:12:54,955 --> 00:13:01,901
21 years old?!

176
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:04,732
I apologize. No. It's fine, it's fine.

177
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:11,706
Sometimes, even my mother talks to me formally,

178
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:17,278
Well it's good, since our beginning is light hearted and fun like this.

179
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,422
Then I will continue to get into the details.

180
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:32,793
This year our Top Spin club has been blessed with the entry of some very talented freshmen.

181
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:36,631
The winner of last year's high school tennis nationals.

182
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:49,177
First place, first place. Right, Baek Seung jo.

183
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:53,018
Also, she was in the same tournament,

184
00:13:53,018 --> 00:14:02,256
I present to you the girl's division winner. Yoon Hae Ra.

185
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:07,528
Nice to meet you all.

186
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:08,863
Ah!

187
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:17,671
I don't really know why, but as of last year, no new female students have joined our club.

188
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:26,716
However, a female student who cares greatly about our club and genuinely wants to join came today. Her name is...

189
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,683
Her nam...

190
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:30,685
It's Oh Ha Ni.

191
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:33,387
Oh Ha Ni.

192
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:37,324
Hello everyone. I am Oh Ha Ni from the social studies department.

193
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:43,023
Excuse me, but how long have you been playing Tennis?

194
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:47,761
I have never held a racket.

195
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,171
But I've played badminton!

196
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,139
Ah! Applause, applause.

197
00:14:52,139 --> 00:15:23,671


198
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:25,239
Are you okay?

199
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,307
Yeah I'm okay.

200
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:30,311
Yah, that was pretty powerful. You just need a little more practice and you'll be fine.

201
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:34,014
I'm sorry. I said it was okay, so keep playing.

202
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:37,518
Oh, Pretty! You look pretty.

203
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:38,252
For real?

204
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,854
Yeah, really pretty.

205
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,029
It's perfect! It's really pretty.

206
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:52,166
Oh you bought brand new clothes from head to toe.

207
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:58,839
Well, I have to go get ready...

208
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,345
"This is the first time in my life that I am playing tennis ," So you appear.

209
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:08,949
It's normally the kids that can't study that buy pencils before they even take an exam.

210
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,852
Right! And all different kinds.

211
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:15,522
By the way, you look to be getting along well with Kyung Soo Sunbae.

212
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:18,959
Yeah, I like Wang Sunbae.

213
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,761
He's exactly like Tofu.

214
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:21,562
Tofu?

215
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,023
Yeah.

216
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:28,936
He's smooth, and very kind. His words are very nice too.

217
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:31,939
Very different from a certain someone.

218
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:37,011
You're really clueless.

219
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:45,953
Let's go.

220
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:47,187
Okay, now.

221
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:50,324
Kyung Soo.

222
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:58,032
Since it's your first day, we're going to have an ability test. Go to the back and stay the way youare right now, and just get the balls.

223
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:02,403
Kyung Soo will be serving the balls.

224
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:04,805
Please don't feel burdened.

225
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:13,914
Today we will be testing to see what skill level everyone is. Don't be nervous. I'm going to serve 5 balls.

226
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:19,019
Don't force yourselves, and only do what you can. Don't over do it, or else, you can get hurt.

227
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,688
You play even when it's raining?

228
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,591
Of course, whether it's raining or snowing, we play.

229
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:49,025
So get ready everyone. We're going to start.

230
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:53,721
HEY!

231
00:17:53,721 --> 00:18:00,428
Hurry up and move it!

232
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,053
Those pieces of junk!

233
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,866
Electronics major, Han Ha Shik.

234
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:23,217
Fighting! Fighting!

235
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:27,955
Oh, startled me!

236
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:37,031
What the hell are you doing?! Hit the ball! The ball, damn it! Again.

237
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,166
Open your eyes WIDE!

238
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,802
Go!

239
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:43,104
What are you doing, punk?

240
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:44,572
Here!

241
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:47,174
At least get one you punks!

242
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:50,611
I told you to Get it!

243
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,018
Next.

244
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:56,717
Get it right! Get it RIGHT!

245
00:18:56,717 --> 00:19:00,921
Hit it correctly!

246
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:04,325
Hit it! Please hit it, damn it!

247
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:25,046
Undecided major, Yoon Hae Ra.

248
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:27,881
Sunbae, what are you doing?

249
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:50,371
Serve the ball correctly.

250
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,054
Next.

251
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,084
Undecided major, Baek Seung Jo.

252
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:58,007
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net</i>

253
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:01,507
Oh! Baek Seung Jo, nice to meet you.

254
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:04,607
I've been waiting for the day to go 1 on 1 with you, like this.

255
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:22,004
Please take care of me.

256
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:26,885
Hey, I've been going easy since you said you haven't played for awhile, but I don't think I need to.

257
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,607
No, please go easy on me.

258
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:32,326
That was just a coincidence.

259
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:49,044
Cocky fool.

260
00:20:49,044 --> 00:21:00,673
Okay, that's it.

261
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:08,024
Good job.

262
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:11,861
This isn't good, Wang Sunbae is totally pissed.

263
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,084
I know, the next person is dead now.

264
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:23,273
Last one, Oh Ha Ni.

265
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,585
Oh Ha Ni!

266
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,173
Where are you hiding? Come here.

267
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:28,004
Come here!

268
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:31,173
Go on over, he's calling you.

269
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:32,026
It's all your fault!

270
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:42,607
Come here quickly!

271
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:43,044
Excuse me...

272
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:44,074
Stand up straight!

273
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:48,073
I'm sorry, but this is the first time I'm playing in my entire life!

274
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,014
Please be gentle...

275
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:50,075
Shut up!

276
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:59,173
What's up with all the talk!

277
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:00,973
Are you playing dodgeball?

278
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:02,987
Why are you avoiding the balls!

279
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:05,273
Don't you dare avoid the balls again.

280
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:20,073
Don't you dare!

281
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,661
-Hey! Hey! Ha Ni! -Are you alright?

282
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,794
-I think she fainted!-Ha Ni get up!

283
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:25,794
She's got a bloody nose! It's a bloody nose!

284
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:29,194
That's right, this is what it's about!

285
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:33,294
This is the kind of will power I'm talking about! The need to hit the ball even if it means to faint!

286
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:34,661
That's right Oh Ha Ni!

287
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,527
Cheers!

288
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:43,561
Cheers!

289
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:45,727
Are you okay?

290
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:49,827
That fool is typically really well mannered, but once he picks up a racket he turns into a different person.

291
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,594
Really?

292
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:56,061
Yeah. He feels so bad he's not even able to come over here right now.

293
00:22:56,061 --> 00:23:01,437
You two, how the hell do both of you look so good, study so well, and even play tennis that great?

294
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:02,869
Isn't that just a bit too unfair?

295
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:07,683
You guys were really popular in high school too, right?

296
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:08,827
Not really.

297
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:11,794
Whatever, Hye Ra looks like she dated quite a lot.

298
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:14,927
I wasn't at all interested in dating.

299
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,361
Why?

300
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:21,161
Other people and I, have a hostile relationship, but I need other people.

301
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:26,994
Because I want to be acknowledged as independent through the mere independence of the other person.

302
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:30,761
And in so we begin to begin a process called dating.

303
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:36,194
And the meaning of independence here?

304
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:41,861
The ability to transcend all situations with my own will and ambition.

305
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:45,227
And when we respect the other person's independence...

306
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:48,227
That is Love.

307
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:52,927
That is what is said.

308
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:55,161
What? Does it hurt your head?

309
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,761
This is where it get's really important.

310
00:23:57,761 --> 00:24:00,061
Eventually ...

311
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:04,927
Eventually love is to throw away one's own independence, which becomes the posession of the other person.

312
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:09,061
The feelings that one feels at that point, is what's called hatred.

313
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:12,961
Therefore love can only fail.

314
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:15,527
What the hell is this?

315
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:16,427
My head hurts!

316
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,194
Are you interested in Sartre?

317
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:22,027
Not really Sartre, but I'm more interested in the relationship between Sartre and Beauvoir.

318
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,894
Oh Sartre and Beauvoir.

319
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:27,627
Even I know who they are.

320
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:31,494
Oh, now that I think about it, you two are simliar to them.

321
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:36,294
Didn't those two meet because they both placed 1st and 2nd place for the state exams?

322
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:53,561
That's right.

323
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,694
Really? That's crazy.

324
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,327
She's totally a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.

325
00:24:58,327 --> 00:24:59,027
Seriously.

326
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:02,161
You better be on your toes.

327
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:07,561
You followed your significant other to play tennis, which you have no clue about, and came back with a damaged nose.

328
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,894
What about it, Oh Ha Ni?

329
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:10,794
And here I thought you were on a roll this Spring, but look at you now.

330
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:14,727
Seriously, you went from winter back to winter.

331
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:18,194
No, there's still hope.

332
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:21,927
To be honest I do feel a bit uneasy about the club,

333
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:25,327
but there is still one area of hope left.

334
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:32,627
What is it?

335
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:37,661
You were here.

336
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,361
What a coincidence that we're in the same lecture?

337
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:43,027
What a relief, because I heard this lecture was hard.

338
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:44,094
Since you're here.

339
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:48,661
<i>This is it! Listening to a lecture along with Seung Jo.

340
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:51,227
<i>I could have never imagined this in high school.

341
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:58,794
<i>I knew it! Oh Ha Ni's spring has arrived!

342
00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:01,227
The guy sitting behind you came along too?

343
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,961
Huh?

344
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,661
Ha Ni!

345
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:05,994
What are you doing here?

346
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:08,194
What is it? Can I not be here?

347
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:10,561
I just really miss the old days of studying!

348
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:13,127
Did you like to study so much that you miss it?

349
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:17,727
Fool, it's because of you that I got out of the cafeteria during it's busiest hours!

350
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:20,127
Was the cafeteria that slow?

351
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:23,194
Of course I feel bad towards the cafeteria lady.

352
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,527
But it can't be helped!

353
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:30,627
Is that seat taken?

354
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:45,161
What a real coincidence? We're sitting in another lecture together.

355
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:50,227
What do you usually eat for breakfast?

356
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:52,961
I really don't know.

357
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:55,094
Ha Ni!Ha Ni!

358
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:56,794
Do you understand?

359
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:58,561
Joon Gu, shhh!

360
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,161
Pardon me.

361
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:01,797
Oh.

362
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:03,594
Why do you have a bandaid on?

363
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:04,561
Did you hurt yourself?

364
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:05,927
Huh?

365
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:12,553
Me?

366
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:19,285
What did he say?

367
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:22,252
I am sorry.

368
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:24,252
I'm be quiet!

369
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:26,089
Oh, shut the mouth!

370
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,752
Shut the mouth?

371
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:32,118
What, why are you guys laughing!? She's doing good!

372
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:36,885
And... who are you?

373
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,085
Me?

374
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:39,553
Me?

375
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:45,285
You don't have any books. Did you originally take this class or...?

376
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:50,985
Oh. What? Huh?

377
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,152
Hey man!

378
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:55,452
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:57,152
But I am coding!

380
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:59,018
Yes I'm coding!

381
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,385
Coding?

382
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:03,052
What does that mean?

383
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:04,685
Are you trying to say you're a high school student?

384
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,818
Not that, but that I just have a high school diploma.

385
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:11,085
That I don't attend this school.

386
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,718
He doesn't go to school here.

387
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,985
He just works at the school cafeteria.

388
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,618
I guess...

389
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:18,018
He likes Ha Ni.

390
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:19,552
That's why, he's here.

391
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:21,418
Oh. I see.

392
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:23,785
What the hell is this hag talking about? What did you say?

393
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,885
Hey, why are you acting so high and mighty when I didn't even ask you to!?

394
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:31,085
Everyone is sitting here after paying the expensive tuition.

395
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,252
Stop being a nuisance and why don't you just leave now?

396
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:36,452
What? A nuisance?!

397
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:39,552
If you're stupid, the least you could be is modest.

398
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,585
Gosh, I absolutely hate stupid guys.

399
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:53,718
You're like a bug!

400
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:59,318
You don't have class today?

401
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:01,518
After going to university...

402
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:03,885
It really is no joke.

403
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:06,401
What? Did something happen?

404
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:09,745
That's not it...

405
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:12,389
I think there are so many kids that are super smart

406
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:16,364
and super pretty.

407
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:20,989
Seung Jo as well, probably likes the pretty,

408
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:24,789
smart, and skinny ones.

409
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,156
He probably likes girls like that right?

410
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,423
Hey!

411
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:36,156
Did a girl like that appear before him?!

412
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:38,423
Hey, Ha Ni.

413
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:43,089
I may look this young, but I am an adult.

414
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,489
I can tell just looking at you two.

415
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:49,192
You two can only be perfect when together.

416
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:50,074
Huh?

417
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:54,489
You're meant to be.

418
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,556
Like this.

419
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,523
I don't know how great that girl may be,

420
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:02,255
but it can't be helped if she's not his other half.

421
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:04,423
See?

422
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:09,123
See, it can't be helped if it doesn't fit.

423
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:13,389
So don't you worry. Alright?

424
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:14,223
Yes.

425
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:17,023
That's right.

426
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:26,951
Now stop wiping that, you're going to put a hole in it!

427
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:27,987
Oh. Baek Eun Jo.

428
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:30,556
What is it?

429
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:32,623
Your caligraphy supplies?

430
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,723
Yeah. The ink stone...

431
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:42,889
And rice paper?

432
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:46,078
What are you looking at that you don't even hear me when I call?

433
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:49,038
Oh. What is it, Oh Ha Ni?

434
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,008
Why did you come to someone else's school?

435
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:52,058
Uhjjoo (Look at you)!

436
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,913
I brought your materials...

437
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:55,947
I'm going to take it back.

438
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,413
Ah give it to me.

439
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:06,018
What are you watching?

440
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,747
I got it.

441
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:09,028
It's her.

442
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:10,647
Am I right?

443
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:14,008
Ohh. She's pretty.

444
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,913
Actually, they're all prettier than you.

445
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:26,513
This...

446
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:27,447
Here.

447
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:57,313
Thank you!

448
00:31:57,313 --> 00:32:22,713
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

449
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:24,028
I don't want to do this anymore.

450
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,447
Ah. Is that so?

451
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,013
Then, eat this

452
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:30,613
I'll get fat!

453
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:32,913
Where do you have fat?

454
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:35,613
Then do you want to play Omok (Korean game)?

455
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:40,913
Boring...

456
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:50,513
Ah, he has to make her have fun.

457
00:32:50,513 --> 00:32:53,347
I want to leave.

458
00:32:53,347 --> 00:33:01,038
My mom's making some food.

459
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,018
Hyung!

460
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:05,088
Is this your friend?

461
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:07,847
Yes.

462
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,913
Oh, you did a good job making this.

463
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:13,613
Eun Jo's pretty smart.

464
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:23,018
This

465
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:26,313
Like this.

466
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:28,447
Wow.

467
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:41,847
Could I stay for dinner?

468
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,213
Sarah, should I give you more?

469
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:45,147
No thank you. I ate well.

470
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:52,013
Aigoo, so clever.

471
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,028
Seung Jo, oppa!

472
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:53,813
Huh?

473
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:58,047
Oppa, do you believe in love at first sight?

474
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:00,547
Hmm, I'm not sure. I never thought about it.

475
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:02,078
I used to not believe it.

476
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:05,913
I thought adults were just saying things,

477
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:10,113
but i think it's real.

478
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:13,113
Earlier, when you came into the room,

479
00:34:13,113 --> 00:34:17,038
the background behind Oppa really became white and

480
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:25,113
I couldn't see anyone but oppa.

481
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:39,413
Oppa, just wait 7 years.

482
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:43,058
Eun Jo, you... since Sarah likes your hyung

483
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:46,078
are you here because you're sad?

484
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:53,018
Our Eun Jo is so cool though,right?

485
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,647
Eun Jo ahh.

486
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,513
I don't know.

487
00:34:56,513 --> 00:35:40,913
Aigoo what's wrong? Eun Jo, you're cool too!

488
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,847
Ah. Where's Eun Jo?

489
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,747
Are you even worried?

490
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:48,947
What? Why are you being like that to me?

491
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,047
Cheater (relationship-wise).

492
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:50,068
What?

493
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:55,447
You act like you're not, while you're managing(?) it. I see it all.

494
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,088
Manage?

495
00:35:56,088 --> 00:36:01,018
Yeah. Manage.

496
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:05,413
Whenever I want to throw away my feelings because I think it just must not be,

497
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,547
you laugh for me once in awhile.

498
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:11,013
Whether it's real or you're playing around,

499
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,647
you make people confused and make them dumb.

500
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:16,913
What are you talking about?

501
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:20,447
You're right. You did well.

502
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:23,008
You two look good together. Mean.

503
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:26,547
Hey, are you talking about Yoon Hae Ra right now?

504
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:28,247
Not talking about Eun Jo?

505
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:36,038
Ah, it's the same thing.

506
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:55,038
How did it go?

507
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:56,068
Go away, Oh Ha Ni!

508
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:59,613
I don't want to see you! It's all your fault!

509
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:01,947
Just go!

510
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:04,647
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:06,913
You brought her here and it ended up like this.

512
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:08,058
Did I ask you for that favor?

513
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:12,313
You're right. I went overboard again.

514
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:16,947
Well, that's just like me.

515
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:19,213
I'm really sorry.

516
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:21,647
I know that I can't say anything to make you feel better...

517
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:23,013
What do you know?

518
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:30,913
What do you know?

519
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:33,058
I know.

520
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:37,813
In this world, I probably know it the best.

521
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:45,713
The person I like doesn't look at me but looks at someone else. Smiles/laughs for someone else.

522
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:49,088
I really know what that feels like.

523
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:52,068
And I can't be truthfully jealous either.

524
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:59,147
Are you talking about my brother?

525
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,947
Eun Jo.

526
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:06,513
I think... if two people mutually like each other...

527
00:38:06,513 --> 00:38:10,018
It's almost a miracle.

528
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:15,347
Someday, will that miracle come true for me too?

529
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:20,038
I don't know.

530
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:23,008
Don't do that.

531
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:42,713
Stop it.

532
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:51,058
Should I get another house?

533
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:54,058
Chef. Chef. Take a look at this.

534
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:57,713
Okay.

535
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:01,347
Hey hey, why is this so watery?

536
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:05,913
When you made the dough... Did you mix in one direction?

537
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:08,613
Ah that's right. I did it that way.

538
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,513
Aigoo.

539
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:12,947
Oh?

540
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:15,038
The seasoning is good.

541
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:18,447
Yes. But it's really interesting!

542
00:39:18,447 --> 00:39:21,547
How can it have that salty taste?

543
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:24,847
Yet it also tastes sweet!

544
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,038
Ah. That's right.

545
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:31,813
If you leave it for a couple hours, you don't need to add MSG.

546
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:34,813
Someone will hear. The way...

547
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:37,713
Hey, go make the batter again.

548
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:39,713
Oh, then what should I do with this?

549
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:43,018
In the refridgerator, there should be batter. Mix this with both halves of that.

550
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:47,213
Yes. I understand.

551
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:50,313
Here.

552
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:53,647
When am I going to make noodles out of this.

553
00:39:53,647 --> 00:40:02,113
i need to hurry up and make a bowl for Ha Ni to eat.

554
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,347
Joon Gu.

555
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:04,313
Yes. Chef.

556
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:08,447
What do you like about Ha Ni?

557
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,447
Oh. Chef.

558
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:17,447
Since you ask me like that, I'm a little embarrassed.

559
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:21,028
If it wasn't for Ha Ni, I wouldn't have been able to graduate.

560
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:26,028
I used to get in trouble everyday and the kids used to avoid me.

561
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:30,058
Ha Ni became my friend, and I was able to graduate.

562
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:32,747
Ah. Is that so?

563
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:35,247
Yes. Chef.

564
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,513
This is correct, right?

565
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:50,708
Like this, like this.

566
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:55,877
So it is true that you live under one roof.

567
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:56,799
Hyung.

568
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,913
Oh. Eun Jo.

569
00:40:58,913 --> 00:41:03,074
We've got to look for some documents for a joint assignment.

570
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:07,501
I'm sorry, but do you think you could take your work to the study?

571
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,741
What kind of assignment?

572
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:16,257
It's a general ed class based on Western studies, but we had to partner up and complete the assignment.

573
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:17,158
Your brother?

574
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:19,089
Yes. Eun Jo.

575
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:24,663
Hello.

576
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:35,119
Come on.

577
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:56,056
She's so pretty.

578
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,878
Seems like none of the adults are home?

579
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:09,484
Yeah, father is late all the time and it seems mother has gone out.

580
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:12,156
What are we going to do about the assignment?

581
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:13,464
Do you know a bit about Nietzsche?

582
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,757
I've read some of his works,

583
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:18,054
but I don't know if I could say I know it.

584
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:19,958
Then again...

585
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:44,084
It's Nietzsche, do you think that's what I meant?

586
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:48,197
Oh it's nice here!

587
00:42:48,197 --> 00:43:00,893
The view is so much better!

588
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:05,616
I hear Western guys think that when a girl innocently follows them home,

589
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:11,207
it means that the girl is okay with spending the night with the guy.

590
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:12,907
What should we do?

591
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:18,078
Let's each organize the documents and then make a conclusion.

592
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,727
Sounds good.

593
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:41,646
Since we can't look at all of them in this short amount of time.

594
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:44,065
What's our theme going to be?

595
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:51,022
Nietzsche may have said God is dead, but in the end he wasn't denying God but praising him.

596
00:43:51,022 --> 00:43:53,013
What do you think is the core of Nietzsche's words?

597
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:55,007
Well...

598
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,607
The word joy keeps coming to mind.Hwan Hee = Joy

599
00:43:57,607 --> 00:43:59,173
What?!

600
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:01,173
Did he say Ha Ni?

601
00:44:01,173 --> 00:44:03,959
Joy.

602
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,074
That's a good one!

603
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:08,407
Overcoming denial and changing into joy!

604
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:12,407
How about we turn in a video file instead of a report.

605
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:13,273
A video?

606
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,907
Like using clay animation or something.

607
00:44:15,907 --> 00:44:19,107
We can show the process of extinction to formation.

608
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:23,407
So we'll show the notion of joy via a video file.

609
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:28,673
You have a camera at home right?

610
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:30,094
You're home?

611
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:32,054
I'm going to use the camera.

612
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:33,407
Camera?!

613
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,084
Hyung is working on an assignment with a friend.

614
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:37,912
It's a 2 person assignment.

615
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:38,773
Really?!

616
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:41,064
But the friend he came with is a girl.

617
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:43,064
She's so pretty.

618
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:45,207
What?

619
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:45,084
A girl?

620
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:46,707
Yes.

621
00:44:46,707 --> 00:44:50,007
The professor assigned the partners, so don't be mistaken.

622
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:51,084
I'm going to use this. I'll put it back after I'm done.

623
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:55,407
Eun Jo, I need something from some of your supplies.

624
00:44:55,407 --> 00:45:06,034
I'm going to use it.

625
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:07,004
Goodnight, Father.

626
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,707
Alright. Don't leave the door open because you have to go somewhere or anything.

627
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,064
Don't worry!

628
00:45:10,064 --> 00:45:12,407
-Goodnight!-Thank you!

629
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:24,982
-Thank you for the hard work!-Good luck!

630
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:27,773
Others have all gone to university.

631
00:45:27,773 --> 00:45:31,207
They're doing well with clubs and listening to lectures.

632
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:33,307
Bong Joon Gu.

633
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:37,073
You're so pathetic.

634
00:45:37,073 --> 00:45:39,107
But what can you do.

635
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,129
Hurry and learn the trade and become a top chef,

636
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:57,073
so you can proudly propose to Ha Ni.

637
00:45:57,073 --> 00:46:03,107
Ha Ni, what are you doing right now?

638
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,014
Should I call her?

639
00:46:05,014 --> 00:46:10,573
I've never called her this late.

640
00:46:10,573 --> 00:46:38,773
Man, now that I'm going to call her, it's a bit nerve wrecking.

641
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:39,507
Pretty good.

642
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:45,073
It's unfortunate I can't be a bit more detailed, but this isn't an art project so...

643
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:48,084
Let's film it.

644
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:51,054
Seung Jo can you spread out the petals?

645
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:52,573
Like this?

646
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:59,707
Yes

647
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:01,407
Your mother?

648
00:47:01,407 --> 00:47:03,907
She's my friend.

649
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,094
Hello.

650
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:08,807
Yes. So you're working on an assignment together?

651
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:10,307
Yes

652
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:13,407
We should have asked permission before hand.

653
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,064
Barging in without contacting you...

654
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,094
I'm sorry.

655
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:21,007
Yes.

656
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:22,007
Where is Ha Ni?

657
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:31,084
Probably in her room.

658
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:34,373
Where did she go?

659
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:37,807
I heard she came home.

660
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:42,473
Oh. She left her handphone.

661
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:44,084
Ha Ni isn't in her room.

662
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:46,207
Is that so?

663
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:57,473
She must have gone some where.

664
00:47:57,473 --> 00:47:59,173
Ha Ni.

665
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:07,034
Ha Ni.

666
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:11,707
Oh, what's this?

667
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:19,054
It's awesome once something living is on it.

668
00:48:19,054 --> 00:48:25,004
Oh it is.

669
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:29,673
Where did this guy come from?

670
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:33,407
<i>It's the first time I've seen him so happy.</i>

671
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,807
Is Seung Jo...

672
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:40,107
Having a taste of joy right now?

673
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:42,807
It's done.

674
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:45,024
Do you think you can grab me a glass of water?

675
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:48,073
Oh then again we haven't had anything to eat this whole time.

676
00:48:48,073 --> 00:49:08,507
Hold on a second.

677
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:11,107
<I>What should I do?

678
00:49:11,107 --> 00:49:12,973
<I>Should I jump down?

679
00:49:12,973 --> 00:49:15,084
<i>If she sees me here,

680
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:22,094
<i>I'm better off dying!

681
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:25,207
Yes.

682
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:28,004
No I'm out.

683
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:32,054
I'm at a friend's house because of a school assignment.

684
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:35,173
We're done.

685
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:48,273
I'll call once I leave.

686
00:49:48,273 --> 00:50:06,403
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net

687
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:09,077
You should quickly be able to play on the courts.

688
00:50:09,077 --> 00:50:14,794
You can't just shag balls everyday until graduation.

689
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,937
But still, you're trying your best.

690
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:19,037
Even when Seung Jo is not here, you still come.

691
00:50:19,037 --> 00:50:21,237
Why isn't he coming?

692
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:25,041
Omo, you didn't know?

693
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:31,097
Seung Jo is a special member. He joined the club on the condition to come and play whenever he feels like it.

694
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:38,316
You're living together, but you don't even know about that?

695
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:40,459
Wait a moment.

696
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:47,137
So your relationship is at that level?

697
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:49,137
Great.

698
00:50:49,137 --> 00:51:05,337
Not getting anxious... is a little boring.

699
00:51:05,337 --> 00:51:08,303
She's so mature.

700
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:14,703
We're the same age, but why do I seem like a kid?

701
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:20,785
Baek Seung Jo can come when he feels like it?

702
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:23,103
Then why did I join here?

703
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:33,017
Why I am gathering those?

704
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:37,047
Oh, dad.

705
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:40,077
What?

706
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:42,237
It's going to be spicy.

707
00:51:42,237 --> 00:51:47,237
I like it spicy.

708
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,903
Tennis?

709
00:51:49,903 --> 00:51:52,603
Is it fun?

710
00:51:52,603 --> 00:51:54,937
It's hard...

711
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:57,737
Really?

712
00:51:57,737 --> 00:52:00,345
Why did you call me?

713
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:05,937
Put a little bit more radish juice in it.

714
00:52:05,937 --> 00:52:08,603
I asked you why you called me!

715
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:11,087
Yeah.

716
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:18,007
Let's move out.

717
00:52:18,007 --> 00:52:22,437
In the end, we can't just keep living there forever.

718
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:25,737
But...<Br><Br> However I'm...

719
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:29,503
usually out here because I'm working, but

720
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:36,903
It seems like you're having a real hard time so my heart is unsettled.

721
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,007
Let's move out.

722
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:59,097
I'll take care of a place for us to temporarily reside at.

723
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:01,937
Ar... Are you alright?

724
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:04,087
Oh, it's spicy.

725
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:09,376
I might have put too much horseradish

726
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:13,637
I'm starting to tear up.

727
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:24,017
So, why did you put a lot?

728
00:53:24,017 --> 00:53:27,087
I'm against it. Thinking that Ha Ni will be gone!

729
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:29,837
I don't want to. I'm against this.

730
00:53:29,837 --> 00:53:32,003
Honey, be a little thoughtful.

731
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:35,237
He's saying that Ha Ni will go away!

732
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:36,087
Ah... Really.

733
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:43,503
Ki Dong, you really don't have to be concerned about it. We really want you to live with us.

734
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:50,303
It's not like you're just staying here for nothing, you're paying the monthly rent.<Br><Br> Thanks for the offer but we've been here too long.

735
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:53,077
We've been bothering Seung Jo and Eun Jo.

736
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:56,637
And our Ha Ni,

737
00:53:56,637 --> 00:54:00,537
Will be able to give up Seung Jo quickly. About that...

738
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,067
How can I?

739
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:03,037
It's alright, Jae Su-Shi

740
00:54:03,037 --> 00:54:05,027
No, it's not.

741
00:54:05,027 --> 00:54:08,903
Anyhow, this problem should be dealt with by the the 2 who are concerned.

742
00:54:08,903 --> 00:54:17,536
Seung Jo doesn't have any interest in Ha Ni, and... What should I do?!

743
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:24,067
If Ha Ni marries into our family that won't be a problem anymore right?

744
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:28,737
Oh, I really love that bright personality

745
00:54:28,737 --> 00:54:32,903
And that cuteness of hers.

746
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:37,503
Even Seung Jo, will come to like her .

747
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:42,737
Aigoo! Our Ha...Ha Ni

748
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,303
Is a happy child.

749
00:54:45,303 --> 00:54:48,077
for you adoring her like this.

750
00:54:48,077 --> 00:55:10,637
Stop crying already.

751
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:12,503
Hyung.

752
00:55:12,503 --> 00:55:15,803
Oh Ha Ni is moving out.

753
00:55:15,803 --> 00:55:21,603
She's moving back with her father to their house.

754
00:55:21,603 --> 00:55:23,503
Isn't that great?

755
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:47,503
Ever since she moved in, she has only been a pain to you and me.

756
00:55:47,503 --> 00:55:49,537
You're moving out?

757
00:55:49,537 --> 00:55:52,101
Yeah...

758
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:53,237
Are you disappointed?

759
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:59,087
Well, it's a relief since my life can finally go back to normal.

760
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:02,566
Right.

761
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:07,237
Yea...That's what I hope too.

762
00:56:07,237 --> 00:56:18,103
I have to go pack now.

763
00:56:18,103 --> 00:59:13,003
Goodnight.

764
00:59:13,003 --> 00:59:24,137
Ha Ni we have to go now. They're all waiting downstairs.

765
00:59:24,137 --> 00:59:29,047
Is that all?

766
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:56,937
Dad...

767
00:59:56,937 --> 01:00:00,003
Jae Su-Shi.

768
01:00:00,003 --> 01:00:02,503
Aigoo

769
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:05,703
Seung Jo, Eun Jo.

770
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:11,903
We've brought you much trouble. Really sorry.

771
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,903
Oh right.

772
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:18,137
You should come by our house sometimes.

773
01:00:18,137 --> 01:00:23,047
Ha Ni, say goodbye.

774
01:00:23,047 --> 01:00:35,403
For taking care of us, I'm very grateful.

775
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:40,603
For making delicious meals everyday,

776
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:49,303
On the day of the sports competition, you brought us Pizza and took pictures with us. Even taking my friends with me

777
01:00:49,303 --> 01:00:51,837
And even took my friends with us to the beach.

778
01:00:51,837 --> 01:00:56,007
and threw me a congratulation party for passing the exam.

779
01:00:56,007 --> 01:01:04,403
To me everything is a pleasant memory.

780
01:01:04,403 --> 01:01:12,037
Everything that happened when I lived here, really...

781
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:16,017
Ha Ni...

782
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:28,037
I'm sorry for being a bother to you this far.

783
01:01:28,037 --> 01:01:32,007
Ha Ni...

784
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:36,903
Mother!

785
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:46,403
My life with you....

786
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:53,937
If you're like this then it'll make Ha Ni awkward.

787
01:01:53,937 --> 01:01:55,437
Stay well.

788
01:01:55,437 --> 01:01:57,808
Okay.

789
01:01:57,808 --> 01:02:04,437
Come back and visit.

790
01:02:04,437 --> 01:02:06,057
Ha Ni, let's go now.

01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:13,067
Yes...

792

Good bye.

793
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:37,941
Well, then.

794
01:02:37,941 --> 01:02:51,003
Put on your seat belt.

795
01:02:51,003 --> 01:02:59,067
Ha Ni...

796
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,077
Assa! Now I can have my room back.

797
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:04,703
Baek Eun Jo, You!

798
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,027
Mother! Aren't you going to feed us?

799
01:03:07,027 --> 01:04:04,512
This is all your fault, Seung Jo.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,637

2
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:02,970
Let's do a little bit of
probability with playing cards.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,511
And for the sake of
this video, we're

4
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:06,864
going to assume that our
deck has no jokers in it.

5
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:08,780
You could do the same
problems with the joker,

6
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,560
you'll just get slightly
different numbers.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,390
So with that out of
the way, let's first

8
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,800
just think about
how many cards we

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,210
have in a standard playing deck.

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,040
So you have four
suits, and the suits

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,960
are the spades, the diamonds,
the clubs, and the hearts.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,770
You have four suits and
then in each of those suits

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,950
you have 13 different
types of cards--

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,640
and sometimes it's
called the rank.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:43,970

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,920
You have the ace, then you have
the two, the three, the four,

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,210
the five, the six,
seven, eight, nine, ten,

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,620
and then you have the Jack,
the King, and the Queen.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,590
And that is 13 cards.

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,890
So for each suit
you can have any

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,480
of these-- you can
have any of the suits.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,910
So you could have a Jack of
diamonds, a Jack of clubs,

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,220
a Jack of spades,
or a Jack of hearts.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,970
So if you just multiply
these two things--

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,532
you could take a deck of playing
cards, take out the jokers

26
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,240
and count them-- but
if you just multiply

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,740
this you have four suits, each
of those suits have 13 types.

28
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,120
So you're going to
have 4 times 13 cards,

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,207
or you're going to have 52 cards
in a standard playing deck.

30
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:25,790
Another way you could
have said, look,

31
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,270
there's 13 of these
ranks, or types,

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,120
and each of those come in four
different suits-- 13 times 4.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,237
Once again, you would
have gotten 52 cards.

34
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:34,820
Now, with that of
the way, let's think

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,156
about the probabilities
of different events.

36
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:38,530
So let's say I
shuffle that deck.

37
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,610
I shuffle it really,
really well and then

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,240
I randomly pick a
card from that deck.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,400
And I want to think about
what is the probability that I

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,220
pick a Jack.

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,450
Well, how many equally
likely events are there?

42
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,540
Well, I could pick any
one of those 52 cards.

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,350
So there's 52 possibilities
for when I pick that card.

44
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,130
And how many of those 52
possibilities are Jacks?

45
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,480
Well you have the Jack of
spades, the Jack of diamonds,

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,880
the Jack of clubs, and
the Jack of hearts.

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,170
There's four Jacks in that deck.

48
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,090
So it is 4 over 52-- these
are both divisible by 4-- 4

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,060
divided by 4 is 1, 52
divided by 4 is 13.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,390
Now, let's think
about the probability.

51
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,976
So I'll start over.

52
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm going to put that
Jack back and I'm

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,850
going to reshuffle the deck.

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,020
So once again, I
still have 52 cards.

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,290
So what's the probability
that I get a hearts?

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,290
What's the probability
that I just randomly pick

57
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,720
a card from a shuffled
deck and it is a heart?

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,580
Well, once again,
there's 52 possible cards

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,480
I could pick from.

60
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,720
52 possible, equally likely
events that we're dealing with.

61
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,010
And how many of those
have our hearts?

62
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,770
Well, essentially 13
of them are hearts.

63
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,180
For each of those suits
you have 13 types.

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,892
So there are 13
hearts in that deck.

65
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:03,350
There are 13 diamonds
in that deck.

66
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,970
There are 13 spades
in that deck.

67
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,490
There are 13 clubs in that deck.

68
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,570
So 13 of the 52 would result
in hearts, and both of these

69
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,270
are divisible by 13.

70
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,670
This is the same thing as 1/4.

71
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,040
One in four times
I will pick it out,

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,690
or I have a one in four
probability of getting a hearts

73
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,619
when I randomly pick a card
from that shuffled deck.

74
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:27,160
Now, let's do something that's
a little bit more interesting,

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,250
or maybe it's a little obvious.

76
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,130
What's the probability
that I pick something

77
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,540
that is a Jack-- I'll just
write J-- and it is a hearts?

78
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,120

79
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,230
Well, if you are reasonably
familiar with cards

80
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,605
you'll know that
there's actually

81
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,900
only one card that is
both a Jack and a heart.

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,520
It is literally
the Jack of hearts.

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,530
So we're saying, what
is the probability

84
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,870
that we pick the exact
card, the Jack of hearts?

85
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,200
Well, there's only
one event, one card,

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,660
that meets this criteria
right over here,

87
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,630
and there's 52 possible cards.

88
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,630
So there's a one
in 52 chance that I

89
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,650
pick the Jack of hearts--
something that is both a Jack

90
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,710
and it's a heart.

91
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,640
Now, let's do something a
little bit more interesting.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,434
What is the
probability-- you might

93
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,600
want to pause this and think
about this a little bit

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,808
before I give you the answer.

95
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:20,019
What is the probability
of-- so I once again, I

96
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,340
have a deck of 52
cards, I shuffled it,

97
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,350
randomly pick a card from that
deck-- what is the probability

98
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,420
that that card that I pick from
that deck is a Jack or a heart?

99
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,050
So it could be the
Jack of hearts,

100
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,414
or it could be the
Jack of diamonds,

101
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:36,830
or it could be the
Jack of spades,

102
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,450
or it could be the
Queen of hearts,

103
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,872
or it could be
the two of hearts.

104
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:41,330
So what is the
probability of this?

105
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,579
And this is a little bit
more of an interesting thing,

106
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:46,440
because we know, first
of all, that there

107
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,912
are 52 possibilities.

108
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,370
But how many of
those possibilities

109
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,010
meet these conditions that
it is a Jack or a heart.

110
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,080
And to understand that,
I'll draw a Venn diagram.

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,650
Sounds kind of fancy,
but nothing fancy here.

112
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,740
So imagine that this
rectangle I'm drawing here

113
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,820
represents all of the outcomes.

114
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,770
So if you want, you could
imagine it has an area of 52.

115
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,730
So this is 52 possible outcomes.

116
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,730
Now, how many of those
outcomes result in a Jack?

117
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,860
So we already learned, one out
of 13 of those outcomes result

118
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
in a Jack.

119
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,490
So I could draw a
little circle here,

120
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,290
where that area-- and I'm
approximating-- represents

121
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,520
the probability of a Jack.

122
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,770
So it should be
roughly 1/13, or 4/52,

123
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,460
of this area right over here.

124
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,060
So I'll just draw it like this.

125
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,505
So this right over here is
the probability of a Jack.

126
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:44,310

127
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,660
There's four possible
cards out of the 52.

128
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,560
So that is 4/52,
or one out of 13.

129
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,270

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,470
Now, what's the probability
of getting a hearts?

131
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,540
Well, I'll draw another
little circle here

132
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,530
that represents that.

133
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,540
13 out of 52 cards
represent a heart.

134
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,880
And actually, one of those
represents both a heart

135
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,920
and a Jack.

136
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,060
So I'm actually going
to overlap them,

137
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,870
and hopefully this will
make sense in a second.

138
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,010
So there's actually 13
cards that are a heart.

139
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,530
So this is the number of hearts.

140
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,180

141
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,110
And actually, let me write this
top thing that way as well.

142
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,380
It makes it a little bit
clearer that we're actually

143
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,320
looking at the number of Jacks.

144
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,390

145
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,210
And of course,
this overlap right

146
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,920
here is the number of Jacks
and hearts-- the number

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,470
of items out of this 52 that
are both a Jack and a heart--

148
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,160
it is in both sets here.

149
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,810
It is in this green circle and
it is in this orange circle.

150
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,500
So this right over here--
let me do that in yellow

151
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,600
since I did that problem in
yellow-- this right over here

152
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,210
is a number of Jacks and hearts.

153
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,710
So let me draw a
little arrow there.

154
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,590
It's getting a little
cluttered, maybe

155
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,325
I should draw a little
bit bigger number.

156
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:11,040

157
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,960
And that's an
overlap over there.

158
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,670
So what is the probability
of getting a Jack or a heart?

159
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,450
So if you think about
it, the probability

160
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,260
is going to be the
number of events

161
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,977
that meet these conditions,
over the total number events.

162
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,060
We already know the total
number of events are 52.

163
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,040
But how many meet
these conditions?

164
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,950
So it's going to be the
number-- you could say,

165
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,110
well, look at the green
circle right there says

166
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,580
the number that gives us a Jack,
and the orange circle tells us

167
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
the number that
gives us a heart.

168
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,100
So you might want to say,
well, why don't we add up

169
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,800
the green and the
orange, but if you

170
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,047
did that, you would
be double counting,

171
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,630
Because if you add
it up-- if you just

172
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,580
did four plus 13--
what are we saying?

173
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,980
We're saying that
there are four Jacks

174
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,170
and we're saying that
there are 13 hearts.

175
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,230
But in both of these, when we
do it this way, in both cases

176
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,239
we are counting
the Jack of hearts.

177
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,780
We're putting the
Jack of hearts here

178
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,370
and we're putting the
Jack of hearts here.

179
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,869
So we're counting
the Jack of hearts

180
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,890
twice, even though there's
only one card there.

181
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,090
So you would have to subtract
out where they're common.

182
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,090
You would have to
subtract out the item that

183
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,390
is both a Jack and a heart.

184
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,990
So you would subtract out a 1.

185
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,800
Another way to
think about it is,

186
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,130
you really want to figure
out the total area here.

187
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,919

188
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,590
And let me zoom in-- and I'll
generalize it a little bit.

189
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,090
So if you have one
circle like that,

190
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,030
and then you have another
overlapping circle like that,

191
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,730
and you wanted to figure
out the total area of both

192
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,700
of these circles
combined, you would

193
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,260
look at the area of this circle.

194
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,340

195
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,730
And then you could add it
to the area of this circle.

196
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,530
But when you do that, you'll
see that when you add the two

197
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,270
areas, you're counting
this area twice.

198
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,270
So in order to only
count that area once,

199
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,510
you have to subtract
that area from the sum.

200
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,200
So if this area has
A, this area is B,

201
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,830
and the intersection
where they overlap is C,

202
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,370
the combined area is
going to be A plus B-- --

203
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,492
minus where they
overlap-- minus C.

204
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:24,950
So that's the same
thing over here,

205
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,874
we're counting all
the Jacks, and that

206
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:28,040
includes the Jack of hearts.

207
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,664
We're counting all
the hearts, and that

208
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,230
includes the Jack of hearts.

209
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,250
So we counted the
Jack of hearts twice,

210
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,260
so we have to subtract
1 out of that.

211
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,640
This is going to be
4 plus 13 minus 1,

212
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,284
or this is going to be 16/52.

213
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:42,850

214
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,250
And both of these things
are divisible by 4.

215
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,890
So this is going to be the
same thing as, divide 16 by 4,

216
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,670
you get 4.

217
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,330
52 divided by 4 is 13.

218
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:01,460
So there's a 4/13 chance that
you'd get a Jack or a hearts.

1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,410
Rewrite 5 plus 5 plus 5 plus
5 plus 5 plus 5 plus 5 as a

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,440
multiplication expression.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,120
And then they want us to write
the expression three times

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,260
using different ways to
write multiplication.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,610
So let's do the first part.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,390
Let's write it as a
multiplication expression.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,945
So how many times have
we added 5 here?

8
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:23,660
Well, we've got it at
one, two, three,

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,670
four, five, six, seven.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,110
So one way to think of it, if
I just said what is here?

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,240
How many 5's are there?

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,330
You'd say, well, I added 5 to
itself seven times, right?

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,360
You could literally say
this is 7 times 5.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,350
We could literally write, this
is 7 times 5, or you could

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,230
view it as 5 seven times.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,990
I'm not even writing it
mathematically yet.

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,470
I'm just saying, look, if I saw
seven of something, you

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,010
would literally say, if these
were apples, you would say

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,030
apples seven times, or you'd
say seven times the apple,

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,040
whatever it is.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,810
Now, in this case, we're
actually adding the number to

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,180
each other, and we could figure
out what that is, and

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,160
why don't we?

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,680
But the way we would write this
mathematically, we would

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,090
say this is 7 times 5.

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,610
We could also write
it like this.

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,190
We could write it 7 dot 5.

28
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,580
This and this mean the
exact same thing.

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,440
It means we're multiplying
7 times 5 or 5 times 7.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,110
You can actually switch the
order, and you get the exact

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,250
same value.

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,890
You could actually write
it 5 times 7.

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,160
So you could interpret this as 7
five times or 5 seven times,

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,840
however you like to do
it, or 5 seven times.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,610
I don't want to confuse you.

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,350
I just want to show you that
these are all equivalent.

37
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,250
This is also equivalent.

38
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,150
5 times 7.

39
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,080
Same thing.

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,050
You could write them
in parentheses.

41
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,560
You could write it like this.

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,300
This all means the same thing.

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,040
That's 7 times 5,
and so is this.

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,220
These all evaluate to the
same thing: 5 times 7.

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,030
So these are all equivalent, and
since we've worked with it

46
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,720
so much, let's just figure
out the answer.

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,880
So if we add up 5 to itself
seven times, what do we get?

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,740
Well, 5 plus 5 is 10.

49
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,210
10 plus 5 is 15, plus 5 is 20,
plus 5 is 25, plus 5 is 30,

50
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,789
plus 5 is 35.

51
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:22,150
So all of these evaluate to
35, just so you see that

52
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,550
they're the same thing.

53
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,790
These are all equivalent
to 35.

54
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,850
And just something to think
about, this is also the exact

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,350
same thing, depending on how you
want to interpret this, as

56
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,695
7 five times.

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,510
They didn't ask us to do it, but
I thought I would point it

58
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,380
out to you.

59
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,080
7 five times would look like
this: 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,410
plus 7, right?

61
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,950
I have 7 five times.

62
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,370
I added it to itself five
different times.

63
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,820
There's five 7's here
added to each other.

64
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,050
And when you add these up,
you'll also get 35.

65
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,560
And that's why 5 times 7 and 7
times 5 is the same thing.

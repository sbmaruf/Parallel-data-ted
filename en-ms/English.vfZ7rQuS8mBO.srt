1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:12,390
Let's say we have the equation
7 times x is equal to 14.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,970
Now before even trying to solve
this equation, what I want to

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,080
do is think a little bit about
what this actually means.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,870
7x equals 14, this is the exact
same thing as saying 7 times x

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:35,000
-- let me write it this way --
7 times x -- we'll do the x in

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,270
orange again -- 7 times
x is equal to 14.

7
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,860
Now you might be able to
do this in your head.

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,490
You could literally go
through the 7 times table.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,960
You say well 7 times 1 is equal
to 7, so that won't work.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,350
7 times 2 is equal to
14, so 2 works here.

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,920
So you would immediately
be able to solve it.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,510
You would immediately, just
by trying different numbers

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,220
out, say hey, that's
going to be a 2.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,200
But what we're going to do in
this video is to think about

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,780
how to solve this
systematically.

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,100
Because what we're going to
find is as these equations get

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,680
more and more complicated,
you're not going to be able to

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,670
just think about it and
do it in your head.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,590
So it's really important that
one, you understand how to

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,510
manipulate these equations,
but even more important to

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,280
understand what they
actually represent.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,090
This literally just says 7
times x is equal to 14.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,530
In algebra we don't
write the times there.

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,620
When you write two numbers next
to each other or a number next

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,280
to a variable like this, it
just means that you

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,100
are multiplying.

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,920
It's just a shorthand,
a shorthand notation.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
And in general we don't use the
multiplication sign because

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,970
it's confusing, because x is
the most common variable

30
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,840
used in algebra.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,330
And if I were to write 7 times
x is equal to 14, if I write my

32
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,140
times sign or my x a little
bit strange, it might look

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,150
like xx or times times.

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,410
So in general when you're
dealing with equations,

35
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,910
especially when one of the
variables is an x, you

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,350
wouldn't use the traditional
multiplication sign.

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,020
You might use something like
this -- you might use dot to

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,130
represent multiplication.

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,040
So you might have 7
times is equal to 14.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,720
But this is still
a little unusual.

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,750
If you have something
multiplying by a variable

42
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,080
you'll just write 7x.

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,210
That literally means 7 times x.

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,750
Now, to understand how you can
manipulate this equation to

45
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,040
solve it, let's visualize this.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,710
So 7 times x, what is that?

47
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,690
That's the same thing -- so I'm
just going to re-write this

48
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,720
equation, but I'm going to
re-write it in visual form.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,880
So 7 times x.

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,740
So that literally means x
added to itself 7 times.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,230
That's the definition
of multiplication.

52
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,900
So it's literally x plus x plus
x plus x plus x -- let's see,

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,830
that's 5 x's -- plus x plus x.

54
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,660
So that right there
is literally 7 x's.

55
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,300
This is 7x right there.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,270
Let me re-write it down.

57
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,030
This right here is 7x.

58
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,610
Now this equation tells us
that 7x is equal to 14.

59
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,800
So just saying that
this is equal to 14.

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,300
Let me draw 14 objects here.

61
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,640
So let's say I have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,640
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,790
So literally we're saying
7x is equal to 14 things.

64
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,070
These are equivalent
statements.

65
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,280
Now the reason why I drew
it out this way is so that

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,950
you really understand what
we're going to do when we

67
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,110
divide both sides by 7.

68
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,820
So let me erase
this right here.

69
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,180
So the standard step whenever
-- I didn't want to do that,

70
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:48,725
let me do this, let me
draw that last circle.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,360
So in general, whenever you
simplify an equation down to a

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,080
-- a coefficient is just the
number multiplying

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,750
the variable.

74
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,470
So some number multiplying the
variable or we could call that

75
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:00,995
the coefficient times a
variable equal to

76
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,990
something else.

77
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,210
What you want to do is just
divide both sides by 7 in

78
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,240
this case, or divide both
sides by the coefficient.

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,130
So if you divide both sides
by 7, what do you get?

80
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,150
7 times something divided
by 7 is just going to be

81
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,690
that original something.

82
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,350
7's cancel out and 14
divided by 7 is 2.

83
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,180
So your solution is going
to be x is equal to 2.

84
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,200
But just to make it very
tangible in your head, what's

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,570
going on here is when we're
dividing both sides of the

86
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,260
equation by 7, we're literally
dividing both sides by 7.

87
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,250
This is an equation.

88
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,850
It's saying that this
is equal to that.

89
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,230
Anything I do to the left hand
side I have to do to the right.

90
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,130
If they start off being equal,
I can't just do an operation

91
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,970
to one side and have
it still be equal.

92
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,100
They were the same thing.

93
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,420
So if I divide the left hand
side by 7, so let me divide

94
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,150
it into seven groups.

95
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,920
So there are seven x's here,
so that's one, two, three,

96
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,690
four, five, six, seven.

97
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,780
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven groups.

98
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,240
Now if I divide that into
seven groups, I'll also want

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,350
to divide the right hand
side into seven groups.

100
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,530
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

101
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,370
So if this whole thing is equal
to this whole thing, then each

102
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,660
of these little chunks that we
broke into, these seven chunks,

103
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,860
are going to be equivalent.

104
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,070
So this chunk you could say
is equal to that chunk.

105
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,530
This chunk is equal to
this chunk -- they're

106
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,490
all equivalent chunks.

107
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,360
There are seven chunks
here, seven chunks here.

108
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,390
So each x must be equal
to two of these objects.

109
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,240
So we get x is equal to, in
this case -- in this case

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,830
we had the objects drawn
out where there's two of

111
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,680
them. x is equal to 2.

112
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,210
Now, let's just do a couple
more examples here just so it

113
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,570
really gets in your mind that
we're dealing with an equation,

114
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,325
and any operation that you do
on one side of the equation

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,540
you should do to the other.

116
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,040
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

117
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:13,550
So let's say I have I say
I have 3x is equal to 15.

118
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,640
Now once again, you might be
able to do is in your head.

119
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,780
You're saying this is
saying 3 times some

120
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,490
number is equal to 15.

121
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,380
You could go through your 3
times tables and figure it out.

122
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,150
But if you just wanted to do
this systematically, and it

123
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,680
is good to understand it
systematically, say OK, this

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,500
thing on the left is equal
to this thing on the right.

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
What do I have to do to
this thing on the left

126
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,645
to have just an x there?

127
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,690
Well to have just an x there,
I want to divide it by 3.

128
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,930
And my whole motivation for
doing that is that 3 times

129
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,620
something divided by 3, the 3's
will cancel out and I'm just

130
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,120
going to be left with an x.

131
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,190
Now, 3x was equal to 15.

132
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,240
If I'm dividing the left side
by 3, in order for the equality

133
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,230
to still hold, I also have to
divide the right side by 3.

134
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,560
Now what does that give us?

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,070
Well the left hand side, we're
just going to be left with

136
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,130
an x, so it's just
going to be an x.

137
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,040
And then the right hand side,
what is 15 divided by 3?

138
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,760
Well it is just 5.

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,570
Now you could also done this
equation in a slightly

140
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,140
different way, although they
are really equivalent.

141
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,160
If I start with 3x is equal to
15, you might say hey, Sal,

142
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,260
instead of dividing by 3, I
could also get rid of this 3, I

143
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,110
could just be left with an x if
I multiply both sides of

144
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,670
this equation by 1/3.

145
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,710
So if I multiply both sides
of this equation by 1/3

146
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,830
that should also work.

147
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,980
You say look, 1/3 of 3 is 1.

148
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,710
When you just multiply this
part right here, 1/3 times

149
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,170
3, that is just 1, 1x.

150
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:52,130
1x is equal to 15 times
1/3 third is equal to 5.

151
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,140
And 1 times x is the same thing
as just x, so this is the same

152
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,400
thing as x is equal to 5.

153
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,660
And these are actually
equivalent ways of doing it.

154
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,180
If you divide both sides by
3, that is equivalent to

155
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,340
multiplying both sides
of the equation by 1/3.

156
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,160
Now let's do one more and I'm
going to make it a little

157
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,270
bit more complicated.

158
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,840
And I'm going to change the
variable a little bit.

159
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:36,200
So let's say I have 2y
plus 4y is equal to 18.

160
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Now all of a sudden it's
a little harder to

161
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:38,536
do it in your head.

162
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,420
We're saying 2 times something
plus 4 times that same

163
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,260
something is going
to be equal to 18.

164
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,400
So it's harder to think
about what number that is.

165
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,110
You could try them.

166
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,910
Say if y was 1, it'd be 2
times 1 plus 4 times 1,

167
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,710
well that doesn't work.

168
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,390
But let's think about how
to do it systematically.

169
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,250
You could keep guessing and
you might eventually get

170
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,840
the answer, but how do you
do this systematically.

171
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,830
Let's visualize it.

172
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,540
So if I have two y's,
what does that mean?

173
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,800
It literally means I have two
y's added to each other.

174
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,990
So it's literally y plus y.

175
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,300
And then to that I'm
adding four y's.

176
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,350
To that I'm heading four y's,
which are literally four

177
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,090
y's added to each other.

178
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,220
So it's y plus y plus y plus y.

179
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,630
And that has got to
be equal to 18.

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,530
So that is equal to 18.

181
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,840
Now, how many y's do I have
here on the left hand side?

182
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,520
How many y's do I have?

183
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,590
I have one, two, three,
four, five, six y's.

184
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,070
So you could simplify this
as 6y is equal to 18.

185
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,930
And if you think about it
it makes complete sense.

186
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,350
So this thing right here,
the 2y plus the 4y is 6y.

187
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,320
So 2y plus 4y is 6y,
which makes sense.

188
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,840
If I have 2 apples plus
4 apples, I'm going

189
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,850
to have 6 apples.

190
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,810
If I have 2 y's plus 4 y's
I'm going to have 6 y's.

191
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,620
Now that's going to
be equal to 18.

192
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,250
And now, hopefully, we
understand how to do this.

193
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,490
If I have 6 times something is
equal to 18, if I divide both

194
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,710
sides of this equation by 6,
I'll solve for the something.

195
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:29,920
So divide the left hand
side by 6, and divide the

196
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,870
right hand side by 6.

197
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:39,100
And we are left with
y is equal to 3.

198
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,160
And you could try it out.

199
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,750
That's what's cool
about an equation.

200
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,290
You can always check to see
if you got the right answer.

201
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,220
Let's see if that works.

202
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:52,120
2 times 3 plus 4 times
3 is equal to what?

203
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,640
2 times 3, this
right here is 6.

204
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,580
And then 4 times 3 is 12.

205
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,410
6 plus 12 is, indeed,
equal to 18.

206
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,640
So it works out.

1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,870
Welcome to Level Four multiplication.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,892
Let's do some problems.

3
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:10,718
Let's say we had two hundred thirty-five times--

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,330
I'm going to use two different colors here, so bear with me a second.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,690
Let's say times forty-seven.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,498
So you start a Level four problem

7
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:26,960
just like you would normally do a Level Three problem.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,060
We'll take that seven, and we'll multiply it by two hundred thirty-five.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,165
So seven times five is thirty-five.

10
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:44,604
Seven times three is twenty-one, plus the three we just carried is twenty-four.

11
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:49,750
Seven times two is fourteen, plus the two we just carried.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,030
This is sixteen.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,560
So we're done with the seven.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,390
Now we have to deal with this four.

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, since that four is in the tens place, we add a zero here.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,187
You could almost view it as we're multiplying two hundred thirty-five, not by four,

17
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,044
but we're multiplying it by forty,

18
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:06,490
and that's why we put that zero there.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,310
But once you put the zero there, you can treat it just like a four.

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,903
So you say four times five, well, that's twenty.

21
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:17,665
Let's ignore what we had from before.

22
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:24,180
Four times three is twelve, plus the two we just carried, which is fourteen.

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,800
Four times two is eight, plus the one we just carried, so that's nine.

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,000
And now we just add up everything.

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:40,570
Five plus zero is five, four plus zero is four, six plus four is ten, carry the one,

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,670
and one plus one plus nine, well, that's eleven.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,220
So the answer is eleven thousand forty-five.

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,150
Let's do another problem.

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:56,882
Let's say I had eight hundred seventy-three times--

30
00:01:56,882 --> 00:02:00,559
and I'm making these numbers up on the fly, so bear with me--

31
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:06,085
eight hundred seventy-three times-- some high numbers--

32
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,082
ninety-- and I'm doing them in different colors,

33
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:10,791
just so you hopefully get a better understanding

34
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,110
of what I'm trying to explain.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,165
Let's say ninety-seven.

36
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:15,950
No, I just used a seven.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,869
Let's make it ninety-eight.

38
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,646
So just like we did before, we go to the ones place first,

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,588
and that's where that eight is,

40
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:26,714
and we multiply that eight times eight hundred seventy-three.

41
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:32,070
So eight times three is twenty-four, carry the two.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,090
Eight times seven is fifty-six, plus two is fifty-eight, carry the five.

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,400
Eight times eight is sixty-four, plus the five we just carried.

44
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,470
That's sixty-nine.

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,570
We're done with the eight.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,410
Now we have to multiply the nine,

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,830
or we could just do it as we're multiplying eight hundred seventy-three by ninety.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,006
But multiplying something by ninety is just the same thing

49
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,310
as multiplying something by nine and then adding a zero at the end.

50
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,028
So that's why I put a zero right here.

51
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,525
Let's say nine times three--

52
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:06,710
well, first, just to clean up things, let's get rid of what we had from before.

53
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,930
We say nine times three is twenty-seven, carry the two.

54
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,805
Nine times seven is sixty-three, plus the two that we just carried is sixty-five.

55
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,336
Carry the six.

56
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,480
Nine times eight is seventy-two, plus the six we just carried.

57
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,030
That's seventy-eight.

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,710
And now we just add again.

59
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:36,234
Four, eight plus seven is fifteen, one plus nine plus five is fifteen,

60
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:42,160
one plus six plus eight is also fifteen, and one plus seven, that's eight.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,183
So the answer, hopefully-- I don't have a calculator in front of me--

62
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,012
is eighty-five thousand five hundred fifty-four,

63
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:50,870
assuming I didn't make any careless mistakes.

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,900
Let's do one more problem.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,650
I think it'll hit the point home.

66
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,792
The next problem I'm going to do,

67
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,220
you can almost do it as a Level Five problem

68
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,595
because I'm actually going to multiply two three-digit numbers,

69
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,770
but it's really the same thing, and hopefully, you'll see the pattern.

70
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:10,971
So let's say I had two hundred thirty-four times--

71
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:13,848
and I'm going to use three colors now--

72
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:23,148
let's say six hundred forty-three.

73
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:26,010
So first we do the three, which is in the ones place,

74
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,940
and we multiply that times two hundred thirty-four.

75
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,300
Well, three times four is twelve, carry the one.

76
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,560
Three times three is nine, add the one.

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,610
That's ten, carry the one.

78
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,178
Three times two is six, plus one.

79
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:43,720
Well, that's seven.

80
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,539
And then we've done the--

81
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:46,950
I think I've made a mistake someplace.

82
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,430
Let me see.

83
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,860
Three times four is twelve.

84
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,338
Oh, no, I think that's correct.

85
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,430
I was confusing myself.

86
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,564
Okay, now we're ready to do the four, or the forty,

87
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:03,018
and since it's a forty, because it's in the tens place, we put a zero right here.

88
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,386
We say four times four--

89
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,134
well let's clean up the stuff at the top.

90
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,393
I always forget to do that.

91
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:12,135
Four times four, well, that's sixteen, carry the one.

92
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:19,120
Four times three, well that's twelve, plus one, well that's thirteen.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,670
Four times two is eight, plus the one, well that's nine.

94
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,468
And now we're done with the four, or the forty,

95
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:26,500
depending on how you want to view it.

96
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,354
Now we're ready for the six, or the six hundred.

97
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,874
Since it's a six hundred, we put two zeros here,

98
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,355
and we just treat it like a six.

99
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:37,177
Let's clean up what we did before.

100
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:41,220
So six times four is twenty-four, carry the two.

101
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,490
Six times three is eighteen, plus two is twenty, carry the two.

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,700
Six times two is twelve, plus two is fourteen.

103
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,460
And now we add it all up.

104
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,670
Two. Six. Seven plus three is ten.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,258
Fourteen, carry the one.

106
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:04,228
One plus nine is ten.

107
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,469
Carry the one.

108
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,370
That's five, that's one.

109
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,601
I hope you can see. I hope it's not falling off the screen,

110
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:13,690
the answer I get is a one hundred fifty thousand four hundred sixty-two.

111
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,958
I think you're ready now to try Level Four multiplication problems!

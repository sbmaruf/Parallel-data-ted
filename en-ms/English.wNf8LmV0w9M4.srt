1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
So we need to figure out what 46 plus 43 is.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,825
Let me write it down again

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:11,733
and I'll write it like this: 46 plus 43.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,554
What we do here is

5
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,336
we just first look at the ones place

6
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:17,856
We literally have 6 ones plus 3 ones

7
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:21,118
or you could say 6 and 3, and 6 plus 3 is just 9.

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,221
6 plus 3 is 9, so we have 9 ones.

9
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:27,000
And then you go to the tens place

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,267
and there's two ways to think about it.

11
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:34,200
You could view this as 4 plus 4 is equal to 8

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,241
but really, the reality of what we're doing

13
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:37,969
since we're operating in the tens place

14
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,067
this is really 40 plus 40 is equal to 80.

15
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,267
And we could do the same problem expanded out.

16
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:48,559
This is the same thing as 40 plus 6.

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,898
We've seen this before, right?

18
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:51,600
That's what 46 is.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,533
And then 43 is the same thing as 40 plus 3.

20
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,933
We've expanded these out before.

21
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,533
And so when you add them

22
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:06,333
when you add a 6 plus a 3, you get a 9.

23
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,262
When you add a 40 plus a 40, you get an 80.

24
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:14,436
So you get 80 plus 9, which is 89.

25
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:15,800
And the whole reason why I did this is

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,195
I wanted to show you that

27
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,831
when you're adding 4's in the tens place

28
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,667
you're really adding 40's.

29
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,600
The fact that it's in the tens place represents--

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,867
or the fact that the 4 is in the tens place

31
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,518
shows that it represents 40.

32
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:29,231
The fact that the 8's there

33
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:31,898
shows that it represents 80.

1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,640
Divide and write the answer
as a mixed number.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,770
And we have 3/5 divided
by 1/2.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,220
Now, whenever you're dividing
any fractions, you just have

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,200
to remember that dividing by a
fraction is the same thing as

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,970
multiplying by its reciprocal.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,810
So this thing right here is the
same thing as 3/5 times--

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,780
so this is our 3/5 right here,
and instead of a division

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,120
sign, you want a multiplication
sign, and

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,880
instead of a 1/2, you want to
take the reciprocal of 1/2,

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,510
which would be 2/1--
so times 2/1.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,770
So dividing by 1/2 is the
exact same thing as

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,360
multiplying by 2/1.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,000
And we just do this as a
straightforward multiplication

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,080
problem now.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,840
3 times 2 is 6, so our
new numerator is 6.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,950
5 times 1 is 5.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,360
So 3/5 divided by 1/2 as an
improper fraction is 6/5.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,220
Now, they want us to write
it as at mixed number.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,450
So we divide the 5 into
the 6, figure out how

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,300
many times it goes.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,530
That'll be the whole number
part of the mixed number.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,290
And then whatever's left over
will be the remaining

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,620
numerator over 5.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,160
So what we'll do is
take 5 into 6.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,600
5 goes into 6 one time.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,700
1 times 5 is 5.

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,360
Subtract.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,960
You have a remainder of 1.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:34,460
So 6/5 is equal to one whole,
or 5/5, and 1/5.

30
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,610
This 1 comes from whatever
is left over.

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,630
And now we're done!

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,730
3/5 divided by 1/2
is 1 and 1/5.

33
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,350
Now, the one thing that's not
obvious is why did this work?

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,660
Why is dividing by 1/2 the
same thing as multiplying

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,880
essentially by 2.

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,000
2/1 is the same thing as 2.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,890
And to do that, I'll do a little
side-- fairly simple--

38
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,870
example, but hopefully, it
gets the point across.

39
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,910
Let me take four objects.

40
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,850
So we have four objects:
one, two, three, four.

41
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,790
So I have four objects, and if
I were to divide into groups

42
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,300
of two, so I want to divide
it into groups of two.

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,210
So that is one group of two and
then that is another group

44
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,600
of two, how many groups
do I have?

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Well, 4 divided by 2, I have two
groups of two, so that is

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
equal to 2.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,460
Now, what if I took those
same four objects:

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,990
one, two, three, four.

49
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,160
So I'm taking those
same four objects.

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,890
Instead of dividing them into
groups of two, I want to

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,610
divide them into groups of 1/2,
which means each group

52
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,080
will have half of
an object in it.

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,960
So let's say that would be
one group right there.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,900
That is a second group.

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,140
That is a third group.

56
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,690
I think you see each group has
half of a circle in it.

57
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,280
That is the fourth.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,070
That's the fifth.

59
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,390
That's the sixth.

60
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,790
That's the seventh, and then
that's the eighth.

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,660
You have eight groups of 1/2,
so this is equal to 8.

62
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,920
And notice, now each of the
objects became two groups.

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,660
So you could say how many
groups do you have?

64
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,860
Well, you have four objects
and each of

65
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,290
them became two groups.

66
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,270
I'm looking for a
different color.

67
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,520
Each of them became
two groups, and so

68
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,840
you also have eight.

69
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,710
So dividing by 1/2 is the same
thing as multiplying by 2.

70
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,250
And you could think about it
with other numbers, but

71
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,020
hopefully, that gives you a
little bit of an intuition.

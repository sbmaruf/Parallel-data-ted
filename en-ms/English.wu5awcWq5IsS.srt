1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,380
Find the sum of negative 15 plus
negative 46 plus negative 29.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,180
To do this, let's
just first visualize

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,830
what each of these
numbers look like.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,300
So I'm going to draw a
number line for each of them.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,140
Negative 15 might look
something like this.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,790
So if this is 0 and let's
say that this is negative 15,

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,270
I could represent
negative 15 as--

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,960
if I'd like to-- an arrow that
points from 0 to negative 15.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,340
The length of the arrow is
the absolute value of this.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,920
It's the distance from 0.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,680
So the length here is 15.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,130
And the negative says that
we are pointing to the left.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,600
So the absolute value is 15.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,320
That's the length of that arrow.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,760
Let's do the same
thing for negative 46.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,820
So once again, let me
draw my number line.

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,070

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,270
0 is going to be
right over there.

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,420
And negative 46 is going
to be someplace over here.

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,610
Negative 46.

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,730
Notice, same exact idea.

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,720
The distance between negative
46 and 0-- or another way

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,130
to think about that is the
absolute value of negative 46--

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,215
this distance right over
here is going to be 46.

26
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:14,700

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,980
And its direction
is to the left.

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,167
That is why we get to
the number negative 46.

29
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,500
The negative really tells you
whether you're to the left

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,390
or to the right of 0,
but the absolute value

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,850
says how far are you to
the left or the right of 0.

32
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,345
And then, finally, let's do
the same thing for negative 29.

33
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:35,280

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,390
So once again, let me
draw my number line.

35
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,280

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,740
I want to use the yellow again.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,640
So draw my number line.

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,190
Let's say this is 0.

39
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,180
Then negative 29 is going
to be roughly over here.

40
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,600
I'm estimating it.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,510
And once again, negative 29
is exactly 29 away from 0.

42
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,120
So this length right over here
is 29, and it is to the left.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,630
That is why it is negative 29.

44
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,930
If it was positive 29, it
would be 29 to the right of 0.

45
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,090
So we've represented
all of these numbers.

46
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,389
And you can see what their
absolute values are like.

47
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,680
And now let's think about
what happens if you add them.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,910
So one way to think about
adding these numbers

49
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,090
is if you added
these arrows, if you

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,120
put this arrow on
top of this arrow

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,660
or to the left of this
arrow, if you started where

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,940
this arrow leaves off-- and
then you put this green arrow,

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,390
and then you put
the orange arrow.

54
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,160
So let's do that.

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,170

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,100
Let's draw that.

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,410
It's going to be a
longer arrow now.

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,720
So we're going to start at 0.

59
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,180
First, we have the negative 15.

60
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,520
So we're going to move
15 spaces to the left

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,765
to get us to negative 15.

62
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:46,580

63
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,740
Then we're going to go
46 spaces to the left

64
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,350
to get us to negative
15 plus negative 46.

65
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,770
So let me draw that.

66
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,740
So then we're going
to go-- and we're

67
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,160
going to figure out what
that number is in a second.

68
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,370
So then we're going
to go 46 to the left.

69
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,710
That's about that far.

70
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,120
Really just this arrow,
I'm now placing it.

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,260
I'm starting off where
the negative 15 left off,

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,410
and then I'm putting
that arrow after that.

73
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,555
And we don't know yet what
number this gets us to.

74
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,430
We're going to have to
do a little math here.

75
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,030
And that's actually the
point of this problem.

76
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,960
But we know what the
length of this arrow is.

77
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,645
The length of this arrow is 46.

78
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:27,260
It is 46 to the
left, and we know

79
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,500
the length of this
magenta arrow is 15.

80
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,910
And then, finally, we
have this orange arrow.

81
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,810
The orange arrow, which we
know has a length of 29.

82
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,670
Although, it's 29 to the left.

83
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,080
It looks like that.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,930
It has a length of 29.

85
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,790
So when all is said
and done, where are we?

86
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,590
Where do we end up
on our number line?

87
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,460
Well, the total length
that we are to the left

88
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,220
is going to be 15
plus 46 plus 29.

89
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,620
But it's going to
be to the left,

90
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,160
so it's going to be negative.

91
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,490
So what we can really view
this as, since all of these

92
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,020
have the same sign,
is we could say,

93
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,620
look, this is the same
thing as the absolute value

94
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,680
of negative 15, which is
15, plus the absolute value

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,210
of negative 46, which is
46, plus the absolute value

96
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,510
of negative 29,
which is 29, but then

97
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,260
take the negative value of it.

98
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,300
So let's just add that.

99
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:24,580
15 plus 46 plus 29 is equal
to, let's see-- 5 plus 6 is 11.

100
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,480
11 plus 9 is 20.

101
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,330
Carry the 2.

102
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,900
2 plus 1 is 3.

103
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,186
3 plus 4 is 7.

104
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,330
7 plus 2 is 9.

105
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,330
So you get 90.

106
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,120
So this entire
length here is 90.

107
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,300
The entire length, if you add
up the arrows, you get a 90.

108
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,220
But it is not 90 to the right.

109
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,870
So if it was 90 to the right,
these would all be positives.

110
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,578
And then we would just
get a positive 90.

111
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,020
But this is 90 to the left.

112
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,560
So when you add these guys up,
you don't get to positive 90.

113
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,860
You get to negative 90.

114
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,760
So one way to think about it
is these are all the same sign.

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,000
So this is going to be
equal to the negative

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,560
of the absolute
value of negative 15

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,710
plus the absolute
value of negative 46

118
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,410
plus the absolute
value of negative 29.

119
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,590
And the reason why we're
writing this here-- this

120
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,089
might look fancy,
but this is really

121
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:21,110
just the length of
this purple arrow.

122
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,440
This absolute value
of negative 46,

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,750
that's really just the
length of the green arrow.

124
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,890
46.

125
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,590
And this is just the
length of the orange arrow.

126
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,380
So this is 15 plus 46
plus 29, gave us 90,

127
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,600
but it is to the left.

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,391
So that is why it
is negative 90.

129
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:40,891

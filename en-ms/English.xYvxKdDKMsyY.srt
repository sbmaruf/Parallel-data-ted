1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:07,750
Let's say I go to a store and
I have $50 in my pocket.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,070
$50 in my wallet.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,110

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,670
And at the store that day
they say it is a 25%

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,680
off marked price sale.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,880
So 25% off marked price means
that if the marked price is

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,670
$100 the price I'm going
to pay is going to be

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,390
25% less than $100.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,830
So my question to you is if I
have $50, what is the highest

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,600
marked price I can afford?

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,270
Because I need to know that
before I go finding something

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,270
that I might like.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,920
So let's do a little
bit of algebra.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:05,240
So let x be the highest marked
price that I can afford.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,290
So if the sale is 25% off of x,
we could say that the new

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:20,680
price, the sale price will be x
minus 25% of x is equal

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,790
to the sale price.

19
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,730
And I'm assuming that I'm in
a state without sales tax.

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,760
Whatever the sale price is, is
what I have to pay in cash.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,820
So x minus 25% x is equal
to the sale price.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,860
The discount is going
to be 25% of x.

23
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:44,490
But we know that this is the
same thing as x minus 0.25x.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,530
And we know that that's the
same thing as-- well, because

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,600
we know this is 1x, x is
the same thing is 1x.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,910
1x minus 0.25x.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:02:00,050
Well, that means that 0.75x is
equal to the sale price, right?

28
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:07,180
All I did is I rewrote x minus
25% of x as 1x minus 0.25x.

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,300
And that's the same
thing as 0.75x.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,180
Because 1 minus 0.25 is 0.75.

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,290
So 0.75x is going to
be the sale price.

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,980
Well, what's the sale
price that I can afford?

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,440
Well, the sale price
I can afford is $50.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,725
So 0.75x is going to equal $50.

35
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,430

36
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,820
If x is any larger number than
the number I'm solving for,

37
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,330
then the sale price is going
to be more than $50 and I

38
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,360
won't be able to afford it.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,520
So that's how we set the--
the highest I can pay is $50

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,950
and that's the sale price.

41
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,170
So going back to how we did
these problems before.

42
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,710
We just divide both
sides by 0.75.

43
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,120
And we say that the highest
marked price that I can afford

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,010
is $50 divided by 0.75.

45
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,410
And let's figure
out what that is.

46
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,490
0.75 goes into 50-- let's
add some 0's in the back.

47
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,815
If I take this decimal
2 to the right.

48
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:15,220
Take this decimal, move it 2 to
the right, goes right there.

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,930
So 0.75 goes into 50 the
same number of times

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,950
that 75 goes into 5,000.

51
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,790
So let's do this.

52
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,870
75 goes into 50 zero times.

53
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,710
75 goes into 500-- so let
me think about that.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,065
I think it goes
into it six times.

55
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:34,730

56
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,110
Because seven times is
going to be too much.

57
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,040
So it goes into it six times.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,840
6 times 5 is 30.

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,890
6 times 7 is 42.

60
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,040
Plus 3 is 45.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,150
So the remainder is 50.

62
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,270
I see a pattern.

63
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,640
Bring down the 0.

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Well, same thing again.

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,620
75 goes into 500 six times.

66
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,670
6 times 75 is going
to be 450 again.

67
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,730
We're going to keep having
that same pattern over

68
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,600
and over and over again.

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,100
It's actually 66.666-- I hope
you don't think I'm an evil

70
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,500
person because of this number
that happened to show up.

71
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,090
But anyway, so the highest sale
price that I can afford or the

72
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,270
highest marked price I can
afford is $66 dollars.

73
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,420
And if I were to around up,
and $0.67 if I were to

74
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,070
round to the nearest penny.

75
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,350
If I were to write this kind of
as a repeating decimal, I could

76
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,800
write this as 66.66 repeating.

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,150
Or I also know that 0.6666
going on forever is

78
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,230
the same thing as 2/3.

79
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,580
So it's 66 and 2/3.

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,290
But since we're working with
money and we're working with

81
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,280
dollars, we should just
round to the nearest penny.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,320
So the highest marked price
that I can afford is $66.67.

83
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,830
So if I go and I see a
nice pair of shoes for

84
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,360
$55, I can afford it.

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,580
If I see a nice tie for $70,
I can't afford it with

86
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,350
the $50 in my pocket.

87
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,620
So hopefully not only will this
teach you a little bit of math,

88
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,680
but it'll help you do a
little bit of shopping.

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,430
So let me ask you
another problem, a very

90
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,760
interesting problem.

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,480
Let's say I start with an
arbitrary-- let's put

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,210
a fixed number on it.

93
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,260
Let's say I start with $100.

94
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:35,630
And after one year
it grows by 25%.

95
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,690

96
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,000
And then the next year,
let's call that year

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
two, it shrinks by 25%.

98
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
So this could have happened
in the stock market.

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,370
The first year I have a
good year, my portfolio

100
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,070
grows by 25%.

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,990
The second year I have a
bad year and my portfolio

102
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,730
shrinks by 25%.

103
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,540
So my question is how much
money do I have at the

104
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,930
end of the two years?

105
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,070
Well a lot of people might
say, oh, this is easy, Sal.

106
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,270
If I grow by 25% and then I
shrink by 25% I'll end up with

107
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,320
the same amount of money.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,780
But I'll show you it's actually
not that simple because the 25%

109
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,520
in either case or in both cases
is actually a different

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,100
amount of money.

111
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,590
So let's figure this out.

112
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:27,100
If I start with $100 and I grow
it by 25%-- 25% of $100 is $25.

113
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,260
So I grew it by $25.

114
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,300
So I go to $125.

115
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,590
So after one year of growing
by 25% I end up with $125.

116
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,670
And now this $125 is
going to shrink by 25$.

117
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,320
So if something shrinks by 25%,
that means it's just going to

118
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,680
be 0.75 or 75% of what
it was before, right?

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,850
1 minus 25%.

120
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,500
0.75 times $125.

121
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,830
So let's work that out here.

122
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,325
$125 times 0.75.

123
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:10,770
And just in case you're
confused, I don't want to

124
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,800
repeat it too much, but if
something shrinks by 25% it is

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,790
now 75% of its original value.

126
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:23,140
So if $125 shrinks by 25% it's
now 75% of $125 or 0.75.

127
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,440
Let's do the math.

128
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,980
5 times 5 is 25.

129
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,810
2 times 5 is 10 plus 2 is 12.

130
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,800
1 times 5-- 7.

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,510
7 times 5 is 35.

132
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,100
7 times 2 is 14.

133
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,750
Plus 3 is 17.

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,560
Sorry.

135
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,880
7 times 1 is 7.

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,980
Plus 1 is 8.

137
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,800
So it's 5, 7, and then
this is 7 actually.

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,130
14.

139
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,490
9.

140
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,260
94.75, right?

141
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,230
Two decimal points.

142
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,410
94.75.

143
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,750
So it's interesting.

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,390
If I start with $100 and it
grows by 25%, and then it

145
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,450
shrinks by 25% I end up with
less than I started with.

146
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,890
And I want you to think
about why that happens.

147
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,400
Because 25% on $100 is the
amount that I'm gaining.

148
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,790
That's a smaller number than
the amount that I'm losing.

149
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,330
I'm losing 25% on $125.

150
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,280
That's pretty interesting,
don't you think?

151
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,100
That's actually very
interesting when a lot of

152
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,480
people compare-- well, actually
I won't go into stock

153
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,340
returns and things.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,825
But I think that should be a
pretty interesting thing.

155
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,290
You should try that out
with other examples.

156
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,700
Another interesting thing is
for any percentage gain, you

157
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,050
should think about how much you
would have to lose-- what

158
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,260
percentage you would
have to lose to end

159
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,050
up where you started.

160
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,080
That's another
interesting project.

161
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,700
Maybe I'll do that in a
future presentation.

162
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,430
Anyway, I think you're now
ready to do some of those

163
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,200
percent madness problems.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,330
Hope you have fun.

165
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,630
Bye.

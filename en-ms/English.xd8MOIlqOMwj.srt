1
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:08,886
The Shinwha group has selected as one of the biggest sponsors for the 2012 olympics ..

2
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:11,789
In the middle of a global financial crisis . .

3
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,146
Since the start of the Korean economic development.

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:16,784
a single company has been holding the highest ranking

5
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,143
continuing with its ever continuous growth.

6
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:23,476
Shinhwa has finally been established in the international market as a world-class company.

7
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:27,022
...And that company is Shinhwa.

8
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:31,028
From electronics...oil refining and automobiles...to delivery...and telecommunications,

9
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,735
and even if you're a Korean who doesn't know the President's name,

10
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,756
you would have definitely have come across the words "ShinHwa."

11
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:44,931
It is a massive empire; a model of Korean conglomerate.

12
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,449
The day ShinHwa achieved an unprecedented $10 billion in export....

13
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:55,061
Instead of accepting a medal of honor, the founder was invited to the Blue House, and it was there that he said,

14
00:00:55,061 --> 00:01:02,973
"Mr. President...please let me build aschool for my grandchildren."

15
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:06,513
Incorporated Association, ShinHwa Academy....

16
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:10,762
The school is the first of its kind to be seen in the history of Korean education

17
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:15,046
it was During a time when economic development was more important than equal opportunities in education

18
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:18,512
the president even spared every expense and even passed special laws to make his school a reality.

19
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:24,376
Now there's even a saying that a family won't getanywhere without a ShinHwa graduate..

20
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:33,011
ShinHwa is based on built by the top 1% of Korean society, for the top 1% of society.

21
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:39,023
Also, Enrollment is so competitive that even most upper class children would be unable to receive acceptance even if they were to apply for registration the moment after their birth.

22
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:45,527
However, once enrolled, students can attend ShinHwa from elementary, middle and high school all the way to university.

23
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:54,356
For all the Korean students and parents frustrated by college entrance exams, ShinHwa is both the object of their hatred and envy of every citizen.

24
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:58,235
However, in this school for the chosen sons and daughters of God..

25
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:32,586
something beyond anyone's imagination is happening..

26
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:37,457
Oh, poor MinHa...what shall we do about this?

27
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:43,398
You bastard!

28
00:02:43,398 --> 00:03:05,831
Aish.Damn it! Get him! Get him!

29
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,781
How may I help you?

30
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:14,082
I have a delivery from JanDi's Dry Cleaning Service....

31
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:17,822
Okay, you may go in.

32
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:34,811
Thank you!

33
00:03:34,811 --> 00:04:26,401
Ahh this isn't it

34
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:46,954
Find him!!!

35
00:04:46,954 --> 00:05:38,839
There!! There he is! Get him!

36
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,476
wahh..Is this really a school?

37
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:46,146
Hey, he's on the rooftop! Lee Min Ha is going to jump!

38
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,247
whoah..Are you serious?

39
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,736
Is he putting on a show? No, this is for real!!

40
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:52,753
Really? Are you for real??

41
00:05:52,753 --> 00:06:17,311
Lee MinHa??? oh!!! Lee MinHa!

42
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,512
I was right, huh?

43
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,047
He couldn't even last a week.

44
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,687
But he did survive three days.

45
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:41,702
It wasn't even three days. Exactly speaking . . .

46
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:45,738
This is what you guys wanted... right?

47
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,623
Fine,....

48
00:06:47,623 --> 00:07:00,721
I'll do as you guys wish.

49
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:04,754
Hey! Hey! Wait a moment, Lee Min Ah!!!!

50
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:08,762
Oh no,...what a customer!!

51
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,031
Who are you???

52
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:15,135
Me? Oh, hehhh. i'm . . .

53
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,007
i have a delivery for you!

54
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,773
JanDi Cleaners. It is $30.

55
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:26,346
Oh ,my God! This is funny!!

56
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:30,783
OK, OK, $25.!

57
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,654
The gym suit is free. In return, you should be a patron..

58
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:39,392
After I die, settle it with my family...

59
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,911
Oh! Don't be like that...

60
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:45,943
D-d-die??!?

61
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,673
Are you going to die right now??

62
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:54,041
Why??

63
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,308
I mean..come on..

64
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,746
You attend such a great school!

65
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,078
This isnt a school...

66
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,005
This is hell..

67
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,951
Excuse me!!

68
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:12,225
The real hell is out there. .. Have you everheard about the hell of college entrance exams??

69
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,896
Have you ever heard of F4???

70
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,865
F..F.. what?

71
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,768
F4??

72
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,336
....What is that???

73
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:29,666
Once you get their red card, you becomethe target of all the students in school...

74
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:36,482
Just like me...

75
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,852
So are you gonna just sit back and take it??

76
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,157
Losers like that always move around in large groups doing cruel things..

77
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:53,066
If it was my school, I would catch them and kick all of their asses!!

78
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,039
How lucky...

79
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,105
your friends are....

80
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,732
Huh??

81
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:03,443
Your friends, they're lucky to have a friend like you..

82
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:10,817
Not really. hahaha.

83
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:28,369
NOOOO!!

84
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,672
At the cradle of privileged education...ShinHwa High School,

85
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,907
saving an ostracized student was..

86
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,942
neither a son of chaebol nor of honorable family..

87
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,028
but an ordinary girl who was there to deliver laundry.!

88
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:43,183
The sons of God who are exemptfrom college entrance by way of wealth!!

89
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,385
If you guys have nothing to do...you should try taking the SAT!!

90
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,922
If such a thing should come from privilege, it deserves capital punishment!ShinHwa group.. should blow itself up!

91
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:55,644
As a parent, I can't forgive them. I refuse to continue shopping at ShinHwa Mart.!!

92
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:59,461
ShinHwa Group, give us an explanation!Give us an explanation! Give us an explanation!!

93
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:02,919
ShinHwa Group, give us an explanation!Give us an explanation! Give us an explanation!!!

94
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,089
Abolish the elite education system!!!

95
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:11,912
I amm here now where people are protesting against the Shinhwa Group and they request to have Shinhwa elitist educational system.

96
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,367
Now, let's hear from one of the protesters.

97
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:17,485
Hello, what brought you out here today??

98
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:20,736
My friend was also heavily bulliedand he dropped out of school...

99
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:29,985
That sort of thing can happen because of the unbearable stress of the entrance exams, but at a place like this they shouldn't have to suffer those kinds of hardships.

100
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:33,216
JanDi, do you know what your nickname is?

101
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:37,782
Common hero, Wonder Girl, you areour generation's true Wonder Woman.

102
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:42,911
Geum JanDi Laundry, fighting!Send the Wonder Girl to ShinHwa High school!

103
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:45,772
Stop it!

104
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:46,507
Cool.

105
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:50,432
By the way, the Flower 4 . . .

106
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,515
Are they really so doll-faced?

107
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,643
I wish I could see them up close in person.

108
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:58,901
Flower 4?

109
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:03,561
What flower 4? Fly 4 makes more sense,

110
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:15,099
four dung flies.

111
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,136
Miss Jandi, please look over here!

112
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,728
Miss, please say something.

113
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:33,109
Excuse me! Look here! Smile!

114
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,757
Is that school for gifted people?

115
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:40,783
It's neither a science school nor a foreign language school. It's literally a school for the rich.

116
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,432
Doesn't Korea pursue a fair society?

117
00:11:43,432 --> 00:12:11,014
That bourgeoisie school is . . .

118
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:12,075
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

119
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:16,565
The group PR department and related companies are trying their best to extinguish the public opinion.

120
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:20,922
Extinguish? Do you think this is being extinguished?

121
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:25,828
How do you let the reporters dare?! Dare to mention JoonPyo's name?

122
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,554
I'm deeply ashamed.

123
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:31,466
Do you know why public opinion is something to be wary of?

124
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,904
Because it is ignorant.

125
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:36,539
Once it goes berserk, it's unmanageable.

126
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:41,978
Reason or common sense doesn't work any more.

127
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:47,005
The one who set the fire should extinguish it.

128
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,786
Madam Chairman, the prime minister is on the line.

129
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:53,957
Yes, sir.

130
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,124
Yes,

131
00:12:55,124 --> 00:13:05,868
It's getting interesting.

132
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,872
I was never cut out for hiding from the paparazzi!

133
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,563
What a tough delivery! Shoot!

134
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:29,795
I'm really sick and tired of this ShinHwa school or F 4 something.

135
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,094
I'm ho . . .

136
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:35,264
She's here! JanDi!

137
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:37,539
Say hello to him.

138
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,905
He came from the ShinHwa Chairman's office.

139
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:48,377
So I finally meet the famous wonder girl. Nice to meet you.

140
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:50,674
I didn't push him.

141
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:54,284
Really, I didn't. F4 or something, they did it.

142
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:55,384
That's not it.

143
00:13:55,384 --> 00:14:00,563
JanDi, my daughter, calm down and just listen.

144
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:05,006
Starting tomorrow, you will attend ShinHwa High .

145
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:09,298
You're in!

146
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,698
What the heck are you . . .

147
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:11,434
To tell the truth . . .

148
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:16,539
The Chairman has come to admire you, and she decided to accept you as a special scholarship student!

149
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,207
SHE DECIDED TO ACCEPT YOU!

150
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,143
Scholarship student? Why me?

151
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:22,278
We would like you, Geum JanDi . . .

152
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,513
Noona, you know how you used to swim back in middle school?

153
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:29,819
She wants you to swim again! SWIM AGAIN!

154
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,222
I don't want to!

155
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,056
What?

156
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:34,079
And why not?

157
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,026
Noona, are you crazy?

158
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:41,113
I like the way things are now.

159
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:45,004
I wouldn't fit into the school andI don't want to go to that school either.

160
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:49,572
You should probably go.

161
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:52,308
JanDi, why don't you think about it a litt-

162
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,412
There's no need to think about anything.She will be there tomorrow.

163
00:14:56,412 --> 00:15:00,083
Shut up!

164
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:09,491
JanDi: Why not?Mom: Shut up!

165
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,096
Then, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

166
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:14,013
Yes, even if I have to drag her by the neck,I will make sure she's at school tomorrow.

167
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:21,204
Okay then.

168
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:24,374
Mr. Secretary,

169
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:51,007
you are aware of the phrase "Nak Jang Bool Ip."? "What's done cannot be undone.", right?

170
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,806
MOM!

171
00:15:53,806 --> 00:16:02,211
Be quiet and just take a look at this!

172
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:12,287
ShinHwa High! ShinHwa High! ShinHwa High!

173
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,655
Sister,

174
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,792
I really didn't think this day would come in my lifetime.

175
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:24,066
For the first time in my life, I am proud to be your brother.

176
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,567
Dad! Wooooohhh!

177
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,017
How can the words, "I'm not going" evencome out of your mouth?

178
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:32,407
Do you even know how much the tuition is?

179
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,876
No. I still don't want to.

180
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,711
I still don't want to go. Mom, I really don't want to.

181
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,514
Oh my!

182
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:42,518
Others study hard, have the money, and they still aren't able to get in . Why wouldn't you want to go?

183
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:47,798
Wasn't it you who's always saying those people only know how to brag about their wealth?

184
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:52,861
It, it, it was jealousy.

185
00:16:52,861 --> 00:17:00,669
The truth is, it's like winning the lottery. Who wouldn't be happy?

186
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:04,306
I don't care. I have a bad feeling about this.

187
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:14,717
Just to let you know, regardless ofwhat you say, I'm not going.

188
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:18,854
But, you like to swim.

189
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:23,692
You said you wanted to go to a school with a swimming pool.

190
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:28,897
Are you trying to get me to go to that school by saying they have a swimming pool?

191
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:49,551
I"m not going. I don't want to. I'll never go!

192
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,753
Wait!

193
00:17:51,753 --> 00:18:12,034
Just wait a minute, miss!

194
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,109
I'll go and come back.(A Korean saying when they leave the house etc.)

195
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:18,213
Geum Jan Di, Fight!

196
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,088
Go on

197
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:28,039
Dry cleaning is here,dryyyy cleaningggg!

198
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:35,597
JanDi dryyyyyy cleaningggg!

199
00:18:35,597 --> 00:19:27,983
Dry cleaning is hereeee!JanDi dryyyyyy cleaningggg!

200
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:35,191
Isn't it pretty?Yeah, it is.

201
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:40,195
There were only two made imported from Japan.I got myself one, guess who bought the other?

202
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:41,083
Who?

203
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,099
Goo JoonPyo.

204
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,006
That's really cool!

205
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:47,035
Don't you think my style is a lot better?

206
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,585
Hey, let me borrow it.

207
00:19:48,585 --> 00:20:07,437
Hey, me too, me too!

208
00:20:07,437 --> 00:21:38,928
Just where is it?

209
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:48,872
Uhhmm, do you know where the swimming pool is?

210
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:53,343
Oh, that way? Thank you.

211
00:21:53,343 --> 00:22:00,918
I'm so sorry for interrupting. You can continue on.

212
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:22,372
Goodbye!

213
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:38,614
AH! It's F4! AHHHH!

214
00:22:38,614 --> 00:23:42,452
Move it!

215
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:44,521
Is something wrong?

216
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,956
I will give you to a count of three.

217
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,902
What? What for?

218
00:23:49,902 --> 00:23:52,828
Three . . .

219
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:55,232
Two . . .

220
00:23:55,232 --> 00:24:02,873
One.

221
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:06,109
Hey, WooBin, do you have some juice left?

222
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:39,443
Yeah, you want it?

223
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:50,654
Hey, are you okay?

224
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:56,425
What kind of crazy person is that?!

225
00:24:56,425 --> 00:25:01,565
Why didn't anyone say anything?How can they just stand there?

226
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:04,367
oh my god

227
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:08,805
Watch your mouth.

228
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:10,607
Who are you guys?

229
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:15,645
Us? By the way, sorry for the late greeting.

230
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:20,116
We are Ginger!

231
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:21,484
Sunny!

232
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,186
Miranda!

233
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:27,958
We are the Jin, Sun, Mi (the true, the good and the beautiful)of ShinHwa High School.

234
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:37,788
What you were saying before, it wasn'tregarding the F4 was it transfer student?

235
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:41,538
F, F what?

236
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:47,477
So that guy who made a sceneis a member of the notorious F4?

237
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:50,013
notorious?

238
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,015
You mean famous.

239
00:25:52,015 --> 00:26:00,039
If you're not careful with what you say, you'll be in big trouble!

240
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,594
I hear your family owns a laundry shop..

241
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:08,498
It's not a laundromat. It's a dry cleaners.

242
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:09,866
So, what?

243
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:14,671
This is my first time seeing a dry cleaner's daughter.

244
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:21,277
It's very fascinating.

245
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:26,449
Look all you want, I won't charge you.

246
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:33,823
Since this is your first day of school and you're a commoner who knows nothing of the world, I'll let you off this time.

247
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:34,924
What?

248
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:37,794
For the things you said about the F4!

249
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:42,465
What? Are they that remarkable?

250
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:50,673
Hey transfer student, you really don'tknow a thing about the F4 do you?

251
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:59,316
No, I don't.

252
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:17,901
Girls, let's go.

253
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:22,205
Song WooBin, the son of Il Sim Construction,also know as the blue-chip stock of the construction industry.

254
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:26,709
They are real estate tycoons. People sayhalf of Jejudo belongs to Il-Sim.

255
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:31,548
The head family of Il-Sim-Pa,an organization(gang) of 50 years history.

256
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:35,051
They still have quite a few high-class clubs and saloons.

257
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:41,791
When it comes to cash mobilization,they are valued as King Wang Jjang.

258
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:47,897
So YiJung is a genius ceramic artist who debuted at Biennale at the age of 16 as the youngest artist.

259
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:53,503
He is one of the young artists to be selected by UNESCO.

260
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:57,034
There is at least one who made it on his own.

261
00:27:57,034 --> 00:28:00,343
Cast away the prejudice that genius would be poor.

262
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:07,683
You know the cultural assets independence fighter,So YoonHe, in Korean History textbooks?He is the owner of WooSong Museum and the grandfather of F4 So YiJung.

263
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,652
WooSong Museum?

264
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:13,155
Do you mean it's his family's? How rich are they?

265
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:22,499
Don't imagine. You'll hurt yourself.

266
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:26,335
That's a picture of the old president (of Korea).

267
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,439
Look at this kid sitting next to him.

268
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:34,994
He is F4's very own Yoon Ji Hoo.

269
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:37,547
The son and daughter-in-law ofYoon SeokYoung president died in a mysterious traffic accident.The only survivor was his five year-old grandson.

270
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:42,319
You mean Yoon JiHoo is thegrandson of President Yoon SeokYoung?

271
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,321
You know SooAm Art Center where Jang YoungJoo played?

272
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:51,006
He owns the SooAm Art Foundation, a soccer team in Europe and a Major League baseball team.

273
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:55,698
I envy him most in the world.

274
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:58,568
You know him without my explanation, right?

275
00:28:58,568 --> 00:30:10,448
This man is the F4 leader, Goo JoonPyo, the successor of the great ShinHwa group, whom even 3 year-old Korean kids know.

276
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:16,054
F4 are those sort of guys? No way!

277
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:20,192
Goo JoongPyo, you are Goo JoongMool (sewage)!

278
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:24,663
F4, you flies!

279
00:30:24,663 --> 00:30:29,734
If you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth,you should be thankful and be nice to people!

280
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:36,574
It's annoying that someone like you is the successor of ShinHwa group!

281
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:41,913
You better hope the two of us never come face to face.

282
00:30:41,913 --> 00:31:07,772
The day I have to call you "senior",I will dive from the rooftop! Ahhhh!

283
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:11,776
Yoon JiHoo!

284
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:16,982
How noisy.

285
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:19,517
It's so loud, I can't even sleep.

286
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:23,188
I'm so sorry. I thought no one was here.

287
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:27,292
Is that really true?

288
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:28,893
Eh?

289
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:32,998
That you will dive?

290
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:38,703
So, the thing is . . .

291
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:41,006
So you heard everything?

292
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:43,308
About what?

293
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,377
I mean . . .

294
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:57,522
Goo JungMool (sewage)? Or flies?

295
00:31:57,522 --> 00:32:03,594
Oh right, JoonPyo

296
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:04,463
Huh?

297
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:08,004
It's "Goo JoonPyo," not "Goo JoongPyo".

298
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:32,223
Remembering the right name is theleast thing to do when you hate someone, right?

299
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,892
Rice balls!

300
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:35,527
You like them?

301
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:35,961
What the heck are rice balls?

302
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:51,076
It looks so pretty and delicious!

303
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:53,211
What's that smell?

304
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:59,051
It completely stinks!

305
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:00,318
Oh, here it is.

306
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:05,079
Oh my god! Terrible!

307
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:12,083
Hey, transfer student, why are you eating such low grade food when there's an expensive spread over there?

308
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,865
What?

309
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:18,103
Then?

310
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:22,941
Over $50 for one meal is a nuisance in my home.

311
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:29,214
So, you're planning to keep eating these stinky lunch boxes?

312
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,882
Yes I am.

313
00:33:30,882 --> 00:33:49,334
God!

314
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:50,201
Good!

315
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:54,906
It's F4! AH!

316
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:59,011
MiSook, come on!

317
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:10,222
I'm going crazy!

318
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:21,132
Can I . . . try that?

319
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,935
Welcome!

320
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:34,846
Thank You!

321
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:36,014
Is she from Germany?

322
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:40,985
Yeah, she looks really pretty.I thought she was a doll or something.

323
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,922
Anyway, it's great that you made a friend already.

324
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:50,862
I was worried you might be a loner.

325
00:34:50,862 --> 00:34:52,063
I am a loner.

326
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:53,331
What?

327
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,401
I'm an outcast.

328
00:34:56,401 --> 00:35:00,538
But I'm thankful that I don't get noticed.

329
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:06,545
I'll stay a loner until the day I graduate.

330
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:09,147
Who are you?

331
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:12,082
What happened to our JanDi?

332
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:15,987
The one who protected me fromthat wicked kindergarten owner's son,

333
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:21,125
the one who fought against the gangs in junior high.All of that was the work of the justice girl: Geum JanDi.

334
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,627
So what's wrong?

335
00:35:22,627 --> 00:35:24,862
What can I do?

336
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:30,367
I'd sooner get into it with my mother before causingtrouble and being expelled from school.

337
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,502
You!Ah!

338
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:37,842
Do you think, do you think I'm wasting cucumbers?!

339
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:42,981
Your father wanted to eat cucumber kimchibut I'm investing it in your face.

340
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:46,005
What kind of investment are you doing with cucumbers?

341
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:48,092
Won't this treatment give you beautiful skin?

342
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:54,692
Even the worst boy in your school is thesuper A plus when it comes to marriage material.

343
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:58,496
It seems we've hit the jackpot. Don't you think so, honey?

344
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:02,007
Don't disturb me. I'm artistically sharpening the edge.

345
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:04,769
Mom, stop this!

346
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,807
Look at you, look at you!

347
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,843
Don't be so ungrateful!

348
00:36:11,843 --> 00:36:14,845
And why are you ironing that?

349
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,883
Your arms'll hurt because of ironing all day long.

350
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:23,621
15 years in the dry cleaning business and never once before have I seen such fine clothing.

351
00:36:23,621 --> 00:36:29,627
Ordinary people would be luckyto wear such cloth even on their wedding day.

352
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,329
Oh, boy!

353
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:35,567
Sister, let me borrow it to wear on Sunday.

354
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:41,105
JanDi, when it comes to clothes like this,you must treat them as kindly as your boss.

355
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,674
Be careful when you sit and stand up.

356
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:48,613
Take good care of it and avoid any stains. Understand?

357
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:55,072
I'm ironing this beautiful thing for my daughter. There's no way my arms would hurt from that. No, daddy's totally fine.

358
00:36:55,072 --> 00:37:00,425
Oh my!

359
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:10,335
That girl! Honey, you should iron the lining too, right?

360
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:14,705
Justice Girl Geum Jan Di hasn't died yet.

361
00:37:14,705 --> 00:37:18,509
Outcast in this way, outcast in that way, and thrown about anyway!

362
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,579
I will say what's on my mind!

363
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:41,633
F4, from tomorrow, you're all dead!

364
00:37:41,633 --> 00:38:13,898
It's F4!

365
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:19,737
JoonPyo senior, I baked this myself for you.

366
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:42,827
Please accept my heart.

367
00:38:42,827 --> 00:39:17,729
Our JoonPyo only eats cakes made by a top-notch patissier.

368
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:21,332
Who are you?

369
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:22,567
You have something to say?

370
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:28,372
Yeah, I have something to say! I have a lot to say!

371
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:31,007
You!

372
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:36,509
Do you have absolutely no respect for people?

373
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:39,179
I don't even expect you to have humility as a rich person.

374
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,649
If you didn't want to eat it, then youcould have rejected it nicely or . . .

375
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:46,886
Will it kill you to accept it by thinking of that person's effort?

376
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:52,492
What are you going to do if she says she'lljump off the roof, you bastard!

377
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:58,063
Who are you?

378
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:09,242
You have something to say?

379
00:40:09,242 --> 00:41:25,751
No.

380
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:29,455
Why are you swimming so hard? You'll become exhausted and faint.

381
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:31,257
It's punishment.

382
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:33,593
Punishment?

383
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:36,195
What did you do that was so bad?

384
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:42,968
It's the punishment that the Justice Girl inflictsupon the super obsequious.

385
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,671
So, do you feel better?

386
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,841
Yes.

387
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:53,546
All of the reasons why I'm going to this school are right here.

388
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:56,249
What are they?

389
00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:28,514
The swimming pool and Oh MinJi.

390
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:34,187
Senior!

391
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:38,658
I'm so sorry, JoonPyo senior.

392
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:40,086
Sorry?

393
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:47,399
If apologizing solved everything there wouldn't be laws and police officers.

394
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,736
But it was an accident.

395
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,239
I'll buy you the same exact shoes right away!

396
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,375
You, are you richer than me?

397
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,031
Pardon?

398
00:42:58,031 --> 00:43:00,879
Even if you had more money, it would be impossible.

399
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:04,116
These shoes were made by a craftsman in Firenze,

400
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:07,686
how could you possibly buy me theexact same ones immediately?

401
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:12,992
I'm really sorry. I'll do anything I can do to fix it.

402
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:14,066
Anything?

403
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:20,967
Yes!

404
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:25,872
Lick it.

405
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:27,039
Pardon?

406
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:33,413
I said to lick it.

407
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:34,447
Senior.

408
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:43,089
Didn't you say you'd do anything?

409
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:49,594
Isn't that enough?

410
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:53,833
You! You think she fell because she wanted to?

411
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,335
Apologizing is enough, don't you think?

412
00:43:56,335 --> 00:43:59,138
Who's this nosy person?

413
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:03,576
Hey second year! I'm guessing it hasn't beenlong since you returned (to Korea), but . . .

414
00:44:03,576 --> 00:44:06,946
you shouldn't try to use the American style here.

415
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:13,819
Why so informal?

416
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:19,392
Oh, so you're the famous "Wonder Girl"?

417
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:26,499
People were saying Wonder Woman and stuff,so I expected at least an "S" line and a "D" cup.

418
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:29,602
How homely!

419
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:32,204
So sorry to dissappoint you.

420
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:35,774
Is it comon for you to ignore your status and be so nosy?

421
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,061
Why are you butting into other people's business?

422
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:39,845
She' is my business. She's my friend.

423
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:44,083
I guess in rich people's dictionaries, there areno words like "friend" or "friendship"?

424
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,619
Friendship?

425
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:53,626
Let's see this great friendship you speak about.

426
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:58,898
Lick it.

427
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:00,232
What?!

428
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:29,162
I'll forget all about this if you lick it instead.

429
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:39,872
Hey!

430
00:45:39,872 --> 00:45:43,909
What's up with you?

431
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:49,147
Does she have more money than you?Did you yourself earn all of that money?

432
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:54,092
What? Is it common for me to be so nosy?

433
00:45:54,092 --> 00:46:16,676
It's common for me not to overlook rich bastards who think it's okay to act out because they wealthy families to bail them out. Why?!

434
00:46:16,676 --> 00:46:21,613
At our place, it's $2.50, but I calculatedit by Kangnam standards, ok?

435
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:32,392
If the stain still doesn't come out, then bring it by.

436
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:43,202
[JanDi Cleaners, 300-5648]

437
00:46:43,202 --> 00:47:18,237
What the hell is that piece of crap?!

438
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:19,906
What's the matter with JoonPyo?

439
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:37,723
I think he's still shocked from what happened today.He just keeps throwing darts.

440
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:40,293
What's with that serious face?

441
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:44,096
Don't bother me. Can't you hearthe wheels turning in my head?

442
00:47:44,096 --> 00:47:52,004
I'm thinking of the best way to completely crushthat little weed.

443
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:59,679
Why are you even bothering to think about her?Just handle things the way you always do.

444
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:20,433
Man! You really are smart!

445
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:53,499
JanDi Cleaners, you're dead now.

446
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:54,008
Look, look!

447
00:48:54,008 --> 00:49:02,675
Geum JanDi of second year Class B drew an F4 red card!

448
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:08,047
What is this, a soccer field?What are they talking about a red card?

449
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:35,658
(What?)

450
00:49:35,658 --> 00:49:40,495
Hello.Hello, Crazy!

451
00:49:40,495 --> 00:49:44,734
I guess your desk isn't here.

452
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,436
How can you study with us when you're a commoner?

453
00:49:47,436 --> 00:49:51,024
Why did you even come to school?

454
00:49:51,024 --> 00:50:00,783
My book.Hey, move over.

455
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:31,514
Get out of here! Annoying! Die! Go screw! Lick my froth!

456
00:50:31,514 --> 00:50:48,998
You're dead today.

457
00:50:48,998 --> 00:51:03,145
[Fuck off! Screw you!]

458
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:08,884
Who did this? If you have somethingto say, then then say it to my face!

459
00:51:08,884 --> 00:51:26,369
Who did it?

460
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:35,811
JanDi, when it comes to this kind of clothing, you must treat it as kindly as your boss. Be careful with it at all times.

461
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:46,622
This great suit is my daughter's.Why would my arms hurt? Daddy will be just fine.

462
00:51:46,622 --> 00:52:13,716
Throw more! Throw more! Just try and throw more!

463
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:18,521
Hey, hey, hey. Someone bring some oil.All we have to do now is to fry her.

464
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:29,332
What wil she be then? A pan fried pumpkin?

465
00:52:29,332 --> 00:52:59,528
Do more! Just try and do more!

466
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,664
Isn't it over now?

467
00:53:01,664 --> 00:53:08,537
What do you mean over?It'll be over when that commoner kneels before me.

468
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:13,242
So, that's why they say not to bother a sleeping wolf.

469
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:15,244
Don't you mean a lion?

470
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:17,879
It seems this time it won't even last a week.

471
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:21,416
1 week? I say three days.

472
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:27,222
Yi Jung, you, if I win, then I get that traditional pot from your last show.

473
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:31,016
For a fool that can't tell a pot from a water bottle, what's the sudden interest?

474
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:36,565
My baby is a fan of the potter, So YiJung.

475
00:53:36,565 --> 00:53:40,603
Okay. If I win, then I get the number of the Super Girls.

476
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:41,736
Deal!

477
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:48,544
Hey guys shut up. It's almost time for her to show up.

478
00:53:48,544 --> 00:54:03,959
Alright. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Jjang!

479
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:09,098
Ah, that's right. She's probably embarrassed toshow up in front of me in that disastrous state.

480
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:14,903
Yep, I was a bit hasty. One more time.

481
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:17,139
5,

482
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:20,091
4,

483
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:25,381
3,

484
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:31,022
2,

485
00:54:31,022 --> 00:54:40,696
1 . . .

486
00:54:40,696 --> 00:54:45,267
What's wrong with you guys? Did you do it right?

487
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:48,137
Then, why isn't she here?

488
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:52,908
Where the hell did that chick go?

489
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:56,378
Surrender? You wish!

490
00:54:56,378 --> 00:55:01,149
I say JanDi, and you thinkit's grass for you to walk all over?

491
00:55:01,149 --> 00:55:04,019
You picked on the wrong person!

492
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,589
Have you guys ever eaten dough soupthat has been cooked with tears?

493
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:11,059
Have you ever seen a free pass to the public bath house?

494
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:21,504
Commoners are nothing if not unyieldingand persevering! You should know that!

495
00:55:21,504 --> 00:55:23,973
How many eggs did they just throw away?

496
00:55:23,973 --> 00:55:30,245
Those idiots don't even know howprecious flour is. What's wrong with them?!

497
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:32,088
So wasteful . . .

498
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:39,755
How many pancakes could they have made with these?! Seriously!

499
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:42,925
Oh my!

500
00:55:42,925 --> 00:55:45,046
Who's there?

501
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:53,702
You're really noisy every time I see you.

502
00:55:53,702 --> 00:55:57,206
Do you know how to make pancakes?

503
00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:59,041
What?

504
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:04,213
Pancakes.

505
00:56:04,213 --> 00:56:14,824
All you have to do is mix flour, eggs,milk, and sugar and fry it.

506
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:17,076
Just like Bindeadduk (korean pancake).

507
00:56:17,076 --> 00:57:02,104
That's simple.

508
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:04,639
Your handkerchief . . .

509
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:06,809
I don't need it.

510
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:10,646
I'll return it to you next time.

511
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:14,316
I won't be here again.

512
00:57:14,316 --> 00:58:29,925
It's no longer quiet, thanks to someone.

513
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:33,295
I'm sorry, JanDi.

514
00:58:33,295 --> 00:59:07,129
Forgive me for being a coward.

515
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:09,931
I think it'll be at least $30.

516
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:14,068
Wow, I know the actual price. That's not fair.

517
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:17,416
The express service is a little bit more expensive.

518
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:21,887
Also, look at the condition of these clothes. I've already given you quite the discount only because it's a school uniform.

519
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:28,426
Come on, really. I'm a junior of the dry cleaning business.

520
00:59:28,426 --> 00:59:35,267
If you don't like the price, forget it.Next door is JanDi Dry Cleaner. Go there.

521
00:59:35,267 --> 01:00:01,026
Cmon, Mister. Alright . . . $25!

522
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:10,002
Bon apetit !

523
01:00:10,002 --> 01:00:13,939
Yo, yo, yo! What's up, man?!

524
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:17,743
They only accept one group per week here, so . . .

525
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:22,681
I made reservations a month ago and I'm still waiting, so. . .

526
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:43,402
How did you do it?

527
01:00:43,402 --> 01:00:45,337
This one is better.

528
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:49,808
You're right. It's a beauty.

529
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:52,245
Enough to make your cuisine even finer.

530
01:00:52,245 --> 01:00:59,852
And just who told you that I was a chef?

531
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:15,634
Your . . . delicious-looking hands.

532
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:17,067
Do players know things just by looking at a woman's hand?

533
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:21,473
You need at least to know she's a chefat Michelin in order to be a player.

534
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:37,756
Of course. My bro, yo!

535
01:01:37,756 --> 01:01:43,095
Yeah. Are you doing what I told you to do?

536
01:01:43,095 --> 01:01:57,676
Don't make a mistake and do it correctly. Understand?

537
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,979
Let's eat.

538
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:11,891
Alright. Cheers!

539
01:02:11,891 --> 01:02:13,058
Hey!!

540
01:02:13,058 --> 01:02:14,093
Mom!

541
01:02:14,093 --> 01:02:17,093
You must be crazy! Everyoneis dying to lose weight, but,

542
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:20,499
here you are stuffing your face?!

543
01:02:20,499 --> 01:02:23,035
Will you be happy if I die doing such a worthless thing?

544
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:28,774
Hey! You need to diet and at least have akiller body so the rich boys will notice you!

545
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:32,711
Really! We're not rich nor do we have a goodfamily background nor are we smart!

546
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:34,713
What are you talking about? Dieting is worthless?!

547
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,448
Give me the rice container!

548
01:02:36,448 --> 01:02:40,919
No, I can't. Right now, surviving ismore important than dieting to me.

549
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:46,725
Hey! In this day and age, even swimmersmust be skinny to become stars!

550
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:51,073
Haven't you seen Kim YuNa? You're a young girl,how can you not know the trends?

551
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:53,132
Give me the rice container!

552
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,001
(Mom! I said, I don't want to!)

553
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,735
Give it to me!

554
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,036
Hey, you!

555
01:02:58,036 --> 01:03:00,939
Mom, Kim YuNa is a figure skater.

556
01:03:00,939 --> 01:03:04,343
Kim Yuna is a figure skater, not a swimmer!

557
01:03:04,343 --> 01:03:07,246
Stop! You!

558
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:13,752
Hey! Give up the rice container!

559
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,988
Hey!

560
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:35,374
JanDi? JanDi? The rice container . . . JanDi?

561
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:39,412
Has my stomach gotten bigger?

562
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:42,815
A little bit.

563
01:03:42,815 --> 01:03:47,092
I'm sorry. I haven't been able to take care of you.

564
01:03:47,092 --> 01:03:51,023
I'm only putting up with this because of the swimming pool.

565
01:03:51,023 --> 01:03:55,727
If I had attended this kind of school from the get-go,there's no doubt I would have been in the Olympics.

566
01:03:55,727 --> 01:04:21,072
No doubt at all.

567
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:35,501
What the? What is this? Goo Joon Pyo!

568
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:38,504
Hey! What's going on? You keep on smiling to yourself.

569
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:41,974
She's probably really pissed right about now.

570
01:04:41,974 --> 01:04:44,309
Who?

571
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:48,113
Perhaps, the laundry girl? Still?

572
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:51,283
Wait a minute, how long has it been?

573
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:53,251
It's been over a week.

574
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:57,489
Okay, hand them over, the girls' phone numbers.

575
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,291
She's really something.

576
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:04,396
Wait, isn't she the first girl to really face off with the F4?

577
01:05:04,396 --> 01:05:09,935
What are you saying?It's only because I'm going easy on her.

578
01:05:09,935 --> 01:05:11,637
But, how come JiHoo's not here again?

579
01:05:11,637 --> 01:06:37,956
He's probably sleeping somewhere.

580
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:42,625
Let go!

581
01:06:42,625 --> 99:59:59,999
Be quiet!Let go of me!

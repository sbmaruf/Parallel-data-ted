1
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,770
The officers put a cloth over my face and spun me around to make me dizzy.

2
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,833
Then they dragged and threw me into a 200-liter oil drum.

3
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:42,063
They lit a fire around the oil drum.

4
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:47,296
I tried to crawl out, but they hit me with the butt of a rifle.

5
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:56,266
Finally, I faked fainting. Then they let me crawl out.

6
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:00,763
Once I was out, they all ganged up and beat me.

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,100
They kicked my face, hit my mouth and knocked out two of my  teeth.

8
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,070
They also tortured me by lighting a candle and burning my body.

9
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:20,263
They put ice in a large cylinder, and then they put me inside the cylinder.

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,270
They dunked my head under the water several times. At last I ran out of patience.

11
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:36,666
So I stood up and fought them by pushing them away.

12
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:43,333
But they punched me and broke my eye socket.

13
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:51,303
In the Deep South, many people have told us

14
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,303
that they have had experiences like this

15
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:59,996
But the person who told us this story was a minor.  He was only 16 years old when he was arrested.

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,300
Throughout the 7 years of the southern unrest

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,370
Young people have come under suspicion of being involved in the insurgency00:02:05:24 00:02:10:24 and they must face the same fate as adults.

18
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,303
In another case, there was a minor who was 16 years old

19
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:21,766
when he became a suspect in a bombing case.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,130
I was at school

21
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:35,703
Before I arrived home, a friend came to tell me that there were soldiers surrounding my house

22
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,233
My mom said that the soldiers wanted to see me

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:50,100
They asked me to go to the Army Task Force.

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:03:06,830
My mom had to wait outside. I was interrogated there alone with the officer

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:17,000
The officers told my mom that they would take me to Inkhayuth Army Camp.

26
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,203
I was shocked and then I cried.  I didn't want to go.

27
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:29,696
According to the law and judicial process in general,

28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,070
youths should be given special treatment

29
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,700
as they have not yet reached the age of majority.

30
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:40,766
They are considered to be incapable of taking full responsibility for their actions.

31
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Generally, during investigation and proceedings,

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,600
the minor's parent or guardian is required to be present, even during interrogation.

33
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:55,763
Whatever it takes to result in the minimal impact possible.

34
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,063
To ensure that youth do not feel ashamed or embarassed.

35
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,703
and suffer subsequent mental impacts.

36
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,763
Physical action against youth are out of the question.

37
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:09,063
No force should be used on minors.

38
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,033
Even the use of restraints is prohibited

39
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:17,566
The application of chains, hand restraints, or handcuffs is prohibited.

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,700
The Muslim Attorney Center has never received any information

41
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,066
from the parents or guardians that

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,170
during the investigation process, there was a psychologist present to question the child

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,730
and an interrogator taking notes.

44
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,066
All we have heard is that

45
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:41,633
the interrogating officials directly questioned them.

46
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,430
The statistics of the Muslim Attorney Center

47
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,500
on complaints received from the villagers shows that

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,470
In the Deep South, the number of youths arrested

49
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:57,803
and prosecuted is 55 individuals in 31 cases.

50
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,166
But there is no information that suggests

51
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,036
They have received treatment as juveniles as outlined in the principles

52
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,470
of special care for children and youths.

53
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,030
In addition to not receiving special treatment,

54
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,803
they have also been abused. Human rights activists indicated that

55
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,030
this was partly due to

56
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:21,336
the fact that state officials used their authority according to the special laws that have been declared in the area

57
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:27,133
The problem is with the power specified in the two special laws,

58
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,400
which are the Emergency .Decree and Martial Law.  There's a lot of power

59
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,270
and far-reaching authority.

60
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:40,136
The system of checks and balances to limit the wide-ranging powers

61
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,800
was, however, designed in a

62
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:48,736
way that does not limit abuses.

63
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,733
Therefore, the use of power under both laws

64
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:58,066
lacks the proper checks and balances

65
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:00,766
This leads to the illegitimate use of power

66
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,063
in the form of torture.

67
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,430
On the issue of special treatment for children and youths

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,770
No clear answer could be obtained from state officials

69
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,396
on whether they realize that this problem exists.

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,770
Regarding the issue of torture,

71
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,430
Responsible state officials, such as the military, insisted that there was very little torture.

72
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,803
As for state officials breaking the law

73
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,763
beating people, violating human rights,

74
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,463
during the time that I have been here, there have not been many cases.

75
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:40,803
Those cases that have come up are now going through the criminal justice process.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
Therefore, regarding

77
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,833
state officials beating and torturing those who they arrest,

78
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,063
I maintain that it does not exist.

79
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:52,063
If state officials do it, they must be severely punished.

80
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,470
This is became the Deep South is a special area, where we are trying to solve the problems using special means

81
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,766
Therefore, there can be little or no chance of human rights violations being committed.

82
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,396
If they do occur, then it is a case of an individuals.
But in terms of policy, the policy is 

83
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,766
to prevent it and use other methods.

84
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:17,366
Whether or not this is true, for those who have experienced it

85
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,033
,the attorneys say that

86
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,166
they still have a way to fight and to demand justice.

87
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:30,066
If the question is: "Under what sort of authority did the officials act?"

88
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
I can answer that they have no authority to do so.

89
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:38,603
If the villagers are to bring a case against the officials, they can do so

90
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,463
since the act is considered to be a deprivation of freedom

91
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
and the officials have no authority to detain them.

92
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,436
Martial Laws allows for no more than 7 days of detention.

93
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,430
After 7 days, if further detention is necessary,

94
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,430
a request must be made to the court

95
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,033
for an arrest warrant according to the Emergency Decree.

96
00:07:55,366 --> 00:08:02,366
This is the issue about which we have received a lot of complaints from the villagers

97
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:06,363
including on not being notified of where the suspect would be taken,

98
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,033
detaining suspects for more than 7 days

99
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,503
and not detaining them officially under the Emergency Decree.

100
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,530
But the problem that attorneys themselves admit is that

101
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,503
in many cases, the villagers do not dare to bring a case against state officials.

102
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,370
Human rights activists raise as a concern the issue

103
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:29,066
that these violations then create frustration within the minds of individuals who experience them,

104
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,430
particularly for the youth themselves.

105
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:45,333
I feel very sad that my son was beaten

106
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,996
It's not that I'm not hurt. I am really hurt.

107
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,470
I want to beg the officials to stop doing this.

108
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,030
I feel really sad that there is nothing we can do.

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,700
They are the mighty people, while we are just the small ones.

110
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:14,566
When officers arrest and detain children based only on suspicion,

111
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:22,200
how are the villagers supposed to put their hope in the officials?

112
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:28,603
When something like this is done to the people,

113
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,800
there will be a feeling of mistrust towards the officials

114
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,370
and anger that the officials treat them this way.

115
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,770
Even today, there is anger, but it is hidden inside.

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,670
It cannot be vented out

117
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:57,703
It's hidden in our minds, and we would not dare take vengeance

118
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,430
But instead feel sorry and angry that the officials treated us like this.

119
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,233
Many experts have studied

120
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:25,266
and looked for ways to solve the problems of affected youth.

121
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:27,033
Even though most are not ready to provide information

122
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:32,366
nearly all have expressed concern about the long-term consequences.

123
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:40,203
If the child is not guilty

124
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:45,466
but is accused of being guilty,

125
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:57,100
they will be at risk of being persuaded from the opposite side,

126
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,563
and more easily than other children.

127
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:04,096
Political scientists also commented that

128
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,070
this issue will have long-term consequences on solving the conflict in the area,

129
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
as by their own admission, the Melayu in the Deep South

130
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,000
are already suspicious and afraid of state officials.

131
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,300
It is a long-existing feeling and has been passed on until today.

132
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,770
Today, children and youth

133
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,496
have been directly affected

134
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:30,733
and thus the feeling of uneasiness and dislike is likely to mount up.

135
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,700
At present, I feel that the effect on children who experience this

136
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,030
is that it may facilitate, partially, persuade or push them

137
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,766
to act in another manner

138
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,666
that it may cause them to take actions against the state

139
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:58,733
it may only create further certainty that what they have done was correct.

140
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:04,836
Because no matter what state officials do, it will not  be fair anyways

141
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:10,066
This will be be embedded and make it harder to solve the problem

142
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,236
One approach to solve the problem

143
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:21,596
suggested by the attorneys and human rights activists

144
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:26,266
is that the state should change their working method to take special care of youth.

145
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,730
This does not mean not taking legal action against them,

146
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:34,066
but there should be a process in which these individuals receive special care.

147
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:41,066
I would like to ask security agencies

148
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:48,596
to write a manual outlining policy on the  treatment of youths, children, and women.

149
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:54,333
It should deal with is the method of arrest,

150
00:12:54,433 --> 00:13:03,333
the method of searching, the method of detaining, the conditions of the place of detention,

151
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:08,033
method of interrogation while being detained by military units under martial law,

152
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:12,403
the method of interrogation while being detained under the Emergency Decree,

153
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:15,066
and the conditions of the place of detention.

154
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:21,996
In addition, children and youths should be given the right to have social workers or psychologists

155
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and their parents present during interrogation by officials,

156
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,063
as we have to accept the fact that children and youth

157
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:34,133
have different way of thinking than adults.

158
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,600
If the person interrogating the child is a soldier,

159
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:41,496
the soldier should have received training on children's rights

160
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:46,563
and training on the psychology of interrogating children

161
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,130
The judicial process for children and minors who have committed crimes,

162
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,570
has the objective of rehabilitating juvenile offenders

163
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,463
so that they can return to join society,

164
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,330
and in which the child will feel remorse for their crime and grow in strength

165
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,633
to an adequate extent that they will not re-commit the crime

166
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,400
Therefore, a just and fair criminal justice process for children and youth

167
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:27,533
is important and should be made a reality.

1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,220
Use substitution to
solve for x and y.

2
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:04,845
And we have a system
of equations here.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,370
The first equation is
2y is equal to x plus 7.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,310
And the second equation here
is x is equal to y minus 4.

5
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,387
So what we want to do,
when they say substitution,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,180
what we want to do
is substitute one

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,150
of the variables
with an expression

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,230
so that we have an equation
and only one variable.

9
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:22,444
And then we can solve for it.

10
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:24,131
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,710
So let me rewrite
this first equation.

12
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:29,493
2y is equal to x plus 7.

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,740
And we have the second
equation over here,

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,000
that x is equal to y minus 4.

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,712
So if we're looking
for an x and a y that

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,740
satisfies both constraints,
well we could say, well look,

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,640
at the x and y have to
satisfy both constraints, both

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,840
of these constraints
have to be true.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,070
So x must be equal to y minus 4.

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,720
So anywhere in this top
equation where we see an x,

21
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,345
anywhere we see an
x, we say well look,

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,690
that x by the second constraint
has to be equal to y minus 4.

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,310
So everywhere we see an
x, we can substitute it

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,030
with a y minus 4.

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,150
So let's do that.

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,910
So if we substitute y minus
4 for x in this top equation,

27
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,940
the top equation becomes 2y
is equal to instead of an x,

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,090
the second constraint
tells us that x

29
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,920
needs to be equal to y minus 4.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,480
So instead of an x,
we'll write a y minus 4,

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,390
and then we have a plus 7.

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,420
All I did here is I
substituted y minus 4 for x.

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,190
The second constraint tells
us that we need to do it.

34
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,750
y minus 4 needs to be
equal to x or x needs

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,640
to be equal to y minus 4.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,470
The value here is now
we have an equation,

37
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,090
one equation with one variable.

38
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,250
We can just solve for y.

39
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,380
So we get 2y is equal to y, and
then we have minus 4 plus 7.

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,630
So y plus 3.

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,550
We can subtract y from both
sides of this equation.

42
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,010
The left hand side,
2y minus y is just y.

43
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,800
y is equal to-- these
cancel out. y is equal to 3.

44
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:09,474
And then we could go
back and substitute

45
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,950
into either of these
equations to solve for x.

46
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,570
This is easier right over
here, so let's substitute

47
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,600
right over here. x needs
to be equal to y minus 4.

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,220
So we could say that x
is equal to 3 minus 4

49
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,830
which is equal to negative 1.

50
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,130
So the solution to this system
is x is equal to negative 1

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,000
and y is equal to 3.

52
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:39,212
And you can verify that it
works in this top equation

53
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,880
right over here.

54
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:45,486
2 times 3 is 6 which is indeed
equal to negative 1 plus 7.

55
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,230
Now I want to show you that
over here we substituted--

56
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,830
we had an expression that,
or we had an equation,

57
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,750
that explicitly solved for x.

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,490
So we were able to
substitute the x's.

59
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,270
What I want to show
you is we could

60
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:57,685
have done it the
other way around.

61
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:01,351
We could have solved for y and
then substituted for the y's.

62
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,070
So let's do that.

63
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,109
And we could have substituted
from one constraint

64
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,940
into the other
constraint or vice versa.

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,750
Either way, we would have
gotten the same exact answer.

66
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,500
So instead of saying x
is equal to y minus 4,

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,480
in that second
equation, if we add 4

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,970
to both sides of this equation,
we get x plus 4 is equal to y.

69
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,860
This and this is the
exact same constraint.

70
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,720
I just added 4 to
both sides of this

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,610
to get this
constraint over here.

72
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,490
And now since we've solved
this equation explicitly for y,

73
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,280
we can use the first
constraint, the first equation.

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,430
And everywhere
where we see a y, we

75
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,080
can substitute it with x plus 4.

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
So it's 2 times--
instead of 2 times y,

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,530
we can write 2 times x plus 4.

78
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,940
2 times x plus 4 is
equal to x plus 7.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,540
We can distribute this 2.

80
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,720
So we get 2x plus 8
is equal to x plus 7.

81
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,440
We can subtract x from both
sides of this equation.

82
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,810
And then we can subtract 8 from
both sides of this equation,

83
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,170
subtract 8.

84
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,610
The left hand side,
that cancels out.

85
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,180
We're just left with an x.

86
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,960
On the right hand
side, that cancels out,

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,170
and we are left
with a negative 1.

88
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,160
And then we can
substitute back over here

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,830
we have y is equal to x plus 4,
or so y is equal to negative 1

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,580
plus 4 which is equal to 3.

91
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,520
So once again, we
got the same answer

92
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,720
even though this time we
substituted for y instead

93
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,710
of substituting for x.

94
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,350
Hopefully you found
that interesting.

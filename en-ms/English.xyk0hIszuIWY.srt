00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,080
Welcome to the presentation on
why, not how, borrowing works.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,750
And I think this is very
important because a lot of

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,500
people who even know math
fairly well or have an advanced

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,630
degree still aren't completely
sure on why borrowing works.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,710
That's the focus of
this presentation.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,500
Let's say I have the
subtraction problem

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,450
1,000-- that's a 0.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:31,840
1,005 minus 616.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,050
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to write the same problem

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,300
in a slightly different way.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,640
We could call this
the expanded form.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,080
1,005-- what I'm going to do
is I'm going to separate

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,330
the digits out into
their respective places.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,720
So that is equal to 1,000
plus let's say zero 100's

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,550
plus zero 10's plus 5.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,830
1,005 is just 1,000
plus 0 plus 0 plus 5.

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,340
And then that's minus 616.

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:08,910
So that's minus 600
minus 10 minus 6.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,440
616 could be rewritten
as 600 plus 10 plus 6.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,150
And I put a minus there
because we're subtracting

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,130
the whole thing.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,940
So let's do this problem.

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,220
Well, if you're familiar with
how you borrow is, this 5 is

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,940
less than this 6, so we have to
somehow make this 5 a bigger

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,220
number so that we could
subtract the 6 from it.

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,060
Well, we know from traditional
borrowing that we have to

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,890
borrow 1 from someplace and
make this it into a 15.

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,240
But what I want to see
actually, is understand where

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,530
that 1 or actually where
that 10 comes from.

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,090
Because if you're turning this
5 into a 15 you actually

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,090
have to add 10 to it.

32
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,550
Well, if we look at this top
number, the only place that

33
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,970
a 10 could come from is
here, is from this 1,000.

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,950
But what we're going to do
since this is the 1,000's

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,040
place, instead of borrowing 10
from here, which would make it

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,480
kind of a very messy problem,
I'm going to borrow

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,430
1,000 from here.

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm going to get
rid of this 1,000.

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,110
And I have a 1,000 that
I took from this 1,000.

40
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,740
I have 1,000 now that
I can distribute into

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,790
these 3 buckets.

42
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,360
Into the 100's, 10's
and 1's buckets.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,270
Well, we need 10 here,
so let's put 10 here.

44
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,320
So it's 10 plus 5
is equal to 15.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,040
We got our 15.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,543
If we took 10 from the 1,000
then we have 990 left.

47
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,960
So we could put 900
here and 90 here.

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,250
Notice, we just said-- so we
had 1,000 and we just rewrote

49
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,040
it as 900 plus 90 plus 10.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,670
And we added this 10 to this 5.

51
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,670
And now we could do this
subtraction just how we

52
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,110
would do a normal problem.

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,710
15 minus 6 is 9.

54
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,300
90 minus 10 is 80.

55
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,730
900 minus 600 is 300.

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,550
So 300 plus 80 plus 9 is 389.

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,940
And let's see how we would have
done it traditionally and make

58
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,790
sure that it would have kind of
translated into the same way.

59
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,210
Well, the way I teach it and I
don't know if this is actually

60
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,440
the traditional way of teaching
borrowing, is I say, OK, I need

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,480
to turn this 5 into a 15.

62
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,220
So I have to borrow
a 1 from someplace.

63
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, we know from this side of
the problem that we actually

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,630
borrowed a 10 because that's
why it turned to 15.

65
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,540
If we're going to borrow
1, I'd say, well, can I

66
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,660
borrow the 1 from the 0?

67
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,100
No.

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,730
Can I borrow the 1 from this 0?

69
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,440
No.

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,630
I could borrow it from
here, but I'm borrowing

71
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,980
it from 100, right?

72
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,110
So 100 minus 1 is 99.

73
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,500
So that's the how I do it.

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,560
And I say 15 minus 6 is 9.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,370
9 minus 1 is 8.

76
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,570
And 9 minus 6 is 300.

77
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,600
So this way that I just did it
is clearly faster and, I guess

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,780
you could say it's easier, but
a lot of people might say, well

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,200
Sal, that looks like a
little bit of magic.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,160
You just took that 5, put a 1
on it, and then you borrowed

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,600
a 1 from this 100 here.

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
But really, what I
did is right here.

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,600
I took 1,000 from this 1
and I redistributed that

84
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,050
1,000 amongst the 100's,
10's, and 1's place.

85
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,302
Let me do another example.

86
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:20,425
I think it might make it a
little bit more clearer

87
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,527
of why borrowing works.

88
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,422
Let me do a simpler problem.

89
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,210
I actually started off with a
problem that tends to confuse

90
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,670
the most number of people.

91
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,718
Let's say I had

92
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:38,450
732

93
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:45,290
minus-- Let
me do a fairly simple one.

94
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,958
Minus 23.

95
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,181
Sometimes those 3's
just come out weird.

96
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:55,120
Well, we just learned that's
the same thing as 700 plus

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,240
30 plus 2 minus 20 minus 3.

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,150
Well, we see this 2, 2 is less
than 3, so we can't subtract.

99
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,050
Wouldn't it be great if we
could get a 10 from someplace?

100
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,870
We could get a 10 from here.

101
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,960
We make this into 20 and add
the 10 to the 2 and we get 12.

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,940
And notice, 700 plus 20
plus 12 is still 732.

103
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,420
So we really didn't change
the number up top at all.

104
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,520
We just redistributed its
quantity amongst the

105
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,200
different places.

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,260
And now we're ready
to subtract.

107
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,340
12 minus 3 is 9.

108
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,610
20 minus 20 is 0 and then you
just bring down the 700.

109
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,190
You get 700 plus 0 plus 9,
which is the same thing as 709.

110
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,260
And that's the reason why
this borrowing will work.

111
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, we say, oh, let's
borrow 1 from the 3.

112
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,290
Makes it a 2.

113
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,750
This becomes a 12.

114
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,200
And then we subtract.

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,520
9 0 7.

116
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,370
Let's do another
problem, one last one.

117
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,160
And once again, you don't
have to do it this way.

118
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,850
You don't have to every
time you do a subtraction

119
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,480
problem do it this way.

120
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,520
Although if you ever get
confused, you can do it this

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,700
way and you won't make a
mistake, and you'll actually

122
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,990
understand what you're doing.

123
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,930
But if you're on a test and you
have to do things really fast

124
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,860
you should do it the
conventional way.

125
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,570
But it takes a lot of practice
to make sure you never are

126
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,710
doing something improper.

127
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,390
And that's the problem.

128
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,280
People learn just the rules,
and then they forget the

129
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,980
rules, and then they
forgot how to do it.

130
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,620
If you learn what you're doing,
you'll never really forget it

131
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,544
because it should make
some sense to you.

132
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,702
Let's do another one.

133
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:32,185
If I had 512

134
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:36,179
minus 38

135
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,350
Well, let's keep doing it
that way I just showed you.

136
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:45,020
That's the same thing
as 500 plus 10 plus

137
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,080
2 minus 30 minus 8.

138
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,130
Well, 2 is less than 8.

139
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,290
I need a 10 from someplace.

140
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,290
Well, one option we can
do is we can just get

141
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,600
the 10 from here.

142
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,720
So then that becomes 0.

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,220
And then this will become a 12.

144
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,370
Notice that 500 plus 0 plus
12, same thing as 512 still.

145
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,270
So we could subtract.

146
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,770
12 minus 8 is 4.

147
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,860
But here we see this 0 is less
than 30, so we can't subtract.

148
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,290
But we can borrow from the 500.

149
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,930
Well, all we need is 100, so if
we turn this into 100 then we

150
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,260
took the 100 from the 500.

151
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,070
This becomes 400.

152
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,430
I just rewrote 500
as 400 plus 100.

153
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,340
Now I can subtract.

154
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,510
100 minus 30 is 70.

155
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,790
Bring down the 400.

156
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,560
And this is the
same thing as 474.

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,490
And the way you learn how to do
it in school is you say, oh,

158
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,815
well, 2 is less than 8,
so let me borrow the 1.

159
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:48,930
It becomes 12.

160
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,890
This becomes a 0.

161
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,120
0 is less than 3, so let
me borrow 1 from this 5.

162
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,140
Make this 4.

163
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,710
This becomes 10.

164
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,270
So then you say
12 minus 8 is 4.

165
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,780
10 minus 3 is 7 and
you bring down the 4.

166
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,400
Hopefully what I've done here
will give you an intuition

167
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,510
of why borrowing works.

168
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,760
And this is something that
actually I didn't quite

169
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,690
understand until a while after
I learned how to borrow.

170
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,650
And if you learned this, you'll
realize that what you're doing

171
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,260
here isn't really magic.

172
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,780
And hopefully, you'll never
forget what you're actually

173
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,400
doing and you can always
kind of think about what's

174
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,900
fundamentally happening to
the numbers when you borrow.

175
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,580
I hope you found that useful.

176
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,400
Talk to later.

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,700
Bye.

1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,190
In this video I want to give
you an example of what it

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,170
means to fit data to a line.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,730
Instead of doing my traditional
video using my

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,840
little pen tablet, I'm going to
do it straight on Excel so

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,250
you could see how to do this for
yourself, so if you have

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,090
Excel or some other type of
a spreadsheet program.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,380
We're not going to go
into the math of it.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,540
I really just want you to get
the conceptual understanding

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,840
of what it means to fit data
with line, or do a linear

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,880
regression.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,550
So here, let's just
read the problem.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,550
The following table shows the
median California income--

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,190
remember median is the middle,
the middle California income

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,850
--from 1995 to 2002
as reported by

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,680
the U.S. Census Bureau.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,320
Draw a scatter plot and
find the equation.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,540
What would you expect the median
annual income of a

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,370
California family to be
in the year 2010?

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,970
What are the meanings of the
slope and the y-intercept of

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,580
this problem?

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,050
So the first thing you'd want
to do-- I just copied and

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,060
pasted this image --we have to
get the data in a form that

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,920
the spreadsheet can
understand it.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,830
So let's make some
tables here.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,800
Let's say years since 1995.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,710
Let's make that one column.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,670
Let me make this a
little bit wider.

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,670
Then let me put median income.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,100
This is the median income in
California for a family.

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,560
So we start off with 1 year,
or 0 years since

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,100
1995, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,710
Actually if you want, it'll
figure out the trend if you

33
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,590
just keep going down.

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,650
It'll figure out you're just
incrementing by 1.

35
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,340
Then the income, I'll
just copy in these

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,300
numbers right there.

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:54,710
So that's $53,807, $55,217,
$55,209, $55,415 $63,100,

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:08,680
$63,206, $63,761, and then
we have $65,766.

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,520
So I don't need these
over here.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,380
So I'm going to get
rid of them.

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,810
I can clear them.

42
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,180
So let me make sure I
have enough entries.

43
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:24,040
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,570
6, 7, 8 entries.

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,930
I want to make sure I got my
data right. $53,807, $55,217,

46
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,510
$55,209, 415, 100,
206, 761, 766.

47
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,040
OK, there we go.

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,880
Now you're going to find that
in Excel this is incredibly

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,080
easy if you know what
to click on.

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,430
One, plot this data, create a
scatter plot, and then even

51
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,220
better, create a regression
of that data.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,970
So all you have to do is
you select the data.

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,480
Then you go to insert,
and I'm going to

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,170
insert a scatter plot.

55
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,390
Then you can pick the different

56
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,160
types of scatter plots.

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,820
I just want to plot the data.

58
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,670
There you go.

59
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,470
It plotted the data for me.

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,050
There you go.

61
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,320
If you go by this is the actual
income, and this is by

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,870
year since 1995.

63
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,570
So this is 1995.

64
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,710
It was $53,807.

65
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,370
In 1996 it's $55,217.

66
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,250
So it plotted all the data.

67
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,110
Now what I want to
do is fit a line.

68
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,000
So this isn't exactly a line.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,580
But let's see, if we assume
that a line can model this

70
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,500
data well, I'm going to get
Excel to fit a line for me.

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,580
So what I can do is I have all
of these options up here for

72
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,720
different ways to fit
a line, all of

73
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,710
these different options.

74
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm going to pick
this one here.

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,940
You might not be
able to see it.

76
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,460
It looks like it has a
line between dots.

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,450
It also has fx which tells me
going to tell me the equation

78
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,470
of the line.

79
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,520
So if I click on that,
there you go.

80
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,570
It not only fit, it replotted
that same data

81
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,530
on a different graph.

82
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,830
Let me make it a little
bit bigger.

83
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,930
No, I don't want to that.

84
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,060
Let me make it a little
bit bigger.

85
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,430
We can cover up the data now,
just because I think we know

86
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,410
what's going on.

87
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,460
So let me cover it up
right like that.

88
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,620
So not only did it plot the
various data points, it

89
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,029
actually fit a line to that
data and it gave me the

90
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,355
equation of that line.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,975
Let me see if I can make this
a little bit bigger.

92
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,910
I'll move it out of the way so
you can read it at least.

93
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,400
So it tells me right here, that
the equation for this

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,400
line is y is equal to 1,882.3x
plus 52,847.

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,250
So if you remember what we
know about slope and

96
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:50,660
y-intercept, the y-intercept
is 52,847, which is, if you

97
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,000
use this line as your measure,
where this line intersects at

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,470
year 0, or in 1995.

99
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,830
So if you use this line as a
model, in 1995 the line would

100
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,580
say that you're going
to make $52,847.

101
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,280
The actual data was a little
bit off of that.

102
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,970
It was a little bit
higher, $53,807.

103
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,250
So it was a little bit higher.

104
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,850
But we're trying to get a line
that gets as close as possible

105
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,980
to all of this data.

106
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,530
It's actually trying to minimize
the distance, the

107
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,470
square of the distance, between
each of these points

108
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:20,970
in the line.

109
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,440
We won't go into
the math there.

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,830
But it gave us this
nice equation.

111
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,810
Now we can use this nice
equation to predict things.

112
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,290
If we say that this is a good a
model for the data-- let me

113
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,400
bring this down a little
bit --let's try

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
to answer our question.

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,210
So we drew a scatter plot--
really Excel did it for us.

116
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,000
We found the equation
right there.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,060
They say, what would you expect
the median annual

118
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,490
income of a California family
to be in the year 2010?

119
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,010
So here, we can just use the
equation they gave us.

120
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,770
This right here, was 2002.

121
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,850
So I could write
down the year.

122
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,240
This was the year of 2002.

123
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,490
So the year 2010 is
8 more years.

124
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,350
Let me make a little
column here.

125
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,540
So this is the year,
1995, 1996.

126
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,710
Then Excel will be able to
figure out if I select those,

127
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,950
and I go to this little bottom
right square and I scroll

128
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,920
down, Excel will actually figure
out that I want to

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,980
increment by 1 year
every time.

130
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,670
If I say years since 1995, once
again I can just continue

131
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,550
this trend right here.

132
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,600
So 2010 would be 15 years.

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,660
So we can just apply
this equation.

134
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,760
We could say it's going to be
equal to, according to this

135
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,570
line-- I'm just going to type it
in, hopefully you can read

136
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:51,000
what I'm saying --1,882.3
times x.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,500
x here is the year since 1995.

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,430
I could just select this
cell, or I could type

139
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,320
in the number 15.

140
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,590
That means times this
cell, times 15.

141
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:11,390
Then plus 52,847, plus
that right there.

142
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:17,600
Click enter and it predicts
$81,081.50.

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,610
So if you just continue this
line for another 8 or so

144
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,550
years, it predicts that the
median income in California

145
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,730
for a family will be $81,000.

146
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,270
Anyway, hopefully you found
that interesting.

147
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,340
Spreadsheets are very useful
tools for manipulating data.

148
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,520
It'll give you a sense of why
linear models are interesting,

149
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,130
why lines are interesting, and
how you can actually use these

150
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,600
tools to interpret data and
maybe even extrapolate some

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,370
type of a prediction.

152
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,450
This right here, is an
extrapolation using this

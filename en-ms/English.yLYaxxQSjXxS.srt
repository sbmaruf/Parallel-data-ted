1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,160
Let's graph ourselves
some inequalities.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,050
So let's say I had the
inequality y is less than or

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,520
equal to 4x plus 3.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,500
On our xy coordinate plane, we
want to show all the x and y

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,650
points that satisfy this
condition right here.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,210
So a good starting point might
be to break up this less than

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,570
or equal to, because we
know how to graph y is

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,140
equal to 4x plus 3.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,510
So this thing is the same thing
as y could be less than

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,870
4x plus 3, or y could be
equal to 4x plus 3.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,170
That's what less than
or equal means.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,200
It could be less
than or equal.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,015
And the reason why I did that on
this first example problem

14
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:47,730
is because we know how
to graph that.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,980
So let's graph that.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,170
Try to draw a little bit
neater than that.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,800
So that is-- no, that's
not good.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,460
So that is my vertical
axis, my y-axis.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,920
This is my x-axis,
right there.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
And then we know the
y-intercept, the

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,580
y-intercept is 3.

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,510
So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2,
3-- is on the line.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,405
And we know we have
a slope of 4.

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,430
Which means if we go 1 in the
x-direction, we're going to go

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,980
up 4 in the y.

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,280
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
So it's going to
be right here.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,236
And that's enough
to draw a line.

29
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:35,210
We could even go back
in the x-direction.

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,290
If we go 1 back in the
x-direction, we're

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,500
going to go down 4.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,930
1, 2, 3, 4.

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,480
So that's also going to be
a point on the line.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,670
So my best attempt at drawing
this line is going to look

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,590
something like-- this
is the hardest part.

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,610
It's going to look something
like that.

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,270
That is a line.

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,470
It should be straight.

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,240
I think you get the idea.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,540
That right there is the graph
of y is equal to 4x plus 3.

41
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,440
So let's think about what it
means to be less than.

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,789
So all of these points
satisfy this

43
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,750
inequality, but we have more.

44
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,410
This is just these
points over here.

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,830
What about all these where
y ix less than 4x plus 3?

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,790
So let's think about
what this means.

47
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,410
Let's pick up some
values for x.

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,140
When x is equal to 0,
what does this say?

49
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,390
When x is equal to 0, then that
means y is going to be

50
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,150
less than 0 plus 3.
y is less than 3.

51
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,620
When x is equal to negative 1,
what is this telling us?

52
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,590
4 times negative 1 is negative
4, plus 3 is negative 1. y

53
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,840
would be less than negative 1.

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,950
When x is equal to 1, what
is this telling us?

55
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,110
4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7.

56
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,340
So y is going to
be less than 7.

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,130
So let's at least try
to plot these.

58
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,670
So when x is equal to-- let's
plot this one first. When x is

59
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,805
equal to 0, y is less than 3.

60
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,230
So it's all of these points
here-- that I'm shading in in

61
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,310
green-- satisfy that
right there.

62
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,200
If I were to look at this one
over here, when x is negative

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,140
1, y is less than negative 1.

64
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,850
So y has to be all of these
points down here.

65
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,470
When x is equal to 1,
y is less than 7.

66
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,500
So it's all of these
points down here.

67
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,960
And in general, you take any
point x-- let's say you take

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,020
this point x right there.

69
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,980
If you evaluate 4x plus 3,
you're going to get the point

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,120
on the line.

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,950
That is that x times 4 plus 3.

72
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,860
Now the y's that satisfy it,
it could be equal to that

73
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,100
point on the line, or it
could be less than.

74
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,840
So it's going to go
below the line.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,870
So if you were to do this for
all the possible x's, you

76
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,130
would not only get all the
points on this line which

77
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,990
we've drawn, you would get all
the points below the line.

78
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,279
So now we have graphed
this inequality.

79
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,480
It's essentially this line, 4x
plus 3, with all of the area

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,490
below it shaded.

81
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,530
Now, if this was just a less
than, not less than or equal

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,670
sign, we would not include
the actual line.

83
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,090
And the convention to do that is
to actually make the line a

84
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,860
dashed line.

85
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,880
This is the situation if we were
dealing with just less

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,690
than 4x plus 3.

87
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,410
Because in that situation, this
wouldn't apply, and we

88
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,620
would just have that.

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,550
So the line itself wouldn't have
satisfied it, just the

90
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,010
area below it.

91
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,190
Let's do one like that.

92
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:06,230
So let's say we have y is
greater than negative x

93
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,530
over 2 minus 6.

94
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,940
So a good way to start-- the
way I like to start these

95
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,830
problems-- is to just graph
this equation right here.

96
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,780
So let me just graph-- just for
fun-- let me graph y is

97
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,200
equal to-- this is the same
thing as negative 1/2 minus 6.

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,890
So if we were to graph it, that
is my vertical axis, that

99
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,130
is my horizontal axis.

100
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,920
And our y-intercept
is negative 6.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,170
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

102
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,020
So that's my y-intercept.

103
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,960
And my slope is negative 1/2.

104
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,390
Oh, that should be an x there,
negative 1/2 x minus 6.

105
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,950
So my slope is negative 1/2,
which means when I go 2 to the

106
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,395
right, I go down 1.

107
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:58,775
So if I go 2 to the right,
I'm going to go down 1.

108
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,870
If I go 2 to the left, if
I go negative 2, I'm

109
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,880
going to go up 1.

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,040
So negative 2, up 1.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,530
So my line is going
to look like this.

112
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,200
My line is going to
look like that.

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
That's my best attempt
at drawing the line.

114
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
So that's the line
of y is equal to

115
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,080
negative 1/2 x minus 6.

116
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,730
Now, our inequality is not
greater than or equal, it's

117
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,320
just greater than negative x
over 2 minus 6, or greater

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,850
than negative 1/2 x minus 6.

119
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,230
So using the same logic as
before, for any x-- so if you

120
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,070
take any x, let's say that's
our particular x we want to

121
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,260
pick-- if you evaluate negative
x over 2 minus 6,

122
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,970
you're going to get that
point right there.

123
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,720
You're going to get the
point on the line.

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,620
But the y's that satisfy this
inequality are the y's

125
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,650
greater than that.

126
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,920
So it's going to be not that
point-- in fact, you draw an

127
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,930
open circle there-- because you
can't include the point of

128
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,750
negative 1/2 x minus 6.

129
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,750
But it's going to be all the
y's greater than that.

130
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,670
That'd be true for any x.

131
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,900
You take this x.

132
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,260
You evaluate negative 1/2 or
negative x over 2 minus 6,

133
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,660
you're going to get this
point over here.

134
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,100
The y's that satisfy it are
all the y's above that.

135
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,660
So all of the y's that satisfy
this equation, or all of the

136
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,990
coordinates that satisfy this
equation, is this entire area

137
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,310
above the line.

138
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,070
And we're not going to
include the line.

139
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,300
So the convention is to make
this line into a dashed line.

140
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,850
And let me draw-- I'm trying
my best to turn it into a

141
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,430
dashed line.

142
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,070
I'll just erase sections of
the line, and hopefully it

143
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,160
will look dashed to you.

144
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,590
So I'm turning that solid line
into a dashed line to show

145
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,500
that it's just a boundary, but
it's not included in the

146
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,210
coordinates that satisfy
our inequality.

147
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,760
The coordinates that satisfy our
equality are all of this

148
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,430
yellow stuff that I'm shading
above the line.

149
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,260
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.

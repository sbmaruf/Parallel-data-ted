1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Why grow homes? Because we can.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And there's a cause for that, all right.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As an architect, I have to confront something like this.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So what's a technology that will allow us

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to make ginormous houses?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we do something different

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
than what we did in the past;

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We use CNC to make scaffolding

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
into a specific geometry

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is the landscape, right?

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And you can have a hundred million of these homes,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and it's great because they suck carbon.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They're perfect.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Imagine pre-growing a village --

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it takes about seven to 10 years --

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and everything is green.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So not only do we do the veggie house,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to put in a molecular cell biology lab

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and tissue engineering

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and start thinking about what the future would be

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
if architecture and biology became one.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And what we do is we grow

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
extracellular matrix from pigs.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We use a modified inkjet printer,

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and we print geometry.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
handbags, etc.,

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
where no sentient creature is harmed.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So our theory is that eventually

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we should be doing this with homes.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So here is a typical stud wall,

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
an architectural construction,

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and this is a section

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
of our proposal for a meat house,

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
cilia for dealing with wind loads

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
(Laughter)

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And we know it's incredibly ugly.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but we kind of chose this shape.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We had a big show in Prague,

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so religion can confront the house of meat.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
(Applause)

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Another is to change our lifestyles.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
can actually be measured now.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This was figured out by Robin Williams

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a few years before the rest of us.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, there's some things that you can do

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to make your brain grow new brain cells.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
alcohol in moderation, stress management

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and cannabinoids found in marijuana.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm just the messenger.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
(Laughter)

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What were we just talking about?

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
(Laughter)

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And other things that can make it worse,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that can cause you to lose brain cells.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Your heart gets more blood flow.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
after only a year become measurably less clogged.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the blue means no blood flow.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
simply by making these changes.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
70 percent in the group that made these changes,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
These differences were highly significant.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so you increase sexual potency.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
by the Department of Health Services,

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
can cause a heart attack or a stroke,

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but it also causes impotence.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How sexy is that?

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now we're also about to publish a study --

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is what's called a heat map --

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
turning off the disease-promoting genes.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And so these findings I think are really very powerful,

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
giving many people new hope and new choices.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
that are giving you your genetic profiles,

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
than we might have made otherwise,

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
we can actually change how our genes are expressed.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
(Applause)

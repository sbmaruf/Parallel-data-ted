00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,960
In the last video, we divided
100 into 99.061, and we did it

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,770
the manual way.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,510
We did it the long
division way.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,690
In this video, I just want to
show you a quick shortcut

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,900
because we're dividing something
by a power of ten.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,690
If I have 99.061, if I multiply
by a power of ten,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,080
I'm going to make the
number bigger.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,770
Every time I multiply by 10, the
decimal would shift to the

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,250
right by one spot.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,320
So we could say, 99.061
times 10 is going

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,770
to be equal to 990.61.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,060
Notice we just moved
the decimal over to

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,670
the right by one.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,590
If I were to do-- I'll just
arbitrarily switch colors--

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,670
99.061 divided by 10, we're
going to shift the decimal in

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,830
the other direction.

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,600
This is going to be 9.9061.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,180
So when we divide by 100, we're
dividing by 10 twice.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,340
We're shifting to
the left twice.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:17,150
So if we start with 99.061
divided by 100-- let me just

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,760
write it like this.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
We've already written
the problem.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,570
If we want to divide this by
100, moving it one spot to the

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,340
left will divide it by 10, and
then moving another spot to

25
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,930
the left will divide
it by 10 again.

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:41,400
So 99.061 divided by 100 is
going to be equal to 0.99061.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,560
We're just going to shift the
decimal to the left by two.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,920
And we might want to put a
leading zero here, just so it

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,220
makes it a little bit
easier to read.

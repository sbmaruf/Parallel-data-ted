1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570


2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,890
Which whole numbers will make
this statement true?

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,590
We have the statement here where
we have some brackets

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,930
are less than 7.

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,920
So we just have to figure out
which whole numbers, if we put

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,900
them here, are really
less than 7.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,010
So let's draw a number line
and let's go up to 7.

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,590
When we talk about whole
numbers, we're talking about

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,380
the non-negative numbers or
numbers that start at zero,

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,440
and they aren't fractions.

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,860
Let me draw them on
a number line.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,960
Let's say we have this number
line right here.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,850
We'll start at 0.

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,350
You could go below 0.

15
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,490
There are negative numbers, but
we're not going to concern

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,360
ourselves with them right now.

17
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:43,720
So you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7-- I'll go up a little

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
bit-- 8, 9.

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,320
Now we want all of the numbers
that are less than 7.

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,850
That's what that means.

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,840
We could write it like this.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,630
Question mark is less than
7, and what would satisfy

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,160
question mark?

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,300
The hardest thing about these
greater than or less than is

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,830
remembering what the
symbol means.

26
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,120
We have the smaller side
pointing to the question mark,

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,210
so that is the smaller number.

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,590
We have the larger side of the
symbol pointing to the 7, so 7

29
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,940
is going to be the larger
of the two numbers.

30
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,240
So what numbers satisfy that?

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,720
Well, anything below 7.

32
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,900
Any whole number below 7.

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,290
So if we look at 7 on the number
line, what are all of

34
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,270
the whole numbers that are below
7, that are less than 7?

35
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,720
Well, we have a 6, we have 5,
we have 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0.

36
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,770
So you could put any of these
numbers here and the statement

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,300
would be true.

38
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,650
You could write 0
is less than 7.

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,350
That's true.

40
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,810
You could write 3
is less than 7.

41
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,780
That's true.

42
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,850
You could write 6 is less than
7, and that would be true.

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,050
You could not write that 8 is
less than 7, so 8 would not

44
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,790
satisfy this.

45
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,500
This is not true.

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,640
This is not true, so we
cannot write that.

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,950
8 is greater than 7.

48
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,134

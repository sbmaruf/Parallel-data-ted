Episode 11

3
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:46,147
She talks in her sleep now . I'm never going to get sleep. What the heck am I going to do ?

4
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:51,813
That's right

5
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:56,633
I spent the whole night with Seung Jo.

6
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:03,184
You mean that when I wake up, Seung Jo will be in the same bed as me.

7
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:17,843
Seung Jo.

8
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:24,667
It's time to wake up.

9
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,967
Did you sleep well?

10
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,667
Good morning.

11
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,333
It was a disaster sleeping with you last night.

12
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,047
Why?

13
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,548
Because of your terrible sleeping habits.

14
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:45,367
What are you talking about? I'm a totally still sleeper.

15
00:02:45,367 --> 00:03:25,007
Stop kidding me.

16
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,075
Wear this one.

17
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:42,467
I don't want to.

18
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:45,498
Are you just going to stare at me like that?

19
00:03:45,498 --> 00:04:08,467
Ah, sorry...

20
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,005
You act like it's your own home.

21
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,167
Really?

22
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:17,867
Is that so?

23
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:21,000
en espaÃ±ol

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,133
it feels different when I'm staying in Seung Jo's apartment.

25
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:34,005
It feels like we're living together.

26
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:37,533
What kind of fantasy are you having now?

27
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:49,001
Don't overdo it.

28
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:56,003
He's never been late for work.

29
00:04:56,003 --> 00:05:12,867
What's the matter?

30
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,015
" Oh Han Ni and Baek Seung Jo spent the night together"

31
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,633
Did they really spend the night together?

32
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,004
You know that girl from the tennis club.

33
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:21,667
Oh her?

34
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:26,565
Hey! Baek Seung Jo! Since when did you...?Lucky you

35
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:31,815
Tell us, tell us the details. So how was it?

36
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:45,005
I said to give us some details.

37
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:46,008
Mother!

38
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:48,949
What's your problem?

39
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,664
Why are you calling me "Mother"? You're embar . . .

40
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:53,000
Mother!

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,283
How can you tell so quickly?

42
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,567
The way you disguise yourself so thatone can tell in one look...The way you disguise yourself so thatone can tell in one look...

43
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,006
please do something about it!

44
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:08,633
And what do you think you're doing coming all the way to my school and causing all this?

45
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,009
Ha Ni, how are you feeling, after being sick and all?

46
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,733
I'm alright now.

47
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,467
Really? That's a relief.

48
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:20,033
Alright...So how was it?

49
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:20,567
Huh?

50
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:23,667
How was it...?

51
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:27,007
Your voice is very loud.

52
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:32,000
It was nothing special.

53
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,004
Ah...really?

54
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:40,669
Seung Jo is that type of man? That's unbelievable.

55
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,006
Oh yes! Ha Ni, did you give him the chocolates?

56
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:44,009
Right! The chocolates!

57
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:49,233
The chocolates..

58
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,567
I lost the chocolates!

59
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,633
What do you mean you "lost" them?

60
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,367
It is a sign of love.

61
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,933
Where did it go?

62
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:00,733
What to do? Baek Seung Jo's chocolates!

63
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:06,076
Do you see me volumizing the ends?! Isn't it off the hook! I'm really good at it!

64
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:14,077
I'll make sure your hair isn't damaged and-- Welcome!

65
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:19,002
Bong Joon Gu...

66
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,467
What? Slept together?

67
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,667
Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni?

68
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,002
My feet just dragged me here...

69
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:32,008
When I spoke to Ha Ni not long ago she didn't tell me anything like that.

70
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:38,067
There is no way Ha Ni won't tell me the big news.

71
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:44,333
Weren't you mistaken and went around in the rain for nothing?

72
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:51,867
From a kiss to sleeping together...that's great!

73
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:54,567
Now everything is over. It's over.

74
00:07:54,567 --> 00:08:03,067
Ah... Joon Gu... Joon... Bong Joon G...

75
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,794
Nothing happened you said?

76
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,005
Yeah...

77
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:10,055
A man and a woman spent a whole night together,

78
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:14,633
How is it that nothing happened?

79
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:26,433
Nothing happened.

80
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:33,032
Can I tell her?Jung Ju Ri

81
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:45,267
You're early today.

82
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:49,867
The school's a bit talkative today.

83
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:54,533
You know nothing happened.

84
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:58,733
True..

85
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:03,067
There is no way.

86
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,006
Seung Jo...

87
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:31,467
Do you want to get dinner together after class?

88
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,333
I think I'm going to die because of this upcoming test.

89
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,033
Min Ah, you don't study for exams?

90
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:42,567
There's no way I can study for all 12 subjects.

91
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:50,001
If there's no way for Dok Go Min Ah, then it's absolutely impossible for Oh Ha Ni.

92
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:55,767
Fine, I've made a decision. I'm only going to study for English.

93
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,133
Only English?

94
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:57,767
Why?

95
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:06,233
It's the only subject I'm taking with Seung Jo, so if I fail that as well, then it's all over.

96
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:10,467
No matter what I get on the other subjects, I'm definitely going to pass English.

97
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,933
Oh Ha Ni, you are now in study mode.

98
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:27,066
Ah! I don't have much time. I'm leaving.

99
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:31,675
It's raining...

100
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,556
Aigoo. Why is it raining like this?

101
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:37,071
Oh! Really.

102
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:41,072
Oh, aren't you the one who works at the restaurant?

103
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:47,613
Oh right! What are you doing here? Are you waiting for someone?

104
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,038
Looks like you're not in a good mood.

105
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:52,828
It's not that I'm in a bad mood.

106
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:55,208
I am trying to give up my love

107
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,073
My heart feels like it's breaking apart.

108
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,901
What do you mean give up on love?

109
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,666
You shouldn't give up on love.

110
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,706
No, certainly not.

111
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:04,767
I've only been following for the past few years.

112
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,081
I never even went on a date with her.

113
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:09,209
This is a very serious matter.

114
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:15,014
Have you tried confessing your feelings?

115
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:16,229
Confessing?

116
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,049
Oh, so you don't know how to confess.

117
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:20,285
Look

118
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,396
This is how you do it.

119
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:25,308
You grab the girl like this.

120
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:29,069
You pull her like this,

121
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:32,436
push her up against a wall, and when she looks up,

122
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:33,494
then you say,

123
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:37,275
" If you can forget me then go ahead," and suddenly kiss her.

124
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:38,652
If you do it like this

125
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:40,579
the girl won't even be able to think

126
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:41,826
When they're flustered,

127
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,782
they'll suddenly have feelings for you!

128
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,811
That's how you confess.

129
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,588
That's right! A confession.

130
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,307
I won't die from it, so

131
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:51,008
let's try it.

132
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:56,599
Hyung-nim, thank you!

133
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,528
Oh right!

134
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:41,855
Timing is very important thing, timing!

135
00:12:41,855 --> 00:13:51,795
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

136
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:59,599
Ha Ni, you're here!

137
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:02,432
Your face doesn't look good.

138
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:05,368
Even when it's exam week,

139
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:07,079
you two look fine.

140
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,087
Usually,

141
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:12,041
you're supposed to take tests with your every day capabilities.

142
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,738
If you try to study it all at once, then how could they test what you've learned?

143
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:19,121
Then the test would just be some kind of photographic memory test or something.

144
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,376
Isn't that right Seung Jo?

145
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,815
How did you do on the other tests?

146
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:26,338
So so.

147
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:29,363
I will really do my best on the test, so that we can

148
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,546
attend the same class next semester together...

149
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:35,857
This English test is famous for being hard. What are you going to do?

150
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:40,087
Weren't you hitting it pretty close in the last test too?

151
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,725
Ha Ni,

152
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:46,755
it would be better if you attend this same class for another year.

153
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,032
You know that girl you saw before,

154
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:51,422
Ji Yeon, who Seung Jo and I were tutoring.

155
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:54,078
She's going to be attending our school.

156
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,435
How about you attend the same class next year?

157
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,216
Ha Ni,

158
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,266
why are you glaring at me like that?

159
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:23,914
Your eyes will burst.

160
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:26,693
This is the first time

161
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,876
I'm taking a test together with Seung Jo.

162
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:58,319
Seung Jo looks greatest when he is solving questions.

163
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,006
Why are you not finishing?

164
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,454
I'm done.

165
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:06,437
There is still 40 minutes left! Already?

166
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:12,957
Seung Jo, wait for a second.Let's go out together.

167
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:16,015
It was surprisingly easy, right?

168
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:56,717
Oh, you didn't even write anything! What are you going to do?

169
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,543
I came because

170
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,325
I have something to tell you.

171
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,754
Oh, really?

172
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,674
What is it?

173
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,562
Even if you don't tell me anything,

174
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:10,469
I know everything.

175
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:15,579
You probably don't know how much my heart ached that night.

176
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:21,006
But no matter how much I thought about it, it didn't seem right.

177
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,638
To be honest,

178
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,351
I can't bring myself

179
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:39,136
to give up on you Ha Ni.

180
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,137
But still,

181
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:46,252
once a guy pulls out his sword, he's got to see it till the very end.

182
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:50,425
I'm just going to be understanding about everything that's happened.

183
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,252
Ha Ni, I

184
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:54,969
thought about giving you up,

185
00:17:54,969 --> 00:18:00,013
but it won't go the way I want.

186
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,135
You don't have to be sorry.

187
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,099
How is it your fault?

188
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:07,699
It's that fool Baek Seung Jo that's trying to seduce you!

189
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,419
Quite soon

190
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,458
I'm going to beat the crap out of that Baek Seung Jo.

191
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,642
So,

192
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,792
forget everything

193
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,991
and let's start over,

194
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:27,094
Ha Ni.

195
00:18:27,094 --> 00:18:32,001
Ha Ni?

196
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,791
Ha Ni, are you sleeping?!

197
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,555
Hey!

198
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:41,509
Hey, Bong Joon Gu.

199
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:47,505
Hurry.

200
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:48,056
What?

201
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:51,404
Hey, Bong Joon Gu. What are you trying to start over?

202
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:53,842
That night, nothing happened between them.

203
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:57,972
He didn't touch a hair on her.

204
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:58,947
Really?

205
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:02,244
Yeah, really.

206
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:05,063
Man, that Baek Seung Jo is a real gentleman!

207
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:08,606
Wow, you're even complimenting Baek Seung Jo.

208
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:13,165
Ha Ni!

209
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:27,807
Let's go!

210
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:30,069
Oh Ha Ni.

211
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:47,135
Let's start dating.

212
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,009
Hey, Gi Tae,

213
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:52,009
when did you arrive?

214
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,559
You've come back?

215
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,404
Hey, go and practice.

216
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,234
What are you saying so early in the morning? Ha Ni's got someone.

217
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,356
It's not a joke.

218
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:08,492
I am Kyung Su's friend, and starting next semester

219
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:10,589
I'll be attending the same school

220
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:20,213
I'm Kim Gi Tae.Nice to meet you.

221
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:23,063
Since you guys are here already, say hello.

222
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:25,434
He is your Tennis club Sunbae,

223
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,064
His name is Kim Gi Tae. Greet him.

224
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:29,576
- Hello.- Hello

225
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:34,015
If you're done, go and practiceGo, go.

226
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,797
You're a funny guy.

227
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:38,112
Since when do you know Ha Ni,

228
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,163
that you want to go out with her as soon as you met her?

229
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,742
Haven't you heard?

230
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,097
Oh Ha Ni and Baek Seung Jo.

231
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,682
I know.

232
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,064
Ha Ni likes Baek Seung Jo, right?

233
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:50,078
Ever since high school, I've watched over those two.

234
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:50,719
Huh?

235
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,416
Then, why?

236
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,139
Especially since the two of you aren't dating,

237
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:57,016
that means that I too,

238
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:58,771
have a chance.

239
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:01,943
Yes? Suddenly...

240
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:04,722
Was it too fast?

241
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,191
OK, good.

242
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:08,816
This week-end,

243
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:10,656
let's go on a date.

244
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:13,214
You need to get to know me as well.

245
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:15,954
That's how it's going to be.

246
00:21:15,954 --> 00:21:17,684
Then, see you later.

247
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,683
I'm leaving.

248
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:23,554
Before leaving, let's have a game.

249
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:33,067
Next time.

250
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,167
She totally froze up.

251
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:40,033
Hey Ha Ni.Isn't he really good looking?

252
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:45,167
When we first joined this school,Gi Tae and I were very popular with the female Sunbaes,

253
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,567
Him for his looks, and me for my charisma.

254
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:52,567
But that Gi Tae, to you . . .

255
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:56,000
You punks! You won't go practice?!

256
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,014
It feels weird.

257
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:02,533
I was very surprised.

258
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:06,008
This is the first time in my life I have been confessed to this way.

259
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,004
This is amazing.

260
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:12,967
Is it real? Did it really happen? Did he ask you out?

261
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:20,333
Isn't this the first time in your life? You've always been the one doing the chasing!

262
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:24,633
I heard he was a sunbae? Who might he be? I'm curious!

263
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:28,567
How is he? Is he tall? What about his looks?! Is he good looking?

264
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:32,008
Well, a little.

265
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:38,965
You're embarrassed! He must be good looking.

266
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,933
Hey, Baek Seung Jo knows too?

267
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:47,833
Right right.Does Baek Seung Jo know too?

268
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:53,933
I'm saying, Ha Ni got confessed to by a really cool guy.

269
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:57,112
Really?

270
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,008
So?

271
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:08,967
So if you don't do something, Ha Ni and that guy might get together...

272
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,967
You're not worried?

273
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,007
You sure do get excited over nothing.

274
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:16,767
That's what you wanted to say?

275
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:27,964
I'm not worried.

276
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:30,667
Oh? really?

277
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,007
He wants to date you?!

278
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,667
Yes.

279
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,233
But it's not a big deal.

280
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,004
Omo!

281
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:39,018
Who would like you?

282
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:42,533
How can he be just like his brother!?

283
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,007
The thing I've been fearing has finally come.

284
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,000
Someone as cute as Ha Ni...

285
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,004
I knew I would lose her like this soon enough.

286
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:55,167
This is all because Seung Jo is dragging his feet.

287
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,001
Stop it dear. Don't get so worked up.

288
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:00,444
Stuff like this is all the free will of the person.

289
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:06,067
What kind of guy is he?

290
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,567
It's a sunbae and he's one year older than me. We're in the same grade.

291
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:14,033
Sunbae?!? My god the most dangerous person is a male Sunbae!

292
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:17,855
I don't really remember his face.

293
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:22,533
Ha Ni, haven't you been tricked by a player?

294
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:27,467
You're all naive and go around smiling at any old guy right?!

295
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,001
No, dad. I'm not like that.

296
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,933
I have to do whatever I can.

297
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:41,672
I can't leave it like this.

298
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:44,867
It's gotten much bigger than I expected.

299
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:51,301
Today has been eventful.

300
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:57,001
Still, he confessed to me knowing I like Seung Jo

301
00:24:57,001 --> 00:25:03,567
He's a bold person.

302
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,844
How does he look?

303
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:09,003
I didn't get to take a good look.

304
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:23,267
How did his face look?

305
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:33,033
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

306
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,533
Hey you.

307
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:43,005
I'll see you later.

308
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:46,008
Oh Ha Ni.

309
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,633
Why did you come...?

310
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:52,633
You can't forget my face.

311
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:57,001
So I came to show you my face.

312
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:00,009
Hey, Baek Seung Jo is working part time at a restaurant?

313
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:02,006
Huh?Yes.

314
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:07,409
Last time I went, you were there too.

315
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:09,133
I heard that you went there everyday.

316
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:11,167
I went a few times

317
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:15,567
You know, I'm pretty damn smart too.

318
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:20,233
Of course I wasn't as visible due to the all around perfect Baek Seung Jo.

319
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:23,033
Then are you approaching me because of Seung Jo...

320
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:32,167
Of course I was provoked a bit by Baek Seung who's good at everything whether it's studying or tennis.

321
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,006
As I was worrying about Baek Seung Jo,

322
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:37,009
it's true that I saw you following him around everywhere.

323
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:43,067
Suddenly without me even realizing it, little by little,

324
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:45,167
I started looking at you.

325
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,433
Ah, yes.

326
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:51,067
You would still step forward despite being rejected by Baek Seung Jo over and over again.

327
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:55,367
You could say I was touched by that, Oh Ha Ni.

328
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:58,009
Anyway I was pulled towards you.

329
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:02,005
Hey, just go out with me.

330
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:08,433
Don't waste your precious youth on Baek Seung Jo, when you don't even know if he will turn around towards you.

331
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:13,733
Have an amusing campus life with me. What do you think?

332
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:17,767
Even so, I...

333
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:20,233
I was wondering who it was. It's Gi Tae Sunbae!

334
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, Yoon Hae Ra.

335
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,003
Do you know each other?

336
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:27,003
I met him often during the tennis matches.

337
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:29,833
But do you know each other?

338
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,333
I am going out with Oh Ha Ni.

339
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:36,333
Ah, that's not true.

340
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,867
So, you're going to give up Seung Jo now?

341
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,067
Of course!

342
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,733
Don't just say whatever you want!

343
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:47,833
Before Kyung Su Sunbae, and now Gi tae Sunbae. You're so popular Oh Ha Ni!

344
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,233
You suit each other well.

345
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,000
See you later at the club room.

346
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Ok.

347
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,007
See you later.

348
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:56,267
Sunbae, continue what you were doing.

349
00:27:56,267 --> 00:28:04,933
Make sure to keep it moving straight forward!

350
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,005
I'll be going first.

351
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:10,006
See you later.

352
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:28,733
Oh, I can't believe it!

353
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:32,633
His face is about a... 85%

354
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:39,000
He seems to have a bright personality and he's enthusiastic.

355
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,667
If he's a law major...

356
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,867
A future politician or lawyer?

357
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:45,009
Mother.

358
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:51,267
Oh!

359
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:54,005
This...

360
00:28:54,005 --> 00:29:00,000
Did you possibly go to school to see that sunbae?

361
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,267
He's Seung Jo's rival, so we need to analyze him real well and plan something.

362
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:16,533
The way I see it, this guy is much cuter than Seung Jo.

363
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:19,009
What to do?

364
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:25,167
If this guy takes your heart,

365
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:28,633
What would I do?!

366
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:33,003
Mother.

367
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:34,933
Not to worry.

368
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:40,007
I will always think of Seung Jo only.

369
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:41,467
Ha Ni.

370
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:44,004
I'll go reject him right now!

371
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:48,567
I'm deeply touched!

372
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,767
Oh wait! No, don't go.

373
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,433
Ha Ni you shouldn't reject him.

374
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,567
Yes?

375
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:58,006
Let's try to make Seung Jo jealous.

376
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,833
Eh! That's impossible.

377
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,133
No, no.

378
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,899
He may be acting so cocky all the time,

379
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:10,008
but just wait and see. Seung Jo will definitely feel himself being pulled towards you!

380
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,767
Because you're always next to him,

381
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:17,467
he is relaxed and doing other things!

382
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:22,009
But if you suddenly show him another side of you, he will notice his feelings for you.

383
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:32,667
Will it be alright to use such a dangerous plan like this?

384
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,767
Will it be okay?

385
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:38,733
Will Seung Jo really be jealous?

386
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:45,433
You don't have to be thinking like that.

387
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:46,733
Do well.

388
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:51,733
Gi Tae sunbae is smart, and is very popular with the ladies.

389
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:55,004
But seeing that he has an interest in you,

390
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:58,933
he does have really unique taste then.

391
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:03,833
That's a relief. Then again, one man's trash is another man's treasure.

392
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,433
What are you talking about?

393
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:09,009
Though I'm like this, aside from you, I'm quite popular with the guys.

394
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:15,233
Maybe he's got a bad eye or a real weirdo.

395
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,133
That person is just as smart as you are

396
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:20,005
and as good looking as you.

397
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:26,033
Most of all, compared to you, he is really nice to girls.

398
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,533
I'm in a good mood,

399
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:32,067
because Ha Ni thinks of me like that.

400
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:37,267
Well Baek Seung Jo, seeing how it is, why don't you pass Ha Ni on to me?

401
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:45,004
So it was you Sunbae. There's no need to pass her on. It's not like she belongs to me. Do as you please.

402
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:52,167
What did he say? I can't believe him.

403
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:52,867
Gi Tae Sunbae

404
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,733
Oh yes princess?

405
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,167
Where are we going on this Sunday's date?

406
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,009
I'm okay with anything.

407
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:03,006
Whether it's the mountain or the sea, I'll go anywhere.

408
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:07,002
Sunbae, Congratulations. I'm serious!

409
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:13,000
Seung Jo!

410
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,001
If it goes on like this, I'm really going to cheat on him!

411
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:28,035
I won't regret it!

412
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:31,254
What would you like to order?

413
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:33,625
One ice tea.

414
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,623
Do you want to kill time with that again?

415
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,309
Today, I didn't came here to see you.

416
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:44,775
I'm here for an other appointment.

417
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:45,982
Ha Ni, I'm sorry.

418
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:48,534
On the way here, there was a traffic jam.

419
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,751
Did you wait long?

420
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:52,387
No, I just arrived here, too.

421
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,062
Oh, hi Baek Seung Jo. One coffee for me, with ice.

422
00:32:56,062 --> 00:33:00,075
Yes. Ice tea and iced coffee.

423
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:06,873
Wait for a moment please.

424
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:11,545
Today, it's finally the much anticipated Date day.

425
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,072
The weather today was really nice!

426
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:14,975
What would you like to do?

427
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:18,994
Well, I don't really know.

428
00:33:18,994 --> 00:33:21,013
Perhaps, is this your first date?

429
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:25,756
Huh? No way. I've gone on dates before.

430
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:29,657
With Baek Seung Jo?

431
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:45,418
Yes.

432
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:49,357
Then again, it's our time to have all the fun in the world.

433
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:52,096
From now on, I'll take you out a lot.

434
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,958
Yes.

435
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,519
Where should we go?

436
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:06,621
There's this new rollercoaster, which is really fast.Should we go to the amusement park?

437
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:10,254
It sounds fun! What should we do afterwards?

438
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:15,213
Watch a movie at the drive-in theater and eat something delicious.

439
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:17,019
Oh I totally like it, the drive-in theater.

440
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:18,692
I've never been there before.

441
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,227
Excuse me.

442
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:26,193
Then how about we go to a nice park and ride bikes?

443
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:27,627
Oh I like that!

444
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:32,724
Oh let's do that first, then let's go to the amusement park, and the drive-in theater.

445
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:36,107
Enjoy.

446
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,993
Have you gone to the Namsan Tower?

447
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:56,873
There's a place there, where you can write your names on a lock and if you do your love will stay true!

448
00:34:56,873 --> 00:35:03,927
Watch your head.

449
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:28,502
Here, sit.

450
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:34,076
Oh, let's take another one.

451
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:51,063
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

452
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:53,056
If he's this nice to me...

453
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:58,893
I don't know what to do.

454
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:01,086
Right, this is what a date is.

455
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:06,086
A typical girl would have experienced lots of them by the time she's 19.

456
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:10,527
Ha Ni!

457
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,627
Did you have a nice time?

458
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,016
Yes.

459
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:17,127
Here.

460
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:22,064
It's been a long time since I had this much fun.

461
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,066
Why is that?

462
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:28,026
Is it because when you're with Baek Seung Jo,you're nervous?

463
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:30,036
Well.

464
00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:33,193
How many years have it been that you liked Baek Seung Jo?

465
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:36,027
What?

466
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:40,086
More or less 4 years.

467
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:43,393
Since High school.

468
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:45,593
I guess this will be a prolonged war for me, then.

469
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:46,036
What?

470
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,086
No...

471
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:49,927
If you loved him for 4 years...

472
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,993
Just because I've suddenly appeared before you,

473
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:57,527
doesn't mean your heart is suddenly going to change.

474
00:36:57,527 --> 00:37:01,026
Even if you only think of me from time to time,

475
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:05,026
I'm satisfied with that.

476
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:09,046
He's 180 degrees different from Seung Jo.

477
00:37:09,046 --> 00:37:14,827
I expected it, but Seung Jo eventually didn't show up.

478
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:35,096
Ha Ni, let's go!

479
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:43,086
I can't let it continue like this. This just allowed me to reconfirm that Seung Jo really has no feelings for me.

480
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:48,593
And if I continue along with this, I'm only using Gi Tae sunbae.

481
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:51,293
So, my heart aches.

482
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:54,093
I must end it.

483
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:56,593
What are you doing?

484
00:37:56,593 --> 00:37:57,993
Ah, Sunbae.

485
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:00,693
What are you thinking about in a place like this?

486
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,293
Were you looking at something?

487
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:05,293
No.

488
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:09,096
You were looking at Seung Jo from here?

489
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:12,127
Sunbae, I . . .

490
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:13,793
Oh Ha Ni!

491
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:17,027
Forget Seung Jo already.

492
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:23,593
Sunbae, I have something to sa-

493
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:27,527
Come here.

494
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:28,693
Ha Ni.

495
00:38:28,693 --> 00:38:32,493
S-sunbae.

496
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:41,593
- No...- What is this?

497
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:43,893
Sunbae!

498
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:45,066
I think I've seen you before.

499
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:47,046
What are you trying to do to Ha Ni?

500
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:50,427
Joon Gu don't!

501
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:53,393
I was wondering what fool kept hanging around my Ha Ni.

502
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:58,627
You little fearless...

503
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,593
If you compare the time hanging around, then you've done it much longer.

504
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:05,036
What are you saying? What do you know?

505
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:08,036
Yes, Bong Joon Gu.

506
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:12,093
Why don't you give up already?

507
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:17,393
What?!

508
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:19,527
Stop it already!

509
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,193
What's going on?

510
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:25,026
What do you think you're doing in the library?

511
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:29,127
You two aren't fighting over Oh Ha Ni, right?

512
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:32,527
Hey Baek Seung Jo, this has nothing to do with you. So, back off.

513
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:36,627
Despite you guys fighting or shedding blood...

514
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:40,927
It doesn't really matter, but still.

515
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,427
The only person Ha Ni likes is me.

516
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:46,066
So isn't it a waste to fight over it?

517
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,593
Seung Jo.

518
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:53,593
My mother said for us all to eat dinner together.

519
00:39:53,593 --> 00:40:08,127
Let's go.

520
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:13,066
Slow down.

521
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:15,827
Baek Seung Jo, you have quite a lot of confidence.

522
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:16,066
What?

523
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:20,593
The only person Ha Ni likes is me?

524
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:23,016
My heart could have changed.

525
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:24,593
You haven't thought about that?

526
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:27,927
Never.

527
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:32,593
But, you were a little jealous, right?

528
00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:34,527
If you're going to put on a show...

529
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:37,493
Why don't you use your brains a bit more.

530
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:46,127
I can see right through everything you and mother are doing. Dummies.

531
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,627
He already knew everything...

532
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:53,026
He really can't be tricked.

533
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:55,992
See how nice it is for us to all gather like this?

534
00:40:55,992 --> 00:41:00,992
You like it too, right Seung Jo? Living alone I know exactly what you eat.

535
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,893
No matter where you go, eating at home is the best.

536
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:08,093
That's right. No matter which restaurant I go to, nothing compares to a home cooked meal.

537
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,076
I thought you said Dduk Bok Gi was the best thing in the world?!

538
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:14,593
Stupid.

539
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:19,016
But hey Su Chang, you aren't eating much today.

540
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:25,193
A new game is coming out so he's been pulling a lot of all nighters, so he's really tired.

541
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:27,027
Ahjusshi, I'll get some more soup for you.

542
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:31,227
No, his doctor told him not to eat too much.

543
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:35,027
No matter how enjoyable your work is, make sure you take of your health first.

544
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:36,393
Good health is the best thing!

545
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:40,227
Of course. Gi Dong shi, you take care of your health too.

546
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:51,453
Of course! Healthy is as healthy can be!

547
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:55,002
They ate up 3 bowls of Bool Nak porridge!

548
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:55,987
There's no way.

549
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:58,787
Seriously!

550
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:00,092
I'll just be leaving then.

551
00:42:00,092 --> 00:42:02,987
I thought you would sleep here tonight and then go...

552
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:08,072
Seung Jo, I have something to tell you. See me for a bit.

553
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:13,353
Yes.

554
00:42:13,353 --> 00:42:16,062
You are now an adult, too.

555
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:19,092
What do you think about your future plans?

556
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:26,653
It's been some time since you left the house. I feel like it's about time you start clearing up your thoughts.

557
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,987
No, not yet.

558
00:42:29,987 --> 00:42:32,253
Seung Jo.

559
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:37,453
I wish you would manage my gaming company.

560
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:46,453
First, as my right hand man. Next, as a successor of the company.

561
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:48,002
What do you think?

562
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:53,487
It's not that you're asking me what I think, but that I should do as you say, isn't it?

563
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:58,787
So you're just deciding my future as you wish.

564
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,002
No, that's not it.

565
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:07,753
If you're done talking, I'll get up first.

566
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:28,153
Okay, go.

567
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:29,042
I'm going.

568
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:31,087
Okay.

569
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:42,052
Go safely.

570
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,453
Just as the holidays were approaching...

571
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:48,087
Seung Jo suddenly disappeared.

572
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:54,653
He didn't show up at the tennis courts and even stopped part-timing at the family restaurant.

573
00:43:54,653 --> 00:43:57,022
Where could Seung Jo have gone?

574
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:59,022
Okay, I'm taking it.

575
00:43:59,022 --> 00:44:11,053
One, two, three... Say cheese!

576
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:15,052
The trails around here are really nice. We'll be preparing the bbq while you're gone.

577
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,032
Thank you.

578
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,042
Good-bye.

579
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,787
Hyung!

580
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:27,653
I've come.

581
00:44:27,653 --> 00:44:33,253
Sticky gum Ha Ni has found Seung Jo's new part time job!

582
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,053
Eun Jo, you came by yourself?

583
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:35,082
What about mom and dad?

584
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:40,753
Dad couldn't come because of workand mom said she couldn't leave dad alone.

585
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:43,487
Mother was really very disappointed.

586
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:46,387
It's obvious.

587
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:51,187
The water is really good! The water is really famous, seriously!

588
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:53,787
Aigoo, Ha Ni! Ha Ni has come!

589
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:57,753
Well then, if you need anything else, just call me.Rest for now.

590
00:44:57,753 --> 00:45:00,887
Yes.

591
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:03,853
Why did you come so late?Ah, this must be Eun Jo.

592
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:06,053
Just as I thought, it was you Sunbae.

593
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,032
Why don't you just open up your own broadcasting company.

594
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:10,853
What are you talking about?

595
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:17,092
You didn't tell other people too, did you?

596
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:21,687
Seung Jo!

597
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:27,087
Have you been well? Oh Eun Jo is here too!

598
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:29,153
Oh Seung Jo, have you been doing well?

599
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:33,553
Our villa is right over there. I want to invite you over for dinner. Want to come?

600
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:34,987
You're coming, right?

601
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:37,653
Eun Jo, hello.

602
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:42,553
Kyung Soo sunbae! Just to me?! What kind of secret information is this?!

603
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:50,072
I have something to tell you, come this way.

604
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,853
Ha Ni, Ha Ni.

605
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:58,553
I'm thinking about closing the deal with Hae Ra this time.

606
00:45:58,553 --> 00:46:00,753
Do you think, you can do that?

607
00:46:00,753 --> 00:46:03,986
So, I really need your help.

608
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:09,082
You and I have to join forces to stay afloat.

609
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:17,887
First off, I need you to keep staying near Seung Jo and stop him from approaching Hae Ra.

610
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:20,853
Sunbae it's Hae Ra that is approaching Seung Jo!

611
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:22,062
Has Seung Jo ever approached Hae Ra?

612
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:25,012
Just becoming a couple is important.

613
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:28,002
I'm going to ask to play a couple game. And then you can just become a couple.

614
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:32,153
- You and Seung Jo. Me and Hae Ra.- Ay...

615
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:35,042
Is it that easy? I've tried it this whole time and it's still yet to happen.

616
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,187
Don't worry.

617
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:39,553
I've planned and prepared everything.

618
00:46:39,553 --> 00:46:41,072
Give me your hand.

619
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:45,052
Let's try our best in order to achieve our loves!

620
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,022
I feel uneasy for some reason.

621
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:53,052
What are you doing? I said, let's do fighting!

622
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:54,092
Fighting.

623
00:46:54,092 --> 00:47:01,087
Hello all my youthful visitors. You've all come here in order to create memories of your youth.

624
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:03,092
Will checking out the scenery here and there create memories?! No it won't.

625
00:47:03,092 --> 00:47:16,052
So the couple games start now!

626
00:47:16,052 --> 00:47:18,087
Fool.

627
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:24,052
The way to play this game... Take a look at the map and see the numbers 1-7?

628
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:31,453
Those are all places. The couple that gets a stamp from all those spots first, wins the game.

629
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:36,087
This is the stamp!

630
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:39,087
It's not just a treasure hunt...

631
00:47:39,087 --> 00:47:44,587
But a stamp hunt!

632
00:47:44,587 --> 00:47:46,987
Then we have to decide on your partner.

633
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:52,032
Your partner will be decided fairly...

634
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:54,052
We'll use this ladder game method.

635
00:47:54,052 --> 00:47:58,253
Why isn't Seung Jo here?

636
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,012
And really it couldn't be helped...

637
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:07,887
But I will be joining this game in order to keep all of you safe. It really couldn't be helped.

638
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:12,653
What the?Eun Jo, haven't you seen Seung Jo?

639
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:13,787
I don't know.

640
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:16,753
Where the heck did he go?

641
00:48:16,753 --> 00:48:21,787
Here you go, this is it.

642
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:26,153
Hae Ra, what number?

643
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,953
Ah! Number 3!

644
00:48:27,953 --> 00:48:33,187
Then I'll be 8. Everyone pick.

645
00:48:33,187 --> 00:48:49,002
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.Viki

646
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:58,187
I'm dying here.

647
00:48:58,187 --> 00:49:02,387
It's like some villas or something.

648
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:06,053
Let's see.

649
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:08,987
Is this here?

650
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,553
I can't tell.

651
00:49:10,553 --> 00:49:13,887
I'm sure it'll show up eventually.

652
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:18,987
Ha Ni, just wait! I'll definitely protect you!

653
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:21,787
From now on, I'll never send you off alone!

654
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:28,253
Let's go.

655
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:34,087
Why must I do this with Oh Ha Ni?!

656
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:37,253
Oh! It's there, it's there!

657
00:49:37,253 --> 00:49:43,253
Come quickly!

658
00:49:43,253 --> 00:49:46,032
Wow it seems we're the first ones! Right, right, right?!

659
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:49,487
Shut up.

660
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:53,087
Ya, let's do this on good terms.

661
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:58,987
Why are you being like this too? Either way I can't even be with Seung Jo after coming this far.

662
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:09,062
Even elementary kids don't play games like this!

663
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:10,753
Do your legs hurt?

664
00:50:10,753 --> 00:50:13,787
I'll piggy back you.

665
00:50:13,787 --> 00:50:27,487
Try getting on my back.

666
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:28,952
Oh really!

667
00:50:28,952 --> 00:50:31,787
Did you set this up?

668
00:50:31,787 --> 00:50:44,753
You picked 3 first. How could I cheat that?

669
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:50,092
It's a bug.

670
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:53,387
I want to quit!

671
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:54,053
It's not fun.

672
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:56,887
Who said we're doing this for fun?

673
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:08,052
The great Yoon Hae Ra can't lose to Oh Ha Ni, right? Seung Jo wouldn't like that either.

674
00:51:08,052 --> 00:51:13,453
We just need 6 more.

675
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:17,453
Let's hurry up and find it then.

676
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:21,042
Where can it be?

677
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:25,187
You're the one that hid the stamps, Sunbae. So how could you not know, Sunbae?!

678
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:30,753
Since the trees all look the same, it's a little confusing.

679
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,787
What is it?

680
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:39,787
Since we just got the 4th stamp we just need to go...

681
00:51:39,787 --> 00:51:43,487
Did you hear that?

682
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,053
Just now, that sound...

683
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,387
Wasn't that the sound of a wolf?

684
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:56,053
Idiot. Wolves went extinct in our country.

685
00:51:56,053 --> 00:52:08,082
Then...a bear!?

686
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:13,177
I think I heard Ha Ni's voice.

687
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,042
Thank god! It's probably not following us, right?

688
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:18,309
It is not a relief!

689
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,082
Where are we?

690
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:34,653
It's alright Eun Jo. Noona will try to figure out our path. Don't worry.

691
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:39,002
Are you alright?

692
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:42,053
Yes, I am alright Eun Joo.

693
00:52:42,053 --> 00:52:45,053
Stupid!

694
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:48,002
But...my hat disappeared.

695
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:50,387
It's my most cherished.

696
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:53,053
Stay there.I'll come down there.

697
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:56,553
Yes.

698
00:52:56,553 --> 00:53:13,653
Eun Joo, be careful!

699
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:15,587
Where are we supposed to go?

700
00:53:15,587 --> 00:53:19,082
How did this change? Last night there wasn't any water.

701
00:53:19,082 --> 00:53:24,553
Strange.

702
00:53:24,553 --> 00:53:28,353
Hey, Hae Ra, let's go together.

703
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:30,187
Oh, hey, Hae Ra!

704
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:36,987
Let's go together! Together!

705
00:53:36,987 --> 00:53:39,092
I found it!

706
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:41,053
The stamp, the stamp!

707
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:42,012
Where?

708
00:53:42,012 --> 00:53:43,052
Oh, that?!

709
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:45,032
The stamp!

710
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:59,753
Let's go, hurry!

711
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:06,153
Gosh!

712
00:54:06,153 --> 00:54:09,453
This is why there's no reason to like you.

713
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:13,587
It's alright, I'm going.

714
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:17,287
Hey Hae Ra...

715
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:29,287
Seeing a guy like this, doesn't your motherly instincts...

716
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:34,062
Isn't that Ha Ni's hat?

717
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:39,653
Did something happen to you, Ha NI?

718
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:42,053
Just wait there awhile. I'll come and rescue you.

719
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:45,353
Oh that!

720
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:50,052
Alright this.

721
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:58,853
Aigoo!

722
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:01,087
Aigoo!

723
00:55:01,087 --> 00:55:02,553
Got it. Got it.

724
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:19,072
Alright, alright!

725
00:55:19,072 --> 00:55:22,753
Oh, Seung Jo!

726
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:26,853
Oh, really!

727
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:28,187
Seung Jo.

728
00:55:28,187 --> 00:55:32,002
Seung Joo, give me water..

729
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:33,587
What happened to Sunbae?

730
00:55:33,587 --> 00:55:37,163
I don't know! His body build is completely useless!

731
00:55:37,163 --> 00:55:39,072
Seung Jo, the mountains here are pretty rough.

732
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:41,653
There are animals making noises in the mountains.

733
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:44,062
Anyways, it was really hard.

734
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:46,062
Where are Eun Joo and Ha Ni?

735
00:55:46,062 --> 00:55:48,787
They were the first ones to leave.

736
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:50,853
They're still not back?

737
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:55,012
Give me water, water...

738
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:56,953
It got cold.

739
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,743
I am hungry too.

740
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:03,092
But other than that, the problem is not finding our way back.

741
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:06,384
There's still no signal.

742
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:10,953
Cell phones must not even work here.

743
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:13,753
Here.

744
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:15,193
Baek Eun Joo!

745
00:56:15,193 --> 00:56:18,012
You are amazing.

746
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:19,598
That's it!

747
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:22,487
Preparation. If you are prepared you'll be happy.

748
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:26,143
Analogy...

749
00:56:26,143 --> 00:56:28,153
What is it?

750
00:56:28,153 --> 00:56:39,208
Just put this over yourself.

751
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:43,453
Our Eun Jo sure is reliable.

752
00:56:43,453 --> 00:56:45,887
It feels like being with mini Seung Jo.

753
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:47,987
First we need to find the canyon.

754
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,487
If we follow the path we came from,

755
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:53,153
then we're going to be able to find a way out.

756
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:57,002
If we wait, won't Seung Jo come?

757
00:56:57,002 --> 00:56:58,082
You are really stupid!

758
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:03,253
How will he know that we are here?

759
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:08,022
Are you cold?

760
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:11,987
You can hold it.

761
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:15,253
You're so reliable.

762
00:57:15,253 --> 00:57:20,387
The sun is going to go down, and my feet are killing me. Damn it!

763
00:57:20,387 --> 00:57:23,753
Anyway, I need to go.

764
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:44,084
Aigoo!

765
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:47,873
Ha Ni, I am really sorry.

766
00:57:47,873 --> 00:57:54,807
I can't go up in this condition.

767
00:57:54,807 --> 00:57:57,692
Like this..

768
00:57:57,692 --> 00:58:01,907
Like this, definitely

769
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:20,873
This can't be!

770
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:25,295
Aigoo!

771
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:26,117
No!

772
00:58:26,117 --> 00:58:33,024
No!

773
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:37,024
No! That can't happen!

774
00:58:37,024 --> 00:58:39,018
Ha Ni!

775
00:58:39,018 --> 00:58:42,473
I love you!

776
00:58:42,473 --> 00:58:44,273
That sound, there it is again!

777
00:58:44,273 --> 00:58:45,798
What do we do!

778
00:58:45,798 --> 00:59:03,142
It's probably a village dog or something!

779
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:08,264
Isn't that Ha Ni's voice?

780
00:59:08,264 --> 00:59:11,034
Ha Ni!

781
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:13,084
Ha Ni!

782
00:59:13,084 --> 00:59:15,682
It must be coming this way.

783
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,624
What should we do?

784
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:29,094
Get behind me.

785
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:30,907
Hyung!

786
00:59:30,907 --> 00:59:31,545
Eun Jo!

787
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:34,007
Hyung!

788
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:47,187
Seung Jo!

789
00:59:47,187 --> 00:59:49,687
Won't anyone help me?

790
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:55,153
I would be grateful if someone came to help me.

791
00:59:55,153 --> 00:59:56,487
Oh.

792
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:57,753
Hey.

793
00:59:57,753 --> 01:00:00,153
Grab this.

794
01:00:00,153 --> 01:00:05,355
Isn't that voice Baek Seung Joo?

795
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:09,022
Hurry and grab this.

796
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,887
Hey.

797
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:13,187
Why are you butting in?!

798
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:15,253
Who the hell are you to save me!

799
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:16,253
Screw off!

800
01:00:16,253 --> 01:00:20,418
Really? Then, I'm leaving first.

801
01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:24,687
Hey, hey! Where are you going now?

802
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,787
Fine, we have to save Ha Ni.

803
01:00:27,787 --> 01:00:31,352
Calm down, she's safe. She went to the camp first.

804
01:00:31,352 --> 01:00:36,053
Rea...Really?

805
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:39,253
It is a relief, you really did well.

806
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:42,419
It is really a relief!

807
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:46,319
Hey! Then...

808
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,062
would you help me?

809
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:58,287
Man I'm dying.

810
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:03,753
Shut your mouth. I can't show anyone this side of me.

811
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:07,002
Especially not to Ha Ni. Got it?

812
01:01:07,002 --> 01:01:10,987
Anyways, nobody knows that you're here.

813
01:01:10,987 --> 01:01:14,453
Don't worry.

814
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:17,016
Man, I'm a complete mess.

815
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:20,092
How can I show this side of me to Baek Seung Jo.

816
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:22,626
Baek Seung Jo!

817
01:01:22,626 --> 01:01:27,587
I'm going to return the favor.

818
01:01:27,587 --> 01:02:54,053
That's not very appreciative.

819
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:55,092
Oh...Seung Jo!

820
01:02:55,092 --> 01:02:58,553
Did you come out for a walk?

821
01:02:58,553 --> 01:03:08,092
Yes.

822
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:11,487
You should've come alone.

823
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,042
Huh?

824
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:16,862
Saying that you like me and stuff..

825
01:03:16,862 --> 01:03:19,659
don't you know how I feel?

826
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:22,841
How you feel...

827
01:03:22,841 --> 01:04:01,829
There's no way someone like me...

828
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:05,162
It was a dream.

829
01:04:05,162 --> 01:04:09,567
I was surprised.

830
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:11,629
No wonder

831
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:13,762
It was playing out so smoothly.

832
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:17,095
If I knew it was a dream...

833
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:24,295
I should have dreamed a bit longer before waking up.

834
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:27,729
But...

835
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:54,011
the feeling of his lips

836
01:04:54,011 --> 01:05:12,729

837
01:05:12,729 --> 01:05:15,392
For the first time I want to do something.

838
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:17,032
I'm going to apply for medical school.

839
01:05:17,032 --> 01:05:20,129
I have a dream too.

840
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:22,283
Tell me that dream.

841
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:25,762
That you want to do something with me?

842
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:26,962
I'll make it come true.

843
01:05:26,962 --> 01:05:28,429
Did you grab your wallet?

844
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:33,862
A new wife, I'm sure you want to call him honey.

845
01:05:33,862 --> 01:05:36,078
Let me choose what I want to do with my life.

846
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:38,562
Baek Seung Jo

847
01:05:38,562 --> 01:05:40,516
I've decided to become a doctor.

848
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:43,762
I will not inherit father's company.

849
01:05:43,762 --> 01:05:45,095
Father!

850
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:46,229
Father, what's wrong!

851
01:05:46,229 --> 01:05:46,995
Honey!

852
01:05:46,995 --> 01:05:47,762
Are you okay?

853
01:05:47,762 --> 01:05:51,362
This is the first time you want to do something right?

854
01:05:51,362 --> 99:59:59,999
If I do this, Dad will be happy. I have no interest in it but at least he'll be happy.

1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,382
I'm going to do a couple of lattice multiplication examples in this video,

2
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:06,687
and in the next one we'll try to understand why it worked.

3
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:14,705
Let's say we're trying to multiply twenty-seven times forty-eight.

4
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:18,772
What you do is you write down your twenty-seven.

5
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:20,481
The two and the seven are going to get separate columns

6
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:24,101
and you write your forty-eight down the right-hand side,

7
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,345
and then you draw a lattice.

8
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:28,340
This is why it's called lattice multiplication.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,064
So the two is going to get its own column.

10
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,996
The seven is going to get its own column.

11
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,881
The four is going to get its own row,

12
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,807
and the eight is going to get its own row.

13
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,845
Now the fun thing about lattice multiplication

14
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,712
is you get to do all of your multiplication at one time,

15
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:44,930
and then you can finish up the problem with all your addition.

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,921
You don't have to keep switching gears by carrying and all of that.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,805
Although there is carrying,

18
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,260
but it's all while you're doing the addition step.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,510
So we're almost done with our lattice.

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,800
We actually have to draw these diagonals here.

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,322
We'll understand in the next video why these diagonals even work.

22
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:58,550
Just like that.

23
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,310
And now we're ready to multiply.

24
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,440
Seven times four is twenty-eight.

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,230
Seven times four is equal to twenty-eight.

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,310
So you write down a two and an eight just like that.

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,580
Two times four is equal to eight.

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,380
So you write down a zero, eight, just like that.

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,690
Then you have seven times eight.

30
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,154
Seven times eight is equal to fifty-six.

31
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:27,240
So we write down a five and a six.

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,490
And then finally, two times eight is equal to sixteen.

33
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,800
You write down a one and a six, just like that.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,750
And we're done with all of our multiplying.

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,532
Now we're ready to add.

36
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:43,448
So what you do is you go down these diagonals that I drew here.

37
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:48,161
So this first diagonal, which is really the ones diagonal, you just have a six sitting here.

38
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:50,500
So you write a six just like that.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,140
Then we move over to the next diagonal.

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,600
This diagonal with the six, five, and eight in it.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,360
That's our tens diagonal.

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,960
So eight plus five is thirteen.

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,600
Thirteen plus six is nineteen.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,695
So you write your nine right here in the tens place,

45
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:11,408
and now you carry the one in nineteen up there into the hundreds place,

46
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,900
because this isn't just nineteen, it's actually one hundred ninety.

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,850
It's nineteen tens.

48
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,580
Anyway, you carry your one.

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,510
You have one plus two is three.

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,780
Three plus eight is eleven.

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,620
Eleven plus one is twelve.

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,868
You write the two in your hundreds place

53
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:32,020
and you carry the one into your thousands place.

54
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,806
One plus zero is one,

55
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:37,210
so you just have a one in your thousands place, just like that.

56
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,440
And you get our answer.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:48,557
Twenty-seven times forty-eight is equal to one thousand two hundred ninety-six.

58
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:49,725
Let's do a harder problem.

59
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:56,156
One that requires more digits, just to show that this will work for any problem.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,868
Let's say we had five thousand four hundred seventy-nine times--

61
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,197
let's do a three-digit number--

62
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:09,650
Times seven hundred eighty-seven.

63
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,548
So just like we did in the last time, we make four columns.

64
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:15,603
One for the five, the four, the seven, and the nine.

65
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:22,140
We'll have five thousand four hundred seventy-nine

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,132
and then times seven hundred eighty-seven.

67
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,555
So they each get their own row.

68
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:30,780
Seven hundred eighty-seven.

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,560
Looks like that.

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,060
Then we have to draw our lattice.

71
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,790
Draw the lattice.

72
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,050
Each of these guys get their own column.

73
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,830
Draw the columns just like that.

74
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,714
And then each one of these characters get their own row.

75
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:50,931
One row for the seven.

76
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,757
One row for the eight.

77
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:56,255
One row for this other seven.

78
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,900
Then we have to draw the diagonals.

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,470
Draw it like that.

80
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,828
One diagonal, two diagonals,

81
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:08,015
three diagonals, four diagonals.

82
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,024
I think you get the idea.

83
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,740
And then we have just one, two more diagonals.

84
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,110
We're ready to multiply now.

85
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,790
So it's nine times seven.

86
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,970
I won't do it on the side here.

87
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,240
We know our times tables.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,860
Nine times seven is sixty-three.

89
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,640
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,560
Four times seven is twenty-eight.

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,470
Five times seven is thirty-five.

92
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,600
Let me switch colors arbitrarily.

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,350
Nine times eight is seventy-two.

94
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,210
Seven times eight is fifty-six.

95
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,970
Four times eight is thirty-two.

96
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,850
Five times eight is forty.

97
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,850
I'll switch colors again.

98
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,750
Nine times seven-- we saw that before.

99
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,050
It's sixty-three.

100
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,950
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

101
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,290
Four times seven is twenty-eight.

102
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,320
And then five times seven is thirty-five.

103
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,940
We're done with all of our multiplying.

104
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,210
Now we can switch our brains into addition mode.

105
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,860
Let me find a nice suitable color for addition.

106
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,270
Maybe a pink will do for addition.

107
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,520
So we start at our ones place.

108
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,005
Just have a three there, so you write the three in your ones place.

109
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:24,730
You go to the tens place.

110
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,830
Two plus six is eight.

111
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,620
Eight plus nine is seventeen.

112
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,072
Write the seven in the tens place, carry the one into the hundreds place.

113
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,692
I wrote a one really small here.

114
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,240
One plus three is four.

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,930
Four plus seven is eleven.

116
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,060
Eleven plus six is seventeen.

117
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,590
Seventeen plus four is twenty-one.

118
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,480
Twenty-one plus eight is twenty-nine.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,780
Write the nine in the hundreds place and carry the two.

120
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,690
Two plus six is eight.

121
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,688
Eight plus nine is seventeen.

122
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:02,290
Seventeen plus five is twenty-two.

123
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,700
Twenty-two plus two is twenty-four.

124
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,060
Twenty-four plus two is twenty-six.

125
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,101
Twenty-six plus five is thirty-one.

126
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,908
Carry the three.

127
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,460
Three plus four is seven.

128
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,160
Seven plus eight is fifteen.

129
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,930
Fifteen plus three is eighteen.

130
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,730
Eighteen plus zero is eighteen.

131
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,950
Eighteen plus three is twenty-one.

132
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,110
Write the one, carry the two.

133
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,520
Two plus two is four.

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,110
Four plus five is nine.

135
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,270
Nine plus four is thirteen.

136
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,872
Write the three, carry the one.

137
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,450
One plus three is four.

138
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,430
And we're done!

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,570
It's that easy.

140
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,370
Well, there's two advantages here.

141
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,350
One is, we got to do all of our multiplication at once.

142
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,090
And then we got to do all of our addition at once.

143
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,370
The other advantage is it's kind of neat and clean.

144
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,175
When you just do it the traditional way with carrying and number places,

145
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,610
it takes up a lot of space.

146
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,081
But notice, we did our whole problem in a nice, neat and clean area like that

147
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,130
and we got our answer.

148
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:09,900
Our answer is four million three hundred eleven thousand nine hundred seventy-three.

149
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,870
There you go.

150
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,768
Now in the next video, we are going to try to understand why this worked.

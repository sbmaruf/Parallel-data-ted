1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670


2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,490
We're asked to compute
3,060 divided by 36.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,860
We want to figure out how many
times does 36-- I don't need

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,045
to write it that big.

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:21,400
We need to figure out how many
times does 36 go into 3,060.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,910
Now, this is interesting because
we're dividing by a

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,080
two-digit number, by 36.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,450
We're going to see in this video
that the process is the

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,670
exact same way.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,870
There's just going to be a
little bit more mental

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,900
estimation going on, but we'll
do it explicitly here, so

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,230
hopefully, it won't
be too bad.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,490
So we first look at 36, and we
say, well, does 36 go into 3?

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,010
Well, no.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,550
3 is smaller than 36, so
it won't go into 3.

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,750
Does 36 go into 30?

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,350
No, 30 is still smaller than 36,
so it won't go into that.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,350
Does 36 go into 306?

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,030
Well, sure.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,130
306 is larger than 36, and if
we were to estimate it, 30

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,750
would go into 300 ten times, but
this is larger than 30, so

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,100
it's going to go fewer times.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,150
Maybe it's 9.

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,740
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,410
Let's try it out.

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,570
Let me try it out over
on the side.

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,390
What is 36 times 9?

28
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,610
And this is kind of the art of
doing these problems when

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,360
you're dividing a two-digit
number into something.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,280
So 6 times 9 is 54.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,320
Regroup, or carry the 5.

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,540
3 times 9 is 27, plus 5.

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,880
27 plus 5 is 32.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,710
So 36 times 9 is 324.

35
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,860
That's still larger than 306,
so we're going to have to go

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,310
36 less than that,
so we're going to

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,075
have to do eight times.

38
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,180
So we're going to have to
go into it eight times.

39
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,320
And remember, the way I thought
about that is I said

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,630
my first guess was maybe it goes
in nine times, but when I

41
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,640
tried out 36 times 9, that was
still larger than 306.

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,380
That got me 324.

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,860
Eight times should work, because
if you take 36 away,

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,040
if you only do 8 times
36, that's going to

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,110
take us below 300.

46
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,080
342, 136 away from that, or
another way, 324 minus 36 is

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
going to get us below 300.

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,200
So let's try this out
and just make sure.

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,310
8 times 6 is 48.

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,170
Put the 8 there; carry the 4.

51
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,600
8 times 3 is 24 plus 4 is 28.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,650
So 8 times 36 is 288
and it fits.

53
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,610
It's less than 306.

54
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,960
9 would've been too much.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,060
It would've been greater
than 306, so

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,310
now we can just subtract.

57
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,570


58
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,520
So we have 6 minus 8.

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,220
We can't just subtract
8 from 6.

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,890
We have to do a little
bit of regrouping.

61
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,760
Let's get a 10 from the ones
place right here, but we can't

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,205
borrow anything from here or
regroup anything from there,

63
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:59,670
so let's go to the
hundreds place.

64
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's take 1 from the hundreds
place, and so this will become

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,170
a 2, and then this 0 here
will become a 10.

66
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,370
Another way to think about it
is this is now 10 tens.

67
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,200
We took 100 from there,
and we're now

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,910
writing 100 as 10 tens.

69
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,940
Or another way to think about it
is you borrowed a 1, or you

70
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,430
took a 1, really.

71
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,040
You took a 1 from the
hundreds place.

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,290
That made it into a 2, and
then you put the 1 out in

73
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,510
front of the 0.

74
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,450
That's kind of the process
way of thinking about it.

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,380
Now, we have this 10 here,
and now we can

76
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,140
borrow from this 10.

77
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,780
So let's borrow from this 10.

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,290
So this 10 can become a 9.

79
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,310
1 is really taken from it, and
then this 6 becomes a 16.

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,600
Because if you think about it,
this 10 was really 10 tens.

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,310
It's in the tens place, so when
you put a 10 there, it

82
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,990
really means 10 tens.

83
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,730
So if you take 1 away from it,
this is actually now 90, and

84
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,600
we have 10 to give to this 6,
and 10 plus 6 is 16, so that's

85
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,090
what we're really doing.

86
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,340
But now we're ready to subtract,
so we have 16 minus

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,060
8 is 8, 9 minus 8 is 1,
and 2 minus 2 is 0.

88
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,149
So we have 18 left over, and now
we can bring down this 0

89
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,339
right here.

90
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,440
Bring down that 0.

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,880
So how many times does
36 go into 180?

92
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,020
And once again, this is going
to be estimation.

93
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,790
It's not going to
be six times.

94
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,240
6 times 30 would be 180.

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,800
6 times 36 would be too big,
because 36 is bigger than 30,

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,020
so let's try 5.

97
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,790
Let's see if 5 works.

98
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,770
So let's see.

99
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,750
5 times 6-- and there's
a little trial

100
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,760
and error here sometimes.

101
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,860
5 times 6 is 30.

102
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,310
Put the 0; carry the 3.

103
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,990
We don't need that.

104
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,330
That's from last time.

105
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,410
5 times 3 is 15 plus 3 is 18.

106
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,840
It looks like it works out.

107
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,020
You subtract 180 from
180, your get zero,

108
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,410
so we have no remainder.

109
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,470


110
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,000
So we're left with 36 goes in
3,060 eighty-five times.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So this is equal to 85.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,199

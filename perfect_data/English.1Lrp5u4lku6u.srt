1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,420
A line has a slope of negative
3/4 and goes through the point

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,950
0 comma 8.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,060
What is the equation of this
line in slope-intercept form?

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,570
So any line can be represented
in slope-intercept form, is

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,680
y is equal to mx plus b,
where this m right over here,

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,530
that is of the
slope of the line.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,870
And this b over here, this is
the y-intercept of the line.

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,500
Let me draw a quick
line here just so

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,790
that we can visualize
that a little bit.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,580
So that is my y-axis.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,826
And then that is my x-axis.

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:44,312

14
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:45,270
And let me draw a line.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,630
And since our line here
has a negative slope,

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,560
I'll draw a downward
sloping line.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,995
So let's say our line
looks something like that.

18
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:55,720

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,890
So hopefully, we're a little
familiar with the slope

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,390
already.

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,931
The slope essentially
tells us, look,

22
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:02,960
start at some point
on the line, and go

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,200
to some other point
of the line, measure

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,846
how much you had to move in the
x direction, that is your run,

25
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:10,220
and then measure
how much you had

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,440
to move in the y direction,
that is your rise.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,870
And our slope is equal
to rise over run.

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,190
And you can see over here,
we'd be downward sloping.

29
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,820
Because if you move in
the positive x direction,

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,510
we have to go down.

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,052
If our run is positive,
our rise here is negative.

32
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:29,885
So this would be a
negative over a positive,

33
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:31,400
it would give you
a negative number.

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,870
That makes sense, because
we're downward sloping.

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,100
The more we go down
in this situation,

36
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,950
for every step we
move to the right,

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,490
the more downward
sloping will be,

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,190
the more of a negative
slope we'll have.

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,230
So that's slope right over here.

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,220
The y-intercept just tells us
where we intercept the y-axis.

41
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,640
So the y-intercept, this
point right over here,

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,690
this is where the line
intersects with the y-axis.

43
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,830
This will be the
point 0 comma b.

44
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,310
And this actually just falls
straight out of this equation.

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,730
When x is equal to
0-- so let's evaluate

46
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,920
this equation, when
x is equal to 0.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,200
y will be equal to
m times 0 plus b.

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,770
Well, anything times 0 is 0.

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,560
So y is equal to 0
plus b, or y will

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,860
be equal to b, when
x is equal to 0.

51
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,370

52
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,660
So this is the point 0 comma b.

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,860
Now, they tell us what
the slope of this line is.

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,930
They tell us a line has
a slope of negative 3/4.

55
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,112
So we know that our
slope is negative 3/4,

56
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:43,320
and they tell us that the
line goes through the point

57
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,900
0 comma 8.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,100
They tell us we go through the--
Let me just, in a new color.

59
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,950
I've already used orange,
let me use this green color.

60
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,010
They tell us what we go
through the point 0 comma 8.

61
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,160
Notice, x is 0.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,750
So we're on the y-axis.

63
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,510
When x is 0, we're
on the y-axis.

64
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,720
So this is our y-intercept.

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,060
So b, we could say-- we could
do a couple-- our y-intercept is

66
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,630
the point 0 comma 8, or we
could say that b-- Remember,

67
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,240
it's also 0 comma b.

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,710
We could say b is equal to 8.

69
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,860
So we know m is equal to
negative 3/4, b is equal to 8,

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,580
so we can write the
equation of this line

71
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,200
in slope-intercept form.

72
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:39,540
It's y is equal to negative
3/4 times x plus b, plus 8.

73
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,780
And we are done.

74
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,093

1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're on problem 71.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they ask us, which fraction is equivalent to this

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thing, 3x over 5 divided by x plus 4 over x plus 2?

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now the best way to do this, let's simplify the denominator

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first. So that's equal to 3x over 5.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of that over --let's find a common denominator.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The common denominator is 4.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we have a common denominator of 4, x/4 is of

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
course x/4.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x/2 is the same thing as 2x over 4.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So plus 3x over 4.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2x over 4 is the same thing as x/2.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now if you divide by a certain fraction, that's the

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
same thing as multiplying by its inverse.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is going to be equal to 3x over 5 times the inverse

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of this, times 4 over x plus 2x.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see what we could do.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we could factor out an x here.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this becomes x times 1 plus 2.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually, 1 plus 2 is 3.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I should have said x plus 2x is equal to 3x.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I should have done.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's silly, I shouldn't have done that.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,320
Find the greatest common
factor of these monomials.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,970
Now, the greatest common
factor of anything

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,571
is the largest factor
that's divisible into both.

5
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,070
If we're talking about just
pure numbers, into both numbers,

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,390
or in this case,
into both monomials.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,070
Now, we have to be
a little bit careful

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,570
when we talk about
greatest in the context

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,897
of algebraic
expressions like this.

10
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,730
Because it's greatest
from the point of view

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,190
that it includes the most
factors of each of these

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,850
monomials.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,560
It's not necessarily the
greatest possible number

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,150
because maybe some
of these variables

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,820
could take on
negative values, maybe

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,490
they're taking on
values less than 1.

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,906
So if you square
it, it's actually

18
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,300
going to become
a smaller number.

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,970
But I think without getting
too much into the weeds there,

20
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,570
I think if we just kind of
run through the process of it,

21
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,450
you'll understand it
a little bit better.

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,107
So to find the
greatest common factor,

23
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:51,690
let's just essentially
break down each

24
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,900
of these numbers
into what we could

25
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,536
call their prime factorization.

26
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,910
But it's kind of a combination
of the prime factorization

27
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,650
of the numeric
parts of the number,

28
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,300
plus essentially
the factorization

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,720
of the variable parts.

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,260

31
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,130
If we were to
write 10cd squared,

32
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,850
we can rewrite
that as the product

33
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,910
of the prime factors of 10.

34
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,440
The prime factorization
of 10 is just 2 times 5.

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,470
Those are both prime numbers.

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,930
So 10 can be broken
down as 2 times 5.

37
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,740
c can only be broken down by c.

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,730
We don't know anything else
that c can be broken into.

39
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,650
So 2 times 5 times c.

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,800
But then the d squared can
be rewritten as d times d.

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,920
This is what I mean by writing
this monomial essentially

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,970
as the product of
its constituents.

43
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,470
For the numeric part of
it, it's the constituents

44
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,950
of the prime factors.

45
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,630
And for the rest
of it, we're just

46
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,770
kind of expanding
out the exponents.

47
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,560
Now, let's do that for 25c
to the third d squared.

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,250
So 25 right here,
that's 5 times 5.

49
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,350
So this is equal to 5 times 5.

50
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,470
And then c to the third,
that's times c times c times c.

51
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,840
And then d squared,
times d squared.

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,470
d squared is times d times d.

53
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,770
So what's their greatest
common factor in this context?

54
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,330
Well, they both
have at least one 5.

55
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,070

56
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,700
Then they both have at
least one c over here.

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,400
So let's just take up one
of the c's right over there.

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,030
And then they both have two d's.

59
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,210

60
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,510
So the greatest common factor
in this context, the greatest

61
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,890
common factor of
these two monomials

62
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,620
is going to be the factors
that they have in common.

63
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,190
So it's going to be equal to
this 5 times-- we only have one

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,240
c in common, times--
and we have two

65
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,020
d's in common, times d times d.

66
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,060
So this is equal to 5cd squared.

67
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,745
And so 5d squared, we can kind
of view it as the greatest.

68
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:59,060
But I'll put that
in quotes depending

69
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,920
on whether c is
negative or positive

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,360
and d is greater
than or less than 0.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,920
But this is the greatest common
factor of these two monomials.

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,950
It's divisible
into both of them,

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,410
and it uses the most
factors possible.

74
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,910

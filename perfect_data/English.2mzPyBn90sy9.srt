00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My doctors told me that my lung capacity

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
had gone down to 70 percent,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and it was killing me.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With the help of IIT,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
TERI, and learnings from NASA,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we discovered that there are three

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
basic green plants,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
common green plants, with which

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we can grow all the fresh air

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we need indoors to keep us healthy.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've also found that you can

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
reduce the fresh air requirements

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
into the building, while maintaining

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
industry indoor air-quality standards.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The three plants are Areca palm,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The botanical names are in front of you.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Areca palm is a plant which

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We need four shoulder-high plants per person,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and in terms of plant care,

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we need to wipe the leaves

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
every day in Delhi, and perhaps

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
once a week in cleaner-air cities.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We had to grow them in vermi manure,

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is sterile, or hydroponics,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and take them outdoors every three to four months.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which is again a very common plant,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and we call it a bedroom plant,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The third plant is money plant,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and this is again a very common plant;

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
preferably grows in hydroponics.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and other volatile chemicals.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
With these three plants,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you can grow all the fresh air you need.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In fact, you could be in a bottle

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
with a cap on top, and you would not die at all,

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and you would not need any fresh air.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We have tried these plants at our

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
own building in Delhi, which is a

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Our studies have found that there is

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
going up by one percent if one stays indoors

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in this building for 10 hours.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The government of India has discovered

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or published a study to show

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And the study showed that,

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
compared to other buildings,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
there is a reduced incidence of

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
eye irritation by 52 percent,

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
respiratory systems by 34 percent,

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
headaches by 24 percent,

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And this study has been published on September 8, 2008,

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and it's available on the government of India website.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Our experience points to an

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
amazing increase in human productivity

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
by over 20 percent by using these plants.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We are now replicating this in a

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
1.75-million-square-feet building,

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
which will have 60,000 indoor plants.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Why is this important?

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It is also important for the environment,

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
because the world's energy

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
requirements are expected to grow

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
by 30 percent in the next decade.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
40 percent of the world's energy is taken

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
up by buildings currently,

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and 60 percent of the world's population

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
will be living in buildings in cities

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And there is a growing preference for living

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and working in air-conditioned places.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
"Be the change you want to see in the world,"

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
said Mahatma Gandhi.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And thank you for listening.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
(Applause)

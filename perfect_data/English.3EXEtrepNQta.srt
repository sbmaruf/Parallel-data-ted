00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:14,411
Sixty-nine year-old Palestinian Leila Khaled, oncea medical student, became a resistance fighter

3
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:20,225
for the PFLP movement (the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine) and with others hijacked an

4
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:26,407
aeroplane in 1969. She was convicted and laterreleased in an exchange deal.

5
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:32,061
Forced to flee her home in Haifa in the 1948Catastrophe, she famously demanded the pilot

6
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:38,009
of hijacked flight TWA840 to fly over Haifaso she could see her hometown, inaccessible

7
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,983
to her after the creation of Israel.

8
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:46,799
Leila continues to be a symbol of Palestinianarmed resistance, while to Israel she is a

9
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,598
convicted and unrepentant terrorist.

10
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:54,065
She now lives with her husband and 2 sonsin Jordan; I met her during her recent visit

11
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:58,392
to Gaza in a PFLP office.

12
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:04,866
Looking at what happened recently in Gazawith Israel's Operation Pillar of Cloud, the

13
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:09,866
nature of the resistance force against thestate of Israel during this time, I think

14
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:14,783
surprised a lot of people, even maybe Gazans.And it seemed that there was an ability

15
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:24,042
to repel Israel to some extent. So my questionis in today's context, is resistance strategically

16
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,373
or symbolically useful?

17
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:34,633
It's always strategic. Because when there'soccupation, there is always resistance. And

18
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:45,236
this is a fundamental equation. History taughtus that freedom and liberation cannot be achieved

19
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:54,449
without facing reactionary violence (exceptby revolutionary resistance). And this is

20
00:01:54,449 --> 00:02:03,629
guaranteed by the international law. The eighthitem of the United Nations Charter says people

21
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:09,649
under oppression and occupation have the rightto resist, including armed struggle. So we

22
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:17,936
are defending ourselves and as you said, Israelwas the first one to be shocked by the resistance

23
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,567
itself.

24
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:33,916
Our people, our factions learnt from [the]last war in 2008, that they have to prepare

25
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:42,085
themselves for another attack because thewar did not end. This is a battle now and

26
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:46,718
we are proud of the resistance and our people.

27
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:57,316
The main thing [is] that resistance unitedthe people in spite of the division. While

28
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:06,383
Negotiations divided people. And this is oneof the main achievements. This means that

29
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:20,099
the leaderships of Hamas and Fatah shouldabide by the attitude of our people, whether

30
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:28,483
inside Gaza, in the West Bank, in all [of]Palestine, in [the] Diaspora. All our masses

31
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:39,548
were [in] the streets in different countrieswhere they are, even in foreign countries,

32
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:44,001
saying one thing: we are with the resistance.

33
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:48,073
[For] Israel this is not the first time tohave [an] excursion and attack against our

34
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:57,025
people, whether in the West Bank or in Gazaor in Sabra and Shatila and Lebanon and everywhere.

35
00:03:57,025 --> 00:04:06,497
Do you expect our people to go, throw roseson the planes which killed our children? No.

36
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,488
Resistance is something human.

37
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:18,316
What about the French revolution? This isfrom Europe. Now you're asking about the people

38
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:28,966
in Europe. But let them think of what theNazis did in Europe. Destroyed Europe. Fifty

39
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:40,591
million casualties. That was in Europe. Andthe people resisted [Nazism] and it was defeated.

40
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:41,799
Are we waiting for...?

41
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,976
Nazism, yes?

42
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:50,555
Yes. They defeated Nazism. Are we waitingfor the Zionists to launch a third World War?

43
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:58,716
I think it's important to think of that. Andthink that fascists and Nazis and the Zionists

44
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:05,984
cannot be defeated except by resistance, withall its means, including armed struggle.

45
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:12,012
What does the resistance (the Palestinianarmed resistance) have to do with Islam?

46
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,666
Is there any relation with Islam?

47
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:26,329
It called for resistance of injustice,whoever inflict[s] atrocities upon our people.

48
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:34,963
Looking at the successful UN bid, I personallysee this as a consolidation of the two-state

49
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:44,899
resolution to the injustice. So you famouslyasked the pilot to fly over Haifa to see your

50
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:51,959
homeland. So my question is to you, what ofthe one-state solution? Do you support it?

51
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,616
If so, why? And if so, how? How? How doesone get there?

52
00:05:56,616 --> 00:06:07,466
Well, we in [the] PFLP, in our programme.There is a transitional period to achieve

53
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:18,919
the strategic goal of our struggle. And theprogramme that all factions [that] were united

54
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,949
in [the] PLO — [the] right [of] return,right of self-determination, [the] building

55
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:34,125
our own state with Jerusalem [as] its capital.These are the goals of our struggle as a transitional

56
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:38,317
period to establish democratic Palestine.

57
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:50,566
And I think that this is realistic also. Butwe can never, and we don't, accept the solution

58
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:58,663
of the Americans, who are the supporters ofour occupants. That two-state solution means

59
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:07,883
that we give up seventy-eight percent of ourland. And how? The core issues of the whole

60
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:16,316
thing (of the Palestinian cause) lies in two:the land (to be sovereign over [it]) and the

61
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:24,883
return of the refugees. Any solution thatdoesn't deal with [these] two issues, I think

62
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:26,908
that it [wouldn't] last long.

63
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:35,905
[The] Oslo Accords proved that it's a failurefor both sides who signed and who accepted

64
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:45,583
this signature. But at the same time we believein our people, we believe in the will of our

65
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:52,633
people to practice their rights, the rightsthat were recognised also by the international

66
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,715
community in the United Nations.

67
00:07:55,715 --> 00:08:05,077
So thinking of [a] two-state solution meansthat we have twelve percent of the land. This

68
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:12,699
is not Palestine. Palestine is the historicalPalestine. I'm from Haifa. That one from Akka.

69
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:18,083
That one from Jaffa. Those people have theright to go back to their homelands. And it's

70
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,742
guaranteed also by international law.

71
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,033
Thank you very much, indeed.

72
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,139
Most welcome.

73
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:33,697
Thank you.

74
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,737
You're from Britain?

75
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,612
Yup. It's nice to meet you.

76
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:43,757
When you go there, ask them: if anybodyattacks their homes would they smile in front

77
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,425
of their occupants? I don't think so.

1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,380
Well, after the last video,
hopefully, we're a little

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,330
familiar with how you
add matrices.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,150
So now let's learn how
to multiply matrices.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,450
And keep in mind, these are
human-created definitions for

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,840
matrix multiplication.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,000
We could have come up with
completely different ways to

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,450
multiply it.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,510
But I encourage you to learn
this way because it'll help

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,810
you in math class.

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,100
And we will see later that
there's actually a lot of

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,730
applications that come out
of this type of matrix

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,290
multiplication.

13
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,340
So let me think of
two matrices.

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,320
I will do two 2 by 2 matrices,
and let's multiply them.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,500
Let's say-- let me pick some
random numbers: 2,

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,530
minus 3, 7, and 5.

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,980
And I'm going to multiply that
matrix, or that table of

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:56,440
numbers, times 10, minus 8--
let me pick a good number

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,980
here-- 12, and then minus 2.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,400
So now there might be a strong
temptation-- and you know in

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,330
some ways it's not even an
illegitimate temptation-- to

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,880
do the same thing with
multiplication that we did

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,520
with addition, to just multiply
the corresponding

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,580
terms. So you might be tempted
to say, well, the first term

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,160
right here, the 1, 1 term, or
in the first row and first

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,070
column, is going to
be 2 times 10.

27
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,970
And this term is going
to be minus 3 times

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,230
minus 8 and so forth.

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,330
And that's how we added matrices
so maybe it's a

30
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,510
natural extension to multiply
matrices the same way.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,180
And that is legitimate.

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,530
One could define it that way,
but that's not the way it is

33
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,410
in the real world.

34
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,380
And the way in the real world,

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,470
unfortunately, is more complex.

36
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,980
But if you look at a
bunch of examples I

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,670
think you'll get it.

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,460
And you'll learn that
it's actually fairly

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,980
straightforward.

40
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,985
So how do we do it?

41
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:53,290
So this first term that's in
the first row and its first

42
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,050
column, is equal to essentially
this first row's

43
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,380
vector-- no, this first
row vector--

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,790
times this column vector.

45
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,229
Now what do I mean
by that, right?

46
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,320
So it's getting it's row
information from the first

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,170
matrix's row, and it's getting
it's column information from

48
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,320
the second matrix's column.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,190
So how do I do that?

50
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,860
If you're familiar with dot
product, it's essentially the

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,930
dot product of these
two matrices.

52
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,820
Or without saying it that fancy,
it's just this: it's 2

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,890
times 10, so 2-- I'm going to
write small-- times 10, plus

54
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,640
minus 3 times 12.

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,630
I'm going to run out of space.

56
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,600
And so what's this second
term over here?

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,170
Well, we're still on the first
row of the product vector but

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,350
now we're on the
second column.

59
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,910
We get our column information
from here.

60
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,800
So let's pick a good color--
this is a slightly different

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,530
shade of purple.

62
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,110
So now this is going to be--
I'll do that in another

63
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,580
color-- 2 times minus 8-- let me
just write out the number--

64
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:18,810
2 times minus 8 is minus 16,
plus minus 3 times minus 2--

65
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,160
what's minus 3 times minus 2?

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,400
That is plus 6, right?

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,870
So that's in row 1 column 2.

68
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,590
It's minus 16 plus 6.

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,830
And then let's come down here.

70
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,920
So now we're in the
second row.

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,550
So now we're going to use--
we're getting our row

72
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,930
information from the first
matrix-- I know this is

73
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,380
confusing and I feel bad for you
right now, but we're going

74
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,230
to a bunch of examples and
I think it'll make sense.

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,060
So this term-- the bottom left
term-- is going to be this row

76
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,310
times this column.

77
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:58,010
So it's going to be 7 times
10, so 70, plus 7 times 10

78
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:05,650
plus 5 times 12, plus 60.

79
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,290
And then the bottom right term
is going to be 7 times minus

80
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:19,540
8, which is minus 56 plus
5 times minus 2.

81
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,900
So that's minus 10.

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:31,290
So the final product is going to
be 2 times 10 is 20, minus

83
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:41,040
36, so that's minus 16
plus 6, that's 10.

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,220
90-- was that what I said?

85
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,390
No, it was-- 70, plus
60, that's 130.

86
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:55,580
And then minus 56 minus
10, so minus 66.

87
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,400
So there you have it.

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,020
We just multiplied this matrix
times this matrix.

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,360
Let me do another example.

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,490
And I think I'll actually
squeeze it on this side so

91
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,106
that we can write this side out
a little bit more neatly.

92
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:18,630
So let's take the matrix and
now 1, 2, 3, 4, times the

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:27,710
matrix 5, 6, 7, 8.

94
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,200
Now we have much more space to
work with so this should come

95
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,760
out neater.

96
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,460
OK, but I'm going to do the
same thing, so to get this

97
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,350
term right here-- the top left
term-- we're going to take--

98
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,070
or the one that has row 1 column
1-- we're going to take

99
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:52,050
the row 1 information from
here, and the column 1

100
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,440
information from here.

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,070
So you can view it as
this row vector

102
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,120
times this column vector.

103
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,680
So it results, 1 times
5 plus 2 times 7.

104
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,380
Right?

105
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,610
There you go.

106
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,520
And so this term, it'll be this
row vector times this

107
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,740
column vector-- let me do that
in a different color-- will be

108
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,550
1 times 6 plus 2 times 8.

109
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,370
Let me write that down.

110
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,590
So it's 1 times 6
plus 2 times 8.

111
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,720
Now we go down to
the second row.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,130
And we get our row information
from the first vector-- let me

113
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:44,150
circle it with this color--
and it is 3 times 5

114
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,520
plus 4 times 7.

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
And then we are in the bottom
right, so we're in the bottom

116
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,070
row and second column.

117
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,350
So we get our row information
from here and our column

118
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,930
information from here.

119
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,860
So it's 3 times 6
plus 4 times 8.

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,680
And if we simplify,
this is 5 plus--

121
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,950
Well actually, let me just
remind you where all the

122
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,630
numbers came from.

123
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,200
So we have that green
color, right?

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,890
This 1 and this 2, that's
this 1 and this 2,

125
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,620
this 1 and this 2.

126
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:28,755
Right?

127
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,330
And notice, these were in the
first row and they're in the

128
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,660
first row here.

129
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,640
And this 5 and this 7?

130
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,920
Well, that's this 5 and this
7, and this 5 and this 7.

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,800
So, interesting.

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,410
This was in column 1 of the
second matrix and this is in

133
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,780
column 1 in the product
matrix.

134
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,030
And similarly, the
6 and the 8.

135
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,610
That's this 6, this 8, and then
it's used here, this 6

136
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,540
and this 8.

137
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,250
And then finally this 3 and the
4 in the brown, so that's

138
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,980
this 3, this 4, and
this 3 and this 4.

139
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,290
And we could of course
simplify all of it.

140
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,180
This was 1 times 5 plus 2 times
7, so that's 5 plus 14,

141
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,410
so this is 19.

142
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,200
This is 1 times 6 plus 2
times 8, so it's 6 plus

143
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,330
16, so that's 22.

144
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,380
This is 3 times 5
plus 4 times 7.

145
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,909
So 15 plus 28, 38, 43-- if my
math is correct-- and then we

146
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,250
have 3 times 6 plus 4 times 8.

147
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,220
So that's 18 plus
32, that's 50.

148
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,980
So now let me ask you-- just so
you know that the product

149
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,690
matrix-- just write
it neatly-- is

150
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,610
19, 22, 43, and 50.

151
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,100
So now let me ask
you a question.

152
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,810
When we did matrix addition we
learned that if I had two

153
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,210
matrices-- it didn't matter what
order we added them in.

154
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,970
So if we said, A plus B-- and
these are matrices; that's why

155
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,340
I'm making them all bold-- we
said this is the same thing as

156
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,330
B plus A, based on how
we define matrix

157
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,520
addition, B plus A.

158
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,060
So now let me ask
you a question.

159
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,970
Is multiplying two matrices,
is AB-- that's just means

160
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,460
we're multiplying A and B-- is
that the same thing as BA?

161
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,820
Does it matter?

162
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,800
Does the order of the matrix
multiplication matter?

163
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,310
And so, I'll tell you right
now, it actually matters a

164
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,090
tremendous amount.

165
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,550
And actually there are certain
matrices that you can add in

166
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,040
one direction that you can't
add in the other-- oh, that

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,300
you can multiply in one way but
you can't multiply in the

168
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,200
other order.

169
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,755
And well, I'll show you that
in an example-- but just to

170
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,800
show that this isn't even equal
for most matrices, I

171
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,640
encourage you to multiply these
two matrices in the

172
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,110
other order.

173
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,950
Actually let me do that.

174
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,630
Let me do that really
fast just to prove

175
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,440
the point to you.

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,830
So let me delete all
this top part.

177
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,830
Let me delete all of it, and
actually I can delete to this.

178
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,960
So hopefully, you know that when
I multiply this matrix

179
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,850
times this matrix, I got this.

180
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,250
So let me switch the order--
and I'll do it fairly fast

181
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,140
just so as to not bore you-- so
let me switch the order of

182
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,150
the matrix multiplication.

183
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,755
This is good as this is another
example-- so I'm going

184
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:36,740
to multiply this matrix: 5, 6,
7, 8, times this matrix-- and

185
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,400
I just switched the order; and
we're testing to see whether

186
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,700
order matters-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

187
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,010
Let's do it-- and I won't do all
the colors and everything,

188
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,690
I'll just do it systematically.

189
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,330
I think you just have to see a
lot of examples here-- So this

190
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,410
first term gets its row
information from the first

191
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,810
matrix, column information
from the second matrix.

192
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:06,340
So it's 5 times 1 plus 6 times
3, so it's 5 times 1--

193
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,130
Let me just write,
actually edit.

194
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:17,650
I'm going to skip a step here--
OK so it's 5 times 1

195
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:23,480
plus 6 times 3, plus 18.

196
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,110
What's the second term here?

197
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,650
It's going to be 5 times
2 plus 6 times 4.

198
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:40,190
So 5 times 2 is 10, plus
6 times 4 is 24.

199
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,390
Right, now we just took
this row times this

200
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,680
column right here.

201
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,030
OK now we're down here for the
set-- so then we're doing this

202
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,095
row, this element right here at
the bottom left is going to

203
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,960
use this row, and this column.

204
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:00,410
So it's 7 times 1
plus 8 times 3.

205
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,980
8 times 3 is 24.

206
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,430
And then finally, to get this
element we're essentially

207
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,820
multiplying this row times this
column, so it's 7 times 2

208
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:21,810
is 14, plus 8 times
4, plus 32.

209
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:30,020
So this is equal to 5
plus 18 is 23, 34.

210
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,100
What's 7 plus 24?

211
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,530
That's 31, 46.

212
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:44,140
So notice, if we called
this matrix A and this

213
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,080
is matrix B, right?

214
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:57,560
In the last example, we showed
that A times B is equal to 19,

215
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,640
22, 43, 50.

216
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,550
And we just showed that, well,
if you reverse the order, B

217
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,225
times A is actually this
completely different matrix.

218
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:12,230
So the order in which
you multiply

219
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,140
matrices completely matters.

220
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,330
So I'm actually running
out of time.

221
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,210
In the next video I going talk
a little bit more about the

222
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,260
types of matrix-- well, one, we
know that order matters--

223
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,110
and in the next video I'll
show that what type of

224
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,460
matrices can be multiplied
by each other.

225
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,820
When we added or subtracted
matrices, we just said, well

226
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,850
they have to have the same
dimensions because you're

227
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,855
adding or subtracting
corresponding terms. But

228
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,040
you'll see with multiplication
it's a little bit different.

229
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,253
And we'll do that in
the next video.

230
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,790
See you soon.

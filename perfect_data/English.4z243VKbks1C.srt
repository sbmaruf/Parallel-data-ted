00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:24,218
Everybody's really been looking forward to the new video from Lumpy and the Lumpettes

2
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:31,200
Even Lumpy!

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,390
Russell's a huge fan!

4
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,907
He can't wait to tell all his friends about it!

5
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:43,073
Hey, Russell! You didn't create that video! You just copied someone else's content.

6
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:48,502
Uploading someone else's content without permission could get you into a lot of trouble --

7
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:54,428
-- it may be copyright infringement.

8
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:57,260
Copyright is a form of protection for original works of authorship

9
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,398
including literary,

10
00:00:58,398 --> 00:00:59,313
dramatic,

11
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:00,488
musical,

12
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:01,463
graphic,

13
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:05,470
and audiovisual creations.

14
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,682
Copyright infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is reproduced, distributed, performed or publicly displayed

15
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:16,548
without the permission of the copyright holder or the legal right to do so.

16
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:22,238
Even though YouTube is a free site, you can get in serious trouble for copyright infringement

17
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:23,606
You can be sued --

18
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:27,261
-- and found liable for monetary damages.

19
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,013
You could lose your booty!

20
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:35,457
Or worse, you could lose your YouTube account!

21
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,779
You only get a few chances.

22
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:42,743
If YouTube receives a valid notification of alleged copyright infringement from a copyright holder

23
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:46,835
for one of your videos, the video will be removed in accordance with the law.

24
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:51,303
You'll be notified via email and in your account,

25
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:54,172
and you'll get a strike.

26
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,975
If YouTube finds you're a repeat offender --

27
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:02,714
-- you'll get banned for life!

28
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:15,906
Here's an idea: why not make your own video?

29
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:19,148
Uh oh! You're making a video of Lumpy's live performance of his song,

30
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,502
which is still protected by copyright.

31
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:29,944
You still may not be able to upload it without permission.

32
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:35,167
Oh, Russell. Your reuse of Lumpy's content is clever, but did you get permission for it?

33
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:40,005
Mashups or remixes of content may also require permission from the original copyright owner,

34
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,004
depending on whether or not the use is a "fair use."

35
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:48,182
In the United States, copyright law allows for the fair use of copyrighted material under certain limited circumstances without prior permission from the owner.

36
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:54,126
Under the law, determinations of fair use take into account the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the work

37
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:57,574
used in relation to the work as a whole, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work.

38
00:02:57,574 --> 00:03:00,837
Other jurisdictions may have similar copyright provisions protecting fair use or fair dealing.

39
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:06,990
If you are uncertain as to whether a specific use qualifies as a fair use, you should consult a qualified copyright attorney.

40
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:14,397
If someone copies your work after you've posted it, you have the right to take it down.

41
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:21,480
YouTube provides tools for rights holders to control the use of their content.

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,959
If someone takes down your video by mistake, or as the result of a misidentification of the material to be removed,

43
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,475
there's a counter-notification process for that.

44
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:35,017
You can send YouTube a notice that there was an error.

45
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:35,848
But be careful...

46
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:40,056
If you misuse the process, you could end up in court.

47
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:50,113
And then you would get in a lot of trouble! That's how the law works.

48
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:55,961
That's more like it! By singing an original song, you're creating your own content.

49
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:59,841
When you make an original video, you're the owner of your own copyright, and...

50
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:03,020
...you have the right to post it to YouTube.

51
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,152
Original content is what makes YouTube interesting. Start creating your own, and who knows?

52
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:11,504
Your video could explode!

53
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:16,542
[BOOM!]

54
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:21,046
If you're still unsure about copyright issues, YouTube has some resources as a starting point.

55
00:04:21,046 --> 99:59:59,999

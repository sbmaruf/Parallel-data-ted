1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:05,038
The Internet is one of the United States' most robust and growing industries.

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,922
It enables free and open communication among billions,

3
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:10,890
and it's been the backbone for protests around the world.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,189
But a new bill proposes to give the power to censor the Internet

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,852
to the entertainment industry.

6
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:20,130
It's called PROTECT IP, and here's how it works.

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,359
Private corporations want the ability to shut down unauthorized sites

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,528
where people download movies, TV shows, and music.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,634
Since most of these sites are outside US jurisdiction,

10
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:35,822
PROTECT IP uses a couple different tactics within American borders.

11
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,045
Firstly, it gives the government the power to make

12
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:42,560
US Internet providers block access to infringing domain names.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,140
They can also sue US-based search engines,

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,438
directories, or even blogs and forums,

15
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:50,071
to have links to these sites removed.

16
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,060
Secondly, PROTECT IP gives corporations and

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,474
the government the ability to cut off funds to

18
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,934
infringing websites by having US-based advertisers

19
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,674
and payment services cancel those accounts.

20
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:04,356
In a nutshell, that's what PROTECT IP will try to do.

21
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,828
But in all likelihood, it'll do something else altogether.

22
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:12,236
For starters, it won't stop downloaders.

23
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:14,324
You'll still be able to access a blocked site

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:18,245
just by entering its IP address instead of its name.

25
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,456
What PROTECT IP will do is cripple new startups

26
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,042
because it also lets companies sue any site

27
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,795
they feel isn't doing their filtering well enough.

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,590
These lawsuits could easily bankrupt new search engines

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,508
and social media sites.

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,136
And PROTECT IP's wording is ambiguous enough

31
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,734
that important social media sites could become

32
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:37,556
targets.

33
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,875
Lots of trailblazing websites could look like

34
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,456
piracy heavens to the wrong judge.

35
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:45,265
Tumblr, SoundCloud, an early YouTube,

36
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,274
wherever people express themselves, make art,

37
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,027
broadcast news or organize protests,

38
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,477
there's plenty of TV footage, movie clips,

39
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,903
and copyrighted music mixed in.

40
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,518
And even if you trust the US government

41
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:58,905
not to abuse their new power to censor the Net,

42
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:01,054
what about the countries that follow in our path

43
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,664
and pass similar laws?

44
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,470
People around the world will have very different

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,122
Internets, and unscrupulous governments will have

46
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:09,463
powerful tools to hinder free expression.

47
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,865
But perhaps most dangerously, PROTECT IP will

48
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,477
meddle with the inner workings of the Net.

49
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:18,085
Experts believe by fiddling with the web's registry

50
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,724
of domain names, the result will be less security,

51
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,225
and less stability.

52
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,515
In short, PROTECT IP won't stop piracy, but it will

53
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:28,515
introduce vast potential for censorship and abuse,

54
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,696
while making the web less safe and less reliable.

55
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,943
This is the Internet we're talking about!

56
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:36,281
It's a vital and vibrant medium.

57
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,075
And our government is tampering with its

58
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,462
basic structure, so people will maybe buy more

59
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,163
Hollywood movies.

60
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,957
But Hollywood movies don't get grassroots candidates

61
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,623
elected. They don't overthrow corrupt regimes,

62
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:51,363
and the entire entertainment industry doesn't even

63
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:53,523
contribute that much to our economy.

64
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,551
The Internet does all these, and more.

65
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,347
Corporations already have tools to fight piracy.

66
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,766
They have the power to take down specific content,

67
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,894
to sue peer-to-peer software companies out of existence,

68
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,885
and to sue journalists just for talking about how to

69
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,397
copy a DVD.

70
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:12,901
They have a history of stretching and abusing

71
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,343
their powers. They tried to take a baby video

72
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,489
off YouTube, just for the music playing in

73
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,825
the background. They've used legal penalties

74
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,269
written for large-scale commercial piracy

75
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,663
to go after families and children.

76
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,124
They even sued to ban the VCR and the first

77
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,747
MP3 players.

78
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:33,090
So the question is, "How far will they take all this?"

79
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,924
The answer at this point, is obvious.

80
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,712
As far as we'll let them.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the correct answer is all of those--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
finance, robotics, games, medicine, the Web, and many more applications.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So let me talk about them in some detail.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There is a huge number of applications of artificial intelligence in finance,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
very often in the shape of making trading decisions--

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in which case, the agent is called a trading agent.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the environment might be things like the stock market or the bond market

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
or the commodities market.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And our trading agent can sense the course of certain things,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
like the stock or bonds or commodities.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It can also read the news online and follow certain events.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And its decisions are usually things like buy or sell decisions--trades.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There's a huge history of artificial intelligence finding methods to look at data over time

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and make predictions as to how courses develop over time--

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and then put in trades behind those.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And very frequently, people using artificial intelligence trading agents

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
have made a good amount of money with superior trading decisions.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There's also a long history of AI in Robotics.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here is my depiction of a robot.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Of course, there are many different types of robots

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and they all interact with their environments through their sensors,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which include things like cameras, microphones, tactile sensor or touch.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And the way they impact their environments is to move motors around,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
in particular, their wheels, their legs, their arms, their grippers.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They can also say things to people using voice.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now there's a huge history of using artificial intelligence in robotics.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Pretty much, every robot that does something interesting today uses AI.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In fact, often AI has been studied together with robotics, as one discipline.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But because robots are somewhat special in that they use physical actuators

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and deal with physical environments, they are a little bit different from

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
just artificial intelligence, as a whole.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When the Web came out, the early Web crawlers were called robots

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and to block a robot from accessing your website, to the present day,

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
there's a file called robot.txt, that allows you to deny any Web crawler

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to access and retrieve that information from your website.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So historically, robotics played a huge role in artificial intelligence

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and a good chunk of this class will be focusing on robotics.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
AI has a huge history in games--

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to make games smarter or feel more natural.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There are 2 ways in which AI has been used in games, as a game agent.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
One is to play against you, as a human user.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So for example, if you play the game of Chess,

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
then you are the environment to the game agent.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The game agent gets to observe your moves, and it generates its own moves

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
with the purpose of defeating you in Chess.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So most adversarial games, where you play against an opponent

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and the opponent is a computer program,

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the game agent is built to play against you--against your own interests--and make you lose.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And of course, your objective is to win.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's an AI games-type situation.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The second thing is that games agents in AI

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
also are used to make games feel more natural.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So very often games have characters inside, and these characters act in some way.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it's important for you, as the player, to feel that these characters are believable.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's an entire sub-field of artificial intelligence to use AI

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to make characters in a game more believable--look smarter, so to speak--

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
so that you, as a player, think you're playing a better game.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Artificial intelligence has a long history in medicine as well.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The classic example is that of a diagnostic agent.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So here you are--and you might be sick, and you go to your doctor.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And your doctor wishes to understand

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
what the reason for your symptoms and your sickness is.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The diagnostic agent will observe you through various measurements--

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
for example, blood pressure and heart signals, and so on--

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and it'll come up with the hypothesis as to what you might be suffering from.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But rather than intervene directly, in most cases the diagnostic of your disease

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is communicated to the doctor, who then takes on the intervention.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is called a diagnostic agent.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There are many other versions of AI in medicine.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AI is used in intensive care to understand whether there are situations

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that need immediate attention.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's been used for life-long medicine to monitor signs over long periods of time.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And as medicine becomes more personal, the role of artificial intelligence

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
will definitely increase.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We already mentioned AI on the Web.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The most generic version of AI is to crawl the Web and understand the Web,

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and assist you in answering questions.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So when you have this search box over here

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and it says "Search" on the left,

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and "I'm Feeling Lucky" on the right,

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and you type in the words,

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
what AI does for you is it understands what words you typed in

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and finds the most relevant pages.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That is really co-artificial intelligence.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's used by a number of companies, such as Microsoft and Google

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and Amazon, Yahoo, and many others.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And the way this works is that there's a crawling agent that can go

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to the World Wide Web and retrieve pages, through just a computer program.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It then sorts these pages into a big database inside the crawler

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and also analyzes developments of each page to any possible query.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When you then come and issue a query,

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the AI system is able to give you a response--

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
for example, a collection of 10 best Web links.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
In short, every time you try to write a piece of software,

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that makes your computer software smart

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
likely you will need artificial intelligence.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And in this class, Peter and I will teach you

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
many of the basic tricks of the trade

99
00:06:25,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to make your software really smart.

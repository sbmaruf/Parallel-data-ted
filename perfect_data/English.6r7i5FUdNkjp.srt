00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,530
Welcome to the presentation on finding the equation of a line.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,410
Let's get started.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,340
Say I had two points.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,350
Let's say I have the point one comma two, and I have the point three

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,350
comma four, and I want to figure out the equation of the

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,350
line through these points.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,630
So let's at least figure out what that line looks like.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:32,490
So one comma two is here, and two, three; three, four.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,130
three comma four is here, and if I want to draw a line

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,040
through them, it'll look something like that.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,360
So what we want to do is figure out the equation of this line.

12
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,430
Well, we know the form of an equation of a line is y equals

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,830
mx plus b, where m is the slope, and that tells you how

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,610
steep the line is, and b is the y-intercept.

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,420
And I don't know why people chose m and b.

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,970
We'll have to do some research on that.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,260
b is the y-intercept and the y-intercept is just where does

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,240
it intersect the y-axis.

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,040
And this problem, you could actually look at it and

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,930
figure it out, but let's do it mathematically.

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,380
So the equation for the slope m: it's rise over run.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,640
Another way to view that is for any amount that you

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,680
run along the x-axis, how much do you rise?

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,340
Well, let's do that numerically.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,420
Rise is the same thing as change over y, and run is the

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,790
same thing as change over x.

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,550
Delta, this triangle, means change, change in y.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,640
Well, change in y, let's take the starting

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,270
point to be three comma four.

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,980
Let's say we're going from three comma four to two comma one.

31
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,070
The change in y is four minus two.

32
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:01,820
We just took this four minus this two over three minus one.

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,530
My phone was ringing.

34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,750
And that's just this three minus this one.

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,550
So if we just solve for it, we get four minus two is two, and three

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,270
minus one is also two, so we get the slope is equal to one.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,280
And that makes sense because when we move over one in x,

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,270
we go up exactly one in y.

39
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,780
When we move to the left one in x, we move down exactly one in y.

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,480
So now we know the equation is y equals onex plus b because

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,870
we solved the m equals one.

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,570
And this is, of course, the same thing as

43
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,190
y equals x plus b.

44
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,750
Now, all we have left to do is solve for b.

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,540
Well, how do we do that because we have three variables here.

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,450
Well, we could actually substitute one of these pairs

47
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,770
of points in for y and x, and that makes sense, because

48
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,500
these points have to satisfy this equation.

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,590
So let's take this first pair. y is equal to two.

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,350
two is equal to x, which is one plus b.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,150
It's a pretty easy equation to solve.

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,170
We get b equals one, so that tells us that the equation of

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,060
this line is y equals x plus one.

54
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,480
That's a pretty straightforward equation, and it makes sense.

55
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,360
The y-intercept is one, which is exactly here, zero comma

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,090
one, and the slope is one, and that's pretty obvious.

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,680
For every amount that we move to the right, we move the same

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,140
amount up, so the slope is one.

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,110
Let's do another problem.

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,190
Let's say I wanted to find the equation of the line between

61
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:49,340
the points negative three comma five and two comma negative six.

62
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,240
Well, we do the same thing.

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,680
m is equal to change in y over change in x.

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,610
So let's take this as the starting point.

65
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,940
So say negative six minus five.

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,290
So we just took negative six minus five over two

67
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,830
minus negative three.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,650
You've got to be real careful to get the signs right.

69
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,830
So it's two minus negative three.

70
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:22,470
Negative six minus five is minus eleven, and two minus negative three, well,

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,340
that's the same thing as two plus plus three, so that's five.

72
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,360
So we have the slope is equal to negative eleven / five.

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,440
And notice that if on the numerator we use negative six as

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,620
the starting point, that in the denominator, we have to use

75
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,930
two as the starting point.

76
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,070
We could have done it the other way around.

77
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,230
We could have said five minus negative six over negative three

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,060
minus two, in which case we would have gotten-- this would have

79
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,560
been eleven over negative five.

80
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,290
So as long as you-- if you use the negative six first, then you

81
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,830
have to use the two first, or if you use the five first, then

82
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,870
you have to use the negative three first.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,070
I hope I'm not completely confusing you guys.

84
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,490
Well, anyway, we know the slope is negative eleven / five, so the

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,680
equation of this line so far is y equals minus eleven / fivex plus b.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,410
Now we can take one of these pairs on the top and substitute

87
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,080
back and solve for b.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,750
Let's take the first pair.

89
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,370
So five is y.

90
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:33,310
So we say five equals negative three, so it's negative eleven / five

91
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,740
times negative three, right?

92
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,220
I just put the x in for x plus b.

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:48,440
So just simplifying that, I get five is equal to thirty-three / five plus b, or b

94
00:05:48,440 --> 00:06:01,820
is equal to five minus thirty-three / five, and this equals twenty-five minus thirty-three / five.

95
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,450
twenty-five minus thirty-three is minus eight / five.

96
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,570
So the equation of this line, and this one wasn't as clean as

97
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,320
the other one, obviously, is-- let me do it in another color

98
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:23,790
for emphasis-- y equals minus eleven / fivex minus eight / five.

99
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,510
Hopefully, those two examples will give you enough of an idea

100
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,560
to do the figuring out the equation of a line problems.

101
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,810
And if you have problems with this, you might just want to

102
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,740
try just the slope of the line problems or the y-intercept

103
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,170
problems separately.

104
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,160
I hope you have fun.

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,450
Bye.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,770
Let's say we need to figure
out how many times 16 goes

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,221
into 1,388.

4
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,720
And what I want to
do is first think

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,970
about how we traditionally
solve a problem like this

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,630
and then introduce
another method that

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,450
allows for a little
bit more approximation.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,990
So traditionally you would say,
well, 16 does not go into 1

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,700
any times.

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,210
So then you move over one spot.

11
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,970
Well, how many times
does it go into 13?

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,700
Well, it still does
not go into 13.

13
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,830
And then you go
all the way to 138.

14
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,990
And you say, well,
16 does go into 138.

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,830
And you say, how many
times will it go into 138?

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,619
And you might try 9 first.

17
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,340
And I'll do all my arithmetic
here on the right side.

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:44,550
So you'll say, 16 times
9-- 6 times 9 is 54.

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,270

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,830
1 times 9 is 9, plus 5 is 14.

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,050
So it goes 144 times.

22
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,170
So that's still too big.

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,060
That's larger than 138.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,230
So it's going to go
into it eight times.

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,370
Eight times will
be less than 138.

26
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,630
So you would stick an 8 here.

27
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,660
And notice, I had to do this
little trial and error here.

28
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,650
I had to make sure I got
the right exact number.

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,566
I had to make sure I put
an 8 right over here.

30
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:12,410
Then you say, 8 times 6 is 48.

31
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,880
And then 8 times 1
is 8, plus 4 is 12.

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,750
So 8 times 16 is 128.

33
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,680
So when I subtract, I get
the remainder from 138.

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,300
So I get a remainder
of 8 minus 8 is 0.

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,790
3 minus 2 is 1.

36
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,024
And then these cancel out.

37
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,190
So I have a remainder of 10.

38
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,960
But I still have this
8 right over here,

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,010
so I bring that down.

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,590
So I have 108.

41
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,090
And then I do the
same thing again.

42
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,173
Let me get rid of this so
we don't get distracted.

43
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:42,640
We say, how many times
does 16 go into 108?

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,952
And you can approximate.

45
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,910
You say, well, it's
definitely not eight times.

46
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,280
Eight times is 128.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,911
Is it, maybe, seven times?

48
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:50,910
And then you might do a
little math on the side.

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,220
See-- 16 times 7.

50
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,442
6 times 7 is 42.

51
00:01:55,442 --> 00:02:03,180
1 times 7 is 7, plus 4 is 11.

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,060
So you get 112.

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,280
So that's still too large,
so it's going to be 6.

54
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,430
But notice, we had to
do this little side work

55
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,490
on the side right over here
to realize it wasn't seven.

56
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,910
Now six is the
largest how many times

57
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,700
you go into 108
without going over it.

58
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,691
So 6 times 6 is 36.

59
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:22,150
Carry the 3, or regroup
the 3, depending

60
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,240
on how you think about it.

61
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,830
6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9.

62
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,140

63
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,340
Then you subtract again.

64
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,720
8 minus 6 is 2.

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,079
And then you can just
say 10 minus 9 is 1,

66
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,120
or you could even borrow.

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,161
You could make this a 10.

68
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,610
And then that goes away.

69
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,050
10 minus 9 is 1.

70
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,187
So then you have 12.

71
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,270
And if we're not going
into decimals, you're done.

72
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,340
Because 16 does not go into 12.

73
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,392
So 16 goes into 1,388 86
times with a remainder of 12.

74
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:55,370
That right over there
is your remainder.

75
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,500
And that's all a
decent way of doing it.

76
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
And that's the way
you traditionally

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,770
know how to do it.

78
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,670
But what I want
to do is introduce

79
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,580
another maybe a little
more interesting way

80
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,380
to solve a
long-division problem.

81
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:11,679
So once again, let's do
our 16 goes into 1,388.

82
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,220
And what we're going
to do is give us

83
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,510
much more leeway
for approximation,

84
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,940
or for essentially guessing.

85
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,610
And what we want to
do is just guess.

86
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,780
We're going to make
guesses for how many times

87
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,750
16 goes into the numbers
without overestimating,

88
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,470
without jumping too high.

89
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,280
And now we're not
just going to think

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,430
about the 1 or
the 13 or the 138.

91
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,040
We're going to think about
the whole number as a whole.

92
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,290
And before we do that, I'm
going to get two things out

93
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,990
of the way, just
because it will help us.

94
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,406
I'm just going to
remind ourselves

95
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,767
what 16 times 2
and 16 times 5 are.

96
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,600
And I'm just picking
these as random numbers

97
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,260
that we can use to approximate.

98
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,530
You don't have to use 2 and 5.

99
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,530
You can use any numbers.

100
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,210
Maybe I'll show
other examples there.

101
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,740
So 16 times 2, we know, is 32.

102
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,180
And 16 times 5 is
50 plus 30, is 80.

103
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,430
So let's just keep these
two results in mind

104
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,476
while we try to tackle
this right over here.

105
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,850
So the first thing
to think about

106
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,072
is our best guess for how many
times does 16 go into 1,388.

107
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,280
Or another way to think
about, how many times does 16

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,390
go into 1,000?

109
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,769
Let's just do something at
a very rough approximation.

110
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,570
Well, we know it's not going
to be 100, because 100 times 16

111
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,810
would be 1,600.

112
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,990
You would just throw those
two 0's at the end of it.

113
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,480
And [? you'd ?] say, how many
times does it go into 1,000?

114
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,436
Well, we know if 16 times 5 is
80, we know that 16 times 50

115
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:41,455
would be 800.

116
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,650
So let's use that.

117
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,490
And I'm using the 5-- I'm
multiplying it by another 10

118
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,730
to get to 50-- instead of the
2 because 800 is a lot closer

119
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,090
than 320 to our 1,000
that we care about.

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:01,041
So what we could say is, well,
16 times 50 will get us to 800.

121
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,540
And once again, how
did I know that?

122
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,330
Well, 16 times 5, I know
ahead of time, is 80.

123
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,200
So 16 times 50, I
multiplied by 10-- 5 times

124
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
10-- it'll get us to 800.

125
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,385
And then I just subtract.

126
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,690
So I subtract here.

127
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,160
8 minus 0 is 8.

128
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,990
And then you could
say 13 minus 5 is 588.

129
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,600
And now we ask ourselves, how
many times does 16 go into 588?

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,844
How close can we get to that?

131
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:28,260
And let's just
assume that we only

132
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,843
know this stuff right
over here, or we

133
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,480
can multiply 16 times
a multiple of 10.

134
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,646
So 800 would once
again be too big.

135
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:36,995
That gets us above 588.

136
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:41,680
Let's just go with
320 right over here.

137
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,122
We know that 16 times 2 is 32.

138
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:50,140
So 16 times 20 is
going to be 320.

139
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,200
I just multiplied
the 2 times 10,

140
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,470
which would give us
our product times 10.

141
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,060
And so we can subtract
this right over here.

142
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,092
8 minus 0 is 8.

143
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,710
8 minus 2 is 6.

144
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,840
And then 5 minus 3 is 2.

145
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,570
So now I'm left with 268.

146
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,262
And we say, how many
times does 16 go into 268?

147
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:14,154

148
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:15,210
Well, let's see.

149
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,270
800 is too big.

150
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,740
Even 320 is now too big.

151
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Well, we could say-- 10
times 16 will get us to 160.

152
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Let's just try that out.

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,760
We don't even have to get
the right exact answer.

154
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,590
We don't have to get the highest
multiple that's less than 260.

155
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,070
We just have to make sure
that we're still within 268.

156
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,060
Let me do a new color over here.

157
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,370
If we multiply 16
times 10, we get 160.

158
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,270
160, we subtract again.

159
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,896
So 8 minus 0 is 8.

160
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,620
6 minus 6 is 0.

161
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,560
2 minus 1 is 1.

162
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
And then we're left with,
well, how many times

163
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,010
does 16 go into 108?

164
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,710
And we know 16 times 5 is 80.

165
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,860
So let's just try out 5.

166
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,810
16 times 5 is 80.

167
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,750
We subtract right over here.

168
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,992
8 minus 0 is 8.

169
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,480
10 minus 8 is 2.

170
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,806
So we're left with 28.

171
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:08,930
And now it's pretty simple.

172
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,680
How many times
does 16 go into 28?

173
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,185
Well, it only goes
into it one time.

174
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:20,050
And then when you subtract
16 from 28, 8 minus 6 is 2.

175
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,520
2 minus 1 is 1.

176
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,604
You're left with
a remainder of 12.

177
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:25,020
But you might say,
well, how do we

178
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,520
know how many times
does 16 go into 1,388?

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,410
Well, it goes 50 times
plus 20 times plus 10 times

180
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,520
plus 5 times plus 1 time.

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,810
So that's going to
be-- we can just add up

182
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,840
all of these things on
the right-hand side.

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,860
This is going to be 50 plus
20 is 70, plus 10 is 80,

184
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,000
plus 5 is 85, plus 1 is 86.

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,100
So there we have it.

186
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,130
It went into it 86 times
with a remainder of 12.

187
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,610
And what's cool about this
method is that at every step,

188
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,230
I could have put a
60 over here and I

189
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,730
could have done
the math correctly.

190
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,390
Or I could have picked my
two multiples to be 16 times

191
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,382
6 and 16 times 3.

192
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,340
And I would have gotten
different results here.

193
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,300
But at the end, I would still
have gotten the right answer.

194
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,640
So what it does is it gives us
a method so that we're always

195
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,780
thinking about-- we're
always kind of biting away

196
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,940
chunks of what
we're dividing into.

197
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,610
So first we bit off
an 800-piece chunk.

198
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,300
Then we bit off a
320-piece chunk.

199
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,660
And we keep going
until we essentially

200
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,650
can't divide by 16 any more.

201
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,890
So hopefully you found
that kind of interesting.

You scared me.

20
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:26,204
I can't concentrate because of you.

21
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:29,707
It's not the first timeyou've heard this.

22
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:32,710
My eardrums are gonna pop!

23
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,946
Doesn't this sound great?

24
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,416
After your military service,I thought you'd grow up.

25
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:43,020
Anyway, you can't car race.It's too dangerous.

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,423
Hey, Dae-jin.

27
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:48,359
Look for other work whilehelping me out like old times.

28
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,029
Your work is just as dangerous.

29
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:55,766
You always cut your hand.

30
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:59,604
Over 10,000 people diea year from car accidents.

31
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:00,738
But I haven't seen anyone

32
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:10,648
die from a car race yet.

33
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:19,390
Ho-jin. Step aside.

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,225
You worry too much.

35
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,394
I can't die that easily.

36
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:31,802
Be careful.

37
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:35,239
Mr. Choi, checkthe singers' MR tape.

38
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,240
Okay.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,210
Mr. Jun, checkthe moving lights.

40
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,146
Take a look.

41
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,481
OK!

42
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,717
Mr. Choi, checkthe monitor speaker.

43
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:50,054
- Please hurry. Over here.- Yes.

44
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:51,889
Go inside the domeinstead of Hyun-woo.

45
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:52,657
Yes.

46
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:54,959
It has to be checked properly.

47
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,728
It has to open during the concert.

48
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,964
Why not? It'll be fun.

49
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:04,769
Sure. Getting trapped insteadwould be fun, huh?

50
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,573
- It won't open!- Open it up!

51
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:27,491
I didn't do it.

52
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,561
Don't turn on the master so fast.

53
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:45,743
Thanks.

54
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,879
Hello?

55
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,483
Yes. Really?

56
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:55,319
From the 16th to the 18th?

57
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,091
Yes. But the exhibitionwill last for only three days.

58
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,559
Yes.

59
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,061
I'd like it to be for a week though.

60
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,496
Yes.

61
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:07,998
Then please ask around again.

62
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:42,967
Thank you. Bye.

63
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,771
How'd you time it perfectly?It's pouring.

64
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:51,642
- Hungry, huh?- Yes.

65
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,044
This song.

66
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,713
Don't you remember it?

67
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,783
It's my favorite song.

68
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:01,419
It's nice hearing it in the rain.

69
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,688
Here. It's a present.

70
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,858
What's with you today?Thank you.

71
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:11,962
That's all?

72
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:28,612
I love you.

73
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:32,082
What's this?What's gotten into you today?

74
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,084
You made all this?

75
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:36,287
Of course.

76
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,325
But it's not my birthday,and yours is much later than mine.

77
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,093
Hey, Eun-soo.

78
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:45,930
It's our anniversary, dummy.

79
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,266
My goodness, you're right.

80
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:53,771
I totally forgot.I'm sorry, Ho-jin.

81
00:06:53,771 --> 00:07:03,781
There's one more thing.

82
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:06,851
It's the most valuable thing to you,

83
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:13,491
but the chain wasalways a problem.

84
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:17,595
Eun-soo, I love you.

85
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:21,699
Honey. It's like as if my dadsent you to me.

86
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,801
Why?

87
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,603
Whatever my dad makes,

88
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:29,273
it becomes preciousno matter how trifling it is.

89
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:32,042
Even this necklace,

90
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:35,246
he made it out of peach flowerseeds when I was a kid.

91
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,182
I know. That's why youdeserve this much.

92
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:41,719
There's only onelike this in the world, huh?

93
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,056
But I'm sorryI didn't prepare anything.

94
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:51,562
Then how about I steamyou up tonight?

95
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,197
Really? Tonight?

96
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:58,202
Sure.

97
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:02,606
Bastard.What perfect timing.

98
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,743
He's too big to live with us, huh?Shall we get him married?

99
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:06,377
Shall we?

100
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,178
Yeah.

101
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:11,215
But right after I said it,

102
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:14,184
it really didn't open.I'm serious.

103
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,719
No way.

104
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,422
I must have sometelekinetic power.

105
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,357
Do it.

106
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,725
Do what?

107
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:22,893
Do it.

108
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,496
Okay, I'll give it a try.

109
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:29,066
Look straight into my eyes.

110
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:37,274
Yawn. Should I do iton Dae-jin, too?

111
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:41,712
Hiccups.

112
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:49,920
Sorry, I guess I can't.

113
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,523
He did it.

114
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,058
I really had to.

115
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:55,526
- It switched.- Stop joking around.

116
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:56,627
No, it was real.

117
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,396
Don't joke with...

118
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:00,731
Come on.

119
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,166
No, mine was real, too.

120
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,100
It was real?

121
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,668
Yeah.

122
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:05,869
I'll go drink some water.

123
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:06,904
Come here.

124
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,440
No, I have togo drink some water.

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,108
Stop joking around.

126
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:19,950
I'm serious.

127
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:27,157
Dae-jin, don't you want a girlfriend?

128
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:31,595
The best times are at your age.

129
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,297
I like it now.

130
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,099
Like what?

131
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:41,005
Fiddling with your carin the garage?

132
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:50,948
I'm curious as to what's inthat mind of yours.

133
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:54,018
I'm going to bedso you two drink up.

134
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,753
- Good night.- You, too.

135
00:09:55,753 --> 00:10:21,779
I'll be in soon.

136
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,347
Dae-jin.

137
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:30,688
Make sure youblock your ears tonight.

138
00:10:30,688 --> 00:11:15,833
- Good night.- You, too.

139
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:29,313
I've never seen you neat freakwho can't close a lid right.

140
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,248
Thanks a lot for today.

141
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:34,918
It's nothing.

142
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:43,961
I'm so happy.

143
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,196
You still have the hiccups?

144
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:51,769
No, I'm okay.

145
00:11:51,769 --> 00:12:08,685
You still have them. There's nouse tonight. Let's just go to bed.

146
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,455
It stopped.

147
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,589
It stopped?

148
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:13,657
It did.

149
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:17,795
Really?

150
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:22,299
You're doing it again.

151
00:12:22,299 --> 00:13:10,814
Just go to sleep.

152
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,249
Ho-jin.

153
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,183
Yeah.

154
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,819
You're supposed toput it all the way on.

155
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:23,060
That's because it's used up.I'll buy it later.

156
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,933
I think a lot of reportersare coming to my exhibition.

157
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:34,705
Dae-jin. Act like a reporterand ask me questions.

158
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:36,073
So I can practice.

159
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,475
Come on, that's dumb.

160
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,578
Just this once.

161
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,316
Mr. Hwang Ho-jin,please explain your work.

162
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:50,587
Yes. From the furniturewe commonly see,

163
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:53,257
I felt like I twisted them a little.

164
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:56,093
Similar to Marcel Duchamp's toilet,

165
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:59,162
I recreated whatwe commonly see.

166
00:13:59,162 --> 00:13:59,563
Furniture...

167
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:03,033
Ho-jin. You practiced a lot, huh?

168
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,134
Does it show?

169
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,436
Of course.

170
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:08,672
Be a little artsy and inarticulate.

171
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:12,109
As if it just came to you,

172
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,577
and say 'and' a lot.

173
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:17,881
Also, smiling and liftingyour eyes is better.

174
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,216
You're right.

175
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,450
Do it again.

176
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:26,790
Mr. Hwang Ho-jin,please describe your work.

177
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,996
Yes. From the furniture...

178
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:36,199
we commonly see...

179
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:37,901
How can I put it?

180
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:43,807
I twisted them a little.That is...

181
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,576
Ho-jin.

182
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,211
Just do it like before.

183
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:53,383
Bastard.

184
00:14:53,383 --> 00:15:00,457
You did well.

185
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:01,525
Oh, hi.

186
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,160
What are you doing?

187
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,430
They say pollacks can look farwith their big eyes,

188
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,299
and can eat a lotwith their big mouths.

189
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,902
Then how could theyget caught then?

190
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:14,972
You're right.

191
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:17,474
If I get hungry while driving,I'm gonna eat it.

192
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:21,278
Do as you please.

193
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,747
Whether you cook or fry it,

194
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:26,583
I'll put it here for your sake,

195
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,554
so be careful.

196
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:36,860
Thanks, Ho-jin.

197
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,130
Ho-jin. It's your favorite dish.

198
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,597
Hey.

199
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:41,732
Is Dae-jin still in the garage?

200
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:48,772
Wait. Wait.

201
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,441
What are you doing?

202
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,244
I don't have the hiccups today.

203
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,980
So what? What if Dae-jin comes?

204
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:20,704
He's leaving soon.

205
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:26,009
Wait. Is it bothering you?

206
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:27,477
Do something with the table.

207
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:54,604
Okay, just a sec.

208
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,039
Aren't you going to fast?

209
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:08,018
I can handle it.

210
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:11,254
He's taking it too hardfrom the beginning.

211
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:13,790
I told him to pace himselfand go slow.

212
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,225
Would a drug addict listen

213
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:24,901
if you said to inject slowly?

214
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:26,436
What's he doing?

215
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:27,471
I don't know.

216
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:49,459
Might be engine trouble.

217
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:53,063
You exhausted the engine.

218
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:57,567
The race isn't far away,so don't blow the engine.

219
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,269
Don't use too much RPM.

220
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,605
I didn't overdo it.It'll be fine.

221
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:04,674
Your record's improving,so I'll let it pass.

222
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:07,344
But racing isn't all about luck.Take caution.

223
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:14,985
I got it. Hey, the car's in great shape.

224
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:22,125
Damn it. I should've beenborn a car.

225
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:41,978
Good job everyone.

226
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:48,485
A coin that brought you pleasure?

227
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:49,753
Eun-soo.

228
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,654
Huh?

229
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:52,856
You got another love letter today?

230
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,258
You're so lucky.

231
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,826
For what?

232
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,728
You've been marriedfor three years,

233
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:01,164
but you still exchange love letters?

234
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,366
You're so lucky, Eun-soo.

235
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:06,036
I wish I could meeta guy like that.

236
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:08,038
It won't be too easy.

237
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,174
Can't there bea guy like Ho-jin?

238
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:41,404
What?

239
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:46,676
Ho-jin. But the letter'snot finished.

240
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:59,856
That's okay.

241
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,424
- Sleep well?- Oh, yes.

242
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,892
You must've came inlate last night.

243
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:05,295
Yeah, I had a drink with Yae-joo.

244
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:07,030
I'm out of lotion,so I came for Ho-jin's.

245
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:22,012
- It's on the dresser.- Okay.

246
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,614
That's our business, Dae-jin.

247
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,750
It was just here,but I wasn't looking at it.

248
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,085
If you're done,then please leave.

249
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:31,921
We live in the same house,but you two are unfair.

250
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:33,890
So hurry and get married.

251
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:52,008
Okay.

252
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,710
Ho-jin.

253
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,644
Look at this.

254
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,346
Hello.

255
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:57,213
Hello.

256
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:58,381
You're here early, Yae-joo.

257
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:00,950
Of course. It's an important dayfor Dae-jin.

258
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,186
You're the only onewho thinks of him.

259
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:06,423
Ho-jin, this came off.

260
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:08,425
I'll fix it later.

261
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:12,228
The more I see it,the prettier it is.

262
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,964
There's only onelike this in the world.

263
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:17,500
I'm so jealous.

264
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,470
- Stay for a while.- Okay.

265
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,239
You and Dae-jinseem to hit it off.

266
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:27,344
I wish. It was betterwhen he took pictures.

267
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,412
I feel like I'm leftin the cold now.

268
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:31,781
He always worries mewhen he car races.

269
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:33,917
You should change his mind.

270
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:38,321
Think he will if I tell him?

271
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:40,890
Hey, am I invisible now?

272
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:51,501
- What's up?- Hey.

273
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:54,070
Ho-jin, I'm leaving now.

274
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,739
- You're going now?- Yeah.

275
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,006
Going to the race, right?

276
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:58,274
Of course.

277
00:21:58,274 --> 00:21:59,709
Tell him good luck for me.

278
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,243
I will.

279
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:01,578
I'll see you later.

280
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:10,587
Be careful driving.

281
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,755
See you later.

282
00:22:11,755 --> 00:23:21,658
- Have a nice day.- Okay.

283
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:41,211
Oh no.

284
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,079
Drivers please come to

285
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,882
the record room for tests.

286
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,518
Five minutes leftuntil the race begins.

287
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:50,119
Did Ho-jin say he'll come?

288
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,354
Yeah, he did.

289
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:56,125
He doesn't like me racing,so he might not.

290
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,496
Then why are youif your brother opposes it?

291
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:00,563
Because I like it.

292
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,099
Drivers please reportto the waiting area.

293
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:09,405
Hey, good luck!

294
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,106
Welcome.

295
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:12,275
To Yongin Speedway please.

296
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:16,179
I'm very late.I have to be there by one.

297
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:17,981
Wow, you're really late.

298
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:20,950
I'll go fast.

299
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,620
It's the thirdKorea Motor Championship.

300
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,957
1st place in the GT Class,Indigo's Kim Yi-soo.

301
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:31,094
He took pole positionin the last match.

302
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:35,131

303
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,100
Fourth was Hwang Dae-jin.

304
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,368
Feeling good, huh?

305
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:40,570
- And don't pass upthe in course.- Okay.

306
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,673
Remember, you're buying tonight.

307
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:44,307
I know.

308
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:46,209
Three minutes left until the race.

309
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,243
The gates are closing.

310
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:50,246
Please clear awayfrom the grid.

311
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,515
The sign board is up.

312
00:24:52,515 --> 00:25:37,660
Start your engines.

313
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,630
I screwed up on corner three.What's my time?

314
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,266
Present lap time is 1:08:07.

315
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:59,015
You're doing alright.

316
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,950
Aren't you going too fast?

317
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,752
I thought you were late.

318
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,554
Right.

319
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:05,555
Don't worry.

320
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:17,734
I've been accident free for 10 years.Even as a speed taxi.

321
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:43,860
It's the 7th head pin,so slow it down.

322
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:51,167
He wants to kill himself!He's scaring me!

323
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,503
The steering wheel is strange.I'm going in.

324
00:26:53,503 --> 00:27:02,512
Hurry up!

325
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:03,279
What happened?

326
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,580
The steering wheelshakes too much.

327
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,448
Check the tires fast.

328
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:06,649
Check the tires!

329
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:26,703
Dae-jin, please be careful.

330
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:28,004
How much am I behind?

331
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:30,273
0.3 seconds behind in lap time.

332
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,774
Run the courseinstead of placing.

333
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:34,177
No, I have to place.

334
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:52,995
You still have more to go,so it's okay. Be careful.

335
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:57,900
The traffic lightsaren't cooperating today.

336
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,937
Dae-jin, there's troubleon the course. Slow down!

337
00:28:00,937 --> 00:28:01,704
Dae-jin!

338
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:05,608
What? What did you say?

339
00:28:05,608 --> 00:29:25,154
I can't hear you well.

340
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:28,191
His pulse rate andbrain waves are improving,

341
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:31,627
but he still can't wake up.It's too bad.

342
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:34,797
Dr. Lee, what happenedto this patient?

343
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:37,200
Didn't I tell you?

344
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,469
Both brothers got intoa car accident.

345
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:43,639
His older brother got hitby a truck while in a taxi.

346
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:45,408
So he's pretty much dead.

347
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,311
I guess so.

348
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,745
But the younger one

349
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:52,715
was in a car race accident.

350
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:56,152
What a strange world.

351
00:29:56,152 --> 00:30:00,323
But is there any hopefor this patient?

352
00:30:00,323 --> 00:33:16,419
I don't know.

353
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,520
Are you okay?

354
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,223
Jung-woo, match the steps.You're falling back.

355
00:33:21,223 --> 00:33:27,196
You're supposed to turn there.

356
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,398
Young-eun!

357
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:40,910
Are you checkingthe distance? They're off.

358
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:50,486
Mr. Kim, please check the lights.There are shadows onthe models' faces.

359
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:58,227
Hello? Oh, hello.

360
00:33:58,227 --> 00:35:19,241
What?

361
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:29,285
Please rest for now.

362
00:35:29,285 --> 00:36:24,106
It's really fortunate thatyou at least have come back.

363
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:26,809
Are you okay?

364
00:36:26,809 --> 00:38:39,408
Get up.Go rest in your room.

365
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:46,648
Hey, Dae-jin!

366
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:49,551
Thanks for being alive.

367
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:52,755
You were lying therelike a corpse,

368
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:58,494
and I was helpless,thinking you'd leave forever.

369
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:13,642
I'm just really happythat you're alive.

370
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:21,950
You were a heavy smoker before.

371
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,454
While you were in bed,know how stupid I acted?

372
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:29,425
I went all the wayto the junkyard.

373
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:35,297
I wanted to see your carget totally demolished.

374
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:42,938
When I went to see it,I laughed a lot.

375
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:46,308
You were in bed like that,

376
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:49,478
and I was jealous of that car.

377
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:54,016
I was acting overboard.

378
00:39:54,016 --> 00:40:01,390
But now

379
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:35,657
I'm just really thankfulthat you've come back.

380
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:36,692
Yae-joo.

381
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:45,667
Hi, Eun-soo.Is Dae-jin really alright?

382
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,035
Dae-jin.

383
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:53,008
What are you doing?

384
00:40:53,008 --> 00:41:01,884
Have a seat.

385
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:05,020
Did you buy that flower?

386
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:13,028
No. I thought you bought it.

387
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:16,064
Was Dae-jin always a good cook?

388
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:32,114
The way he cutsvegetables is amazing.

389
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:47,763
Sit. Yae-joo, too.

390
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:49,998
Hurry and eat.

391
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:51,500
Dae-jin.

392
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:51,426
Right now, this is all thatI can do for you. Now eat.

393
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:57,666
Dae-jin.

394
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:18,320
Dae-jin...

395
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,555
Mr. Hwang Dae-jin.

396
00:43:20,555 --> 00:43:25,560
- After you woke up...- My name is Hwang Ho-jin.

397
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:32,067
Any other symptomsbesides headaches?

398
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:46,515
Sometimes my ears ring.I'm cold. And I keep getting sleepy.

399
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:51,286
But doctor, I'm Hwang Ho-jin.

400
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:54,656
What happened to me?

401
00:43:54,656 --> 00:43:59,761
From a psychologist's perspective,his depression and hysteria

402
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:02,964
have sprung up in a peculiarway after his trauma.

403
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:05,434
On the surface,

404
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,036
he believes he's Hwang Ho-jin.

405
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:13,008
But the problem isthat his consciousness firmly

406
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:16,912
believes that he's possessed.

407
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:18,780
Possessed?

408
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:26,388
If I explain it simply, the body istaken over by someone else's spirit.

409
00:44:26,388 --> 00:44:32,360
The best way to know is to findproof of his believe fromhis unconscious.

410
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:47,976
Doctor. How can this be possible?

411
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,911
Oh my goodness.Oh my goodness.

412
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:51,379
Your hand.

413
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:55,050
Oh no.

414
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,352
Eun-soo, he cut his hand.

415
00:44:57,352 --> 00:44:58,954
He kept saying he's Ho-jin.

416
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:01,256
Wait.

417
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:05,060
My hands aren't listening to me.

418
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,795
I don't know how this happened.

419
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:08,830
Dae-jin, hurry and go inside first.

420
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,532
Yeah, let's hurry, Dae-jin.

421
00:45:10,532 --> 00:45:15,871
I'm not Dae-jin.

422
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:20,275
I don't know. I don't knowwhy I'm like this.

423
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:26,681
Hey. Pull yourself together.You're Hwang Dae-jin.

424
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:36,424
You're the Hwang Dae-jin.I've always liked!

425
00:45:36,424 --> 00:45:47,369
Eun-soo, I'm sorry.I'm really sorry.

426
00:45:47,369 --> 00:46:01,316
Yae-joo. Dae-jin is still sick.

427
00:46:01,316 --> 00:46:05,687
He's doing this becausehe's still mentally unstable.

428
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:09,925
When time passes, he'll be better.

429
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:17,732
That bastard. He's trying tosuck me dry forever.

430
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:30,412
I'll be backafter I give this to him.

431
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:44,226
The gift yourfather gave you.

432
00:46:44,226 --> 00:47:24,099
I've finally fixed it.

433
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:28,770
- Can you hear my voice?- Yes.

434
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,007
Tell me your name.

435
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:33,909
Hwang Ho-jin.

436
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:35,543
Good.

437
00:47:35,543 --> 00:47:40,916
You're falling into acalmer and deeper sleep.

438
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:44,386
Imagine a cloud.

439
00:47:44,386 --> 00:47:49,791
A soft wind is blowing.The cloud is moving slowly.

440
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:53,995
Very slowly.

441
00:47:53,995 --> 00:48:05,106
Now look slowlybelow the cloud.

442
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:10,178
What do you see?

443
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,047
A road.

444
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:20,488
What's on top of this road?

445
00:48:20,488 --> 00:48:23,625
A taxi. Taxi.

446
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:32,300
Are you riding in this taxi?

447
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,468
I don't know.

448
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:39,574
You're moving forward.Slowly.

449
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:49,851
What do you seein front of you?

450
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:58,093
What do you see?

451
00:48:58,093 --> 00:49:08,937
Calm down.Put your mind at ease.

452
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:11,940
Common symptomsfor possessed patients

453
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,844
are a drop in their temperatureand feeling very cold.

454
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:20,215
They keep sleeping,and even their ears ring.

455
00:49:20,215 --> 00:49:27,522
But doctor how couldmy husband's soul...

456
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:32,494
Even modern psychology can't provewhether possession exists or not.

457
00:49:32,494 --> 00:49:52,247
By simply acknowledging itand nursing him is better.

458
00:49:52,247 --> 00:50:04,559
Take your medicine.

459
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:12,000
How I'm acting now...I'm not sick, Eun-soo.

460
00:50:12,000 --> 00:52:10,685
I understand. But you have totake this medicine.

461
00:52:10,685 --> 00:52:13,521
Eun-soo.

462
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:20,061
Eun-soo, open the door.

463
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:23,631
Eun-soo, open the door.

464
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:29,070
I'm not going to do anything.

465
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:38,913
Eun-soo.

466
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:50,825
I'm sorry.I didn't want to do this.

467
00:52:50,825 --> 00:53:37,405
But being alone in that roomis too hard for me.

468
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:43,711
Don't go.

469
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:50,084
I'm scared, Eun-soo.

470
00:53:50,084 --> 00:54:00,762
If I sleep in that room alone,I feel like I'll never wake up.

471
00:54:00,762 --> 00:54:22,583
I'm very frightened.

472
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:32,093
Being with Dae-jinis too hard on me.

473
00:54:32,093 --> 00:54:42,637
I feel like I'm unconsciouslylooking for Ho-jin in him.

474
00:54:42,637 --> 00:54:56,217
No. Honestly, I saw him.

475
00:54:56,217 --> 00:55:01,823
I'm so confused.

476
00:55:01,823 --> 00:55:09,430
I feel like I know whatyou're going through.

477
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:16,070
Eun-soo. I finished my thesis,so I have a lot of time now.

478
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:23,811
If it's okay that I spend timewith him, he'll get better.

479
00:55:23,811 --> 00:55:26,881
When you were in the marines,

480
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,650
you said it was hell,but you felt peaceful.

481
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,387
If we work our butt offat my family's ranch,

482
00:55:32,387 --> 00:55:36,391
that mildew in your headwill wash away.

483
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:41,295
Yae-joo. Where can I go?

484
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:47,101
I'm not going anywhere.This is my place.

485
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:52,106
Eun-soo agreed with me.

486
00:55:52,106 --> 00:55:54,041
Eun-soo did?

487
00:55:54,041 --> 00:56:02,817
Yes, your sister-in-law.

488
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:07,588
If I just stay here like this,

489
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:12,360
everything will turn back to normal.

490
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,830
Hey, how long will you keep this up?

491
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,099
Are you planningto drive us crazy?

492
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:21,836
Eun-soo is having it hardenough taking care of Ho-jin.

493
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:32,213
Seeing him in a coma forover a year is hell enough.

494
00:56:32,213 --> 00:58:15,917
What did you just say?

495
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:21,756
Look. Look very carefully.

496
00:58:21,756 --> 00:58:37,104
That's Hwang Dae-jin's face.Know do you get it? Do you?

497
00:58:37,104 --> 00:58:48,182
If it's that hard on you,I'll become Dae-jin.

498
00:58:48,182 --> 00:59:11,472
I'll live like Dae-jin.

499
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:16,577
Scared, huh? Cutting grass,chasing and milking cows.

500
00:59:16,577 --> 00:59:19,480
You'll probably pass out.

501
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:39,166
But don't worry. I'll help you.

502
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:53,414
Ho-jin. It's Eun-soo.I see that my Ho-jin is still sleeping.

503
00:59:53,414 --> 01:00:03,324
I thought you hated being lazy.So how could yousleep this long?

504
01:00:03,324 --> 01:00:09,997
I've changed a lot lately.

505
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:17,672
I get angry with people a lot,and I don't laugh easily.

506
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:24,345
If you saw me,you'd be surprised.

507
01:00:24,345 --> 01:00:37,692
I can't remember your voice.

508
01:00:37,692 --> 01:00:47,435
The harder I try, the moreI can't remember.

509
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:56,577
I wish you'd call me just once.

510
01:00:56,577 --> 01:01:05,453
Eun-soo. Hey, Eun-soo.

511
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:40,721
Without you, I can't do anything.

512
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:44,525
Go!

513
01:01:44,525 --> 01:01:47,995
Hey. You're working upa real sweat.

514
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,365
Trying hard to make my family rich?

515
01:01:51,365 --> 01:01:52,900
Dae-jin.

516
01:01:52,900 --> 01:03:36,737
Leave me alone if you want tomake me into Dae-jin.

517
01:03:36,737 --> 01:03:46,947
Since you're not complainingand whining, you're no fun at all.

518
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:54,722
Fine. I guess I'll just bea one-woman band forever.

519
01:03:54,722 --> 01:04:04,164
I'll play drums with yousometimes. Bang, bang.

520
01:04:04,164 --> 01:04:12,640
Hey. Like you,

521
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,912
if I could become someone else,

522
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:27,688
then I wish I had never met you.

523
01:04:27,688 --> 01:04:38,666
Then I could've madeabout 100 guys like me.

524
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,434
Hey.

525
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:47,841
Look. When you do this,you're totally Dae-jin.

526
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:52,046
Now you laugh for me?

527
01:04:52,046 --> 01:05:52,439
I tried so hard to see it just once.

528
01:05:52,439 --> 01:05:58,612
Hey. I don't care who you are.

529
01:05:58,612 --> 01:06:00,814
You're simplysomeone who I love.

530
01:06:00,814 --> 01:08:56,590
Also, I'm going to hold onto that love. Until I die.

531
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:09,970
I'm sorry. I had no choicebut to come back.

532
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:14,641
For Eskimos,

533
01:09:14,641 --> 01:09:18,412
when someone they love dies,

534
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:22,449
they gather and talk aboutthat person for five days.

535
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:28,655
While they talk, they erase theirmemories of that person.

536
01:09:28,655 --> 01:09:34,995
Afterwards, they nevertalk about that person again.

537
01:09:34,995 --> 01:09:43,837
If they do, then that person's soulcan't rest in peace.

538
01:09:43,837 --> 01:09:45,939
Let's talk about Ho-jin.

539
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:51,044
About everything you and I know.

540
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,112
Eun-soo.

541
01:09:52,112 --> 01:09:57,150
And then never talkabout him again.

542
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,621
After you left to serve,

543
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:04,992
I begged Ho-jinto go over his place.

544
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,226
Stop it, Eun-soo.

545
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:13,267
It was about the end of June.It rained the whole day.

546
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:21,642
When I got there,his place was flooded in.

547
01:10:21,642 --> 01:10:30,550
While we poured water outall day, Ho-jin said,

548
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:39,960
Feels like the world has flooded,and we're the only two left.

549
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,196
To raise money for your tuition,

550
01:10:43,196 --> 01:10:47,134
did you know that he workedin a factory for two months?

551
01:10:47,134 --> 01:10:51,571
I was worriedso I went to him,

552
01:10:51,571 --> 01:10:56,476
and saw him limpingwhile carrying bricks.

553
01:10:56,476 --> 01:11:03,150
I wanted to take him out of there,but I couldn't.

554
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:08,655
I thought he'd be more upsetif he knew I came,

555
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:15,495
so I couldn't.

556
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:20,767
No one knows.No one can know.

557
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:23,770
How we met.

558
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:33,347
How we loved.No one knows.

559
01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:37,684
It was exactly on June 28th.

560
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:43,357
And it started rainingfrom the afternoon.

561
01:11:43,357 --> 01:11:48,495
While pouring out the water,you said,

562
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:55,035
I wish the world swept away,and we were the only two left.

563
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:59,639
I couldn't bare watching you,and told you to stop,

564
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:03,110
but you silentlyscooped the water.

565
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:11,818
A man can never leave a woman,who overcame an obstaclewith him.

566
01:12:11,818 --> 01:12:16,223
I worked at the factoryfor one and a half months.

567
01:12:16,223 --> 01:12:26,366
It was a Saturday.You suddenly...

568
01:12:26,366 --> 01:12:30,137
You came right before lunch.

569
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:37,010
After getting yelled at,I turned around,

570
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:46,520
and saw a girl with a yellowshirt walking away.

571
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,023
I also saw you that day.

572
01:12:50,023 --> 01:12:56,730
I wanted to call you,I wanted to grab you,

573
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:03,437
But I couldn't.

574
01:13:03,437 --> 01:13:10,977
Seeing me like that, I thoughtmake you upset.

575
01:13:10,977 --> 01:13:16,249
I knew how you'd feel,so I couldn't call you.

576
01:13:16,249 --> 01:13:18,885
Stop it.

577
01:13:18,885 --> 01:13:25,859
Eun-soo. Whenever you laughedor became upset,

578
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:29,162
I was always with you.

579
01:13:29,162 --> 01:13:33,667
So that's why

580
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:40,474
we're the same inside.You know better.

581
01:13:40,474 --> 01:13:52,419
Stop it. Stop.

582
01:13:52,419 --> 01:13:59,192
Look. Look at me, Eun-soo.

583
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:06,433
It's me. Can't you see?

584
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:12,772
I should've died then,but I couldn't.

585
01:14:12,772 --> 01:14:27,621
I should've died, and be gone forever,but I couldn't.

586
01:14:27,621 --> 01:14:39,499
Because of you. No one canlove you as much as me.

587
01:14:39,499 --> 01:15:28,615
That's why I returned.

588
01:15:28,615 --> 01:15:34,287
Remember this, right?

589
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:39,759
How could you not?

590
01:15:39,759 --> 01:15:49,736
All the memories thatare hidden in our home

591
01:15:49,736 --> 01:16:20,533
are proof that we'veloved each other until now.

592
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:34,414
Ho-jin.

593
01:16:34,414 --> 01:16:39,586
Ho-jin.

594
01:16:39,586 --> 01:16:47,861
Eun-soo.

595
01:16:47,861 --> 01:24:11,671
You're all that I have.

596
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,039
Let's buy bananas.

597
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:14,340
I don't want to.

598
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,108
Why?

599
01:24:15,108 --> 01:24:16,642
I don't like bananas.

600
01:24:16,642 --> 01:24:24,884
But it's for our baby.

601
01:24:24,884 --> 01:24:44,203
You're out of lotion, right?Should we buy it?

602
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:47,540
I brought your lunch.

603
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,908
Is it going well?

604
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:52,445
Yep.

605
01:24:52,445 --> 01:24:57,617
I'm going to have an exhibition.I feel a lot better now.

606
01:24:57,617 --> 01:24:59,986
That's great.Don't overwork yourself.

607
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:10,830
Okay.

608
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:12,265
What's wrong?

609
01:25:12,265 --> 01:25:16,602
Because you're pretty.

610
01:25:16,602 --> 01:25:21,541
Why do you keep laughing?

611
01:25:21,541 --> 01:25:28,848
Because you're pretty.

612
01:25:28,848 --> 01:25:32,118
It's good to see youa lot happier now.

613
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:37,256
Does it show? Yae-joo.

614
01:25:37,256 --> 01:25:46,199
I'm okay.Anyway, it feels strange.

615
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:50,570
I tried so hard to bring Dae-jin back,

616
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:58,578
but suddenly, I thought whatdifference would it make.

617
01:25:58,578 --> 01:26:04,083
Since Dae-jin thought of meonly as a friend.

618
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:10,189
I'm sorry, Yae-joo.I didn't want to...

619
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:18,030
But Yae-joo, he's really Ho-jin.

620
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:22,902
I always felt my fatherwas with me after he died.

621
01:26:22,902 --> 01:26:26,339
Even though I can't see him,

622
01:26:26,339 --> 01:26:32,144
it feels the same with Ho-jin.He's really Ho-jin.

623
01:26:32,144 --> 01:26:41,954
I know. That Dae-jin isn'tsomeone I can love.

624
01:26:41,954 --> 01:26:46,592
He's someone else now.

625
01:26:46,592 --> 01:26:57,236
And it's not like we canshare the same person.

626
01:26:57,236 --> 01:27:03,342
It's a complicated fate.

627
01:27:03,342 --> 01:27:14,387
But I'm glad to see Dae-jinhappy before I leave.

628
01:27:14,387 --> 01:27:22,261
You two have to live happily.Mine and Dae-jin's worth.

629
01:27:22,261 --> 01:27:58,798
I'll go say bye to Dae-jin...I mean Ho-jin before I leave.

630
01:27:58,798 --> 01:28:01,367
Had it hardbecause of me, huh?

631
01:28:01,367 --> 01:28:09,975
Because of who?Dae-jin or Ho-jin?

632
01:28:09,975 --> 01:28:13,312
So you're studying abroad?

633
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,914
Yeah.

634
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:17,983
When will you come back?

635
01:28:17,983 --> 01:28:28,494
If I do? Will you becomeDae-jin then?

636
01:28:28,494 --> 01:28:37,770
Can I think of you asDae-jin and say something?

637
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:48,414
You're a rotten bastard.

638
01:28:48,414 --> 01:29:02,161
Have a good life.

639
01:29:02,161 --> 01:29:34,894
Hey. Whether you're Dae-jinor Ho-jin, give me a hug.

640
01:29:34,894 --> 01:29:38,664
You really must not be Dae-jin.

641
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:48,874
Dae-jin never gave mea warm hug like this before.

642
01:29:48,874 --> 01:29:57,917
One sec.

643
01:29:57,917 --> 01:30:04,223
Hello? Oh, hi.Yes, it's Hwang Ho-jin.

644
01:30:04,223 --> 01:30:07,560
You remembered.

645
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:13,566
Yes... So I'll be readyfor the exhibition

646
01:30:13,566 --> 01:30:16,836
in about a week I think.

647
01:30:16,836 --> 01:30:22,741
I'd like about two daysin advance to set it up.

648
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:25,811
Yes.

649
01:30:25,811 --> 01:30:34,920
I see. Wouldn't just one bannerout in front be good enough?

650
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,156
Yes.

651
01:30:37,156 --> 01:30:41,494
And for the openingand closing ceremonies,

652
01:30:41,494 --> 01:30:44,930
I'd like a sufficient.

653
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:48,968
It's because of traffic,

654
01:30:48,968 --> 01:30:55,975
and I'd like to focus a loton the opening party.

655
01:30:55,975 --> 01:31:11,724
Yes. Thank you.Bye.

656
01:31:11,724 --> 01:31:17,530
To be honest, he's been braindead for too long.

657
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:24,036
And some of his body partsare rotten.

658
01:31:24,036 --> 01:31:26,705
I'm sorry to tell you this,

659
01:31:26,705 --> 01:31:29,308
but for the patient's sake,

660
01:31:29,308 --> 01:32:11,650
I think it's goodto send him away.

661
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:16,155
The latest test resultsshow a lost of corneal reflexes.

662
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:21,360
Reflexes in the spinal cordhave been lost.

663
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:26,231
Even after the latest test,the patient's brain waves

664
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:28,968
were flat for 30 minutes.

665
01:32:28,968 --> 01:33:23,055
With the test results as proof,we confirm Hwang Ho-jinas brain dead.

666
01:33:23,055 --> 01:34:37,429
Hwang Ho-jin is now deceased.

667
01:34:37,429 --> 01:34:39,164
Yes, I'll see you in a bit.

668
01:34:39,164 --> 01:34:40,265
Okay.

669
01:34:40,265 --> 01:34:43,302
- Please look around.- Thank you.

670
01:34:43,302 --> 01:34:47,473
Ho-jin, I'll go homeand come back tonight.

671
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:50,175
Why? Not feeling well?Your face looks bad.

672
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:52,511
I just feel a bit dizzy.

673
01:34:52,511 --> 01:35:01,019
Go get some rest then.

674
01:35:01,019 --> 01:35:03,422
Eun-soo.

675
01:35:03,422 --> 01:35:05,791
Why'd you come out?

676
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:09,061
I wanted to see you leave.Can you drive?

677
01:35:09,061 --> 01:35:11,330
Of course.

678
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:16,034
Come here. I don't want youto leave.

679
01:35:16,034 --> 01:35:29,982
I'll go rest a littleand come back.

680
01:35:29,982 --> 01:35:33,786
When you go home...

681
01:35:33,786 --> 01:35:36,455
call me.

682
01:35:36,455 --> 01:35:37,389
Okay.

683
01:35:37,389 --> 01:35:38,524
Boy, he scared me.

684
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:42,795
Go back in.

685
01:35:42,795 --> 01:35:59,444
Go.

686
01:35:59,444 --> 01:36:00,679
Who is it?

687
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:04,650
I have a package for you.

688
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:11,623
A package for you.Please sign here.

689
01:36:11,623 --> 01:36:49,261
Thank you.

690
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:53,699
I thought you might needthe original so I'm returning it.

691
01:36:53,699 --> 01:36:56,501
Even when I'm lying deadin my coffin,

692
01:36:56,501 --> 01:37:00,138
I still won't be able tounderstand your sick love.

693
01:37:00,138 --> 01:37:07,045
Before then, I hope I forget you.

694
01:37:07,045 --> 01:37:12,117
Wouldn't just one bannerout in front be good enough?

695
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,519
Yes.

696
01:37:14,519 --> 01:37:19,658
And for the openingand closing ceremonies,

697
01:37:19,658 --> 01:37:21,927
I'd like a sufficientamount of time.

698
01:37:21,927 --> 01:37:25,831
It's because of traffic,

699
01:37:25,831 --> 01:37:34,439
and I'd like to focus a loton the opening party.

700
01:37:34,439 --> 01:38:03,869
Yes. Thank you.Bye.

701
01:38:03,869 --> 01:38:10,175
Like what Marcel Duchampintended to do with the toilet,

702
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:15,547
I wanted to make thingscommon to us closer to real life.

703
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:53,618
So there are a lot of images,like flowers and butterflies.

704
01:38:53,618 --> 01:39:14,573
Eun-soo's Dandelions

705
01:39:14,573 --> 01:39:20,212
I saw a girl today.

706
01:39:20,212 --> 01:39:24,483
She was like the sunshineof September.

707
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:26,785
The moment I caught

708
01:39:26,785 --> 01:39:36,028
all the sadnesswithin me disappeared.

709
01:39:36,028 --> 01:39:41,099
I don't know how to explainthis strong feeling.

710
01:39:41,099 --> 01:39:43,668
What are you so nervous about?

711
01:39:43,668 --> 01:39:46,304
No, I'm not.

712
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:50,609
For someone who'sclueless about women,

713
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:58,583
I'm very curiousas to who she is.

714
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:02,788
I met my brother's woman.

715
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:05,557
- Sorry I'm late.- It's okay.

716
01:40:05,557 --> 01:40:06,958
Dae-jin, right?

717
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:09,528
Dae-jin say hello toHan Eun-soo.

718
01:40:09,528 --> 01:40:11,630
- The world...- Hi.

719
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:14,599
abandoned me.

720
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:17,936
Even the skies.

721
01:40:17,936 --> 01:40:23,208
Today is the happiest dayof my brother's life.

722
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:30,115
After today,his life will be even happier.

723
01:40:30,115 --> 01:40:39,791
Since Eun-soo will be with him.I'm also a happy person.

724
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:46,331
I'll be able to see Eun-soo forever.

725
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:54,439
From behind.

726
01:40:54,439 --> 01:41:01,947
Ho-jin told me everythingabout his times with Eun-soo.

727
01:41:01,947 --> 01:41:05,417
Ho-jin doesn't know women.

728
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:10,522
So I told him howto write love letters.

729
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:15,827
And through his letters,Eun-soo became happier.

730
01:41:15,827 --> 01:41:21,733
Ho-jin said he's luckyto have a brother like me.

731
01:41:21,733 --> 01:41:28,874
I'm a luckier guy.

732
01:41:28,874 --> 01:42:14,319
Seeing that I haven't gone insane yet,living under the same roof with them.

733
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:18,190
To give a pureand fairy-tail like feeling,

734
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:23,461
and to make it pleasurable,was my intention.

735
01:42:23,461 --> 01:42:26,364
Furniture is something that

736
01:42:26,364 --> 01:42:29,201
people are very familiar with.

737
01:42:29,201 --> 01:43:43,441
But they easily forgetits actual existence.

738
01:43:43,441 --> 01:43:49,648
Dae-jin, don't you wanta girlfriend?

739
01:43:49,648 --> 01:43:53,218
The best times are at your age.

740
01:43:53,218 --> 01:43:54,886
I like it now.

741
01:43:54,886 --> 01:43:57,289
Like what?

742
01:43:57,289 --> 01:44:02,994
Fiddling with thatcar of yours in the garage?

743
01:44:02,994 --> 01:44:12,337
Of course. Just with thatI'm happy enough.

744
01:44:12,337 --> 01:44:19,811
Sometimes I want to justthrow it all away, but I can't.

745
01:44:19,811 --> 01:44:24,916
I can't think of anything else,and I don't want to.

746
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:30,655
I think I'll belike this until I die.

747
01:44:30,655 --> 01:44:33,625
Since it's next to me,

748
01:44:33,625 --> 01:45:44,396
I like it. I can always see it,and feel it. I like this a lot.

749
01:45:44,396 --> 01:45:50,034
You're here.

750
01:45:50,034 --> 01:45:57,342
Did everything go well?

751
01:45:57,342 --> 01:46:09,187
So are you okay now?

752
01:46:09,187 --> 01:46:18,930
This piece. To make this,you stayed up for three days, huh?

753
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:22,333
Are you really okay?

754
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:26,204
Yes.

755
01:46:26,204 --> 01:46:29,374
This is the door to heaven.

756
01:46:29,374 --> 01:46:32,410
If I were to explain it,

757
01:46:32,410 --> 01:46:35,513
I made it thinking that deathisn't a scary thing after all.

758
01:46:35,513 --> 01:46:38,349
Think it gives offa pretty and warm feeling?

759
01:46:38,349 --> 01:46:42,587
Yeah.

760
01:46:42,587 --> 01:46:44,989
And this?

761
01:46:44,989 --> 01:46:47,559
This is Alice in Wonderland.

762
01:46:47,559 --> 01:46:49,327
I made it to be fun and cute,

763
01:46:49,327 --> 01:46:56,901
while thinking of our baby.There's a mirror inside, too.

764
01:46:56,901 --> 01:47:01,806
That'll look betterat our doorway.

765
01:47:01,806 --> 01:47:05,443
Sounds good.Since it's blue, it'll feel fresh.

766
01:47:05,443 --> 01:47:08,246
And we can put the CDs on it.

767
01:47:08,246 --> 01:47:11,649
You haven't seen this, huh?

768
01:47:11,649 --> 01:47:13,985
Yes.

769
01:47:13,985 --> 01:47:17,989
Oh yeah, you saw thiswhile I was working on it.

770
01:47:17,989 --> 01:47:52,590
I saw.

771
01:47:52,590 --> 01:48:04,936
My brother...My kind brother...

772
01:48:04,936 --> 01:48:12,944
You lived while sacrificingyour life for me.

773
01:48:12,944 --> 01:48:21,319
But did you know this?That I loved Eun-soo first?

774
01:48:21,319 --> 01:48:27,058
I loved her enoughto abandon myself.

775
01:48:27,058 --> 01:48:31,596
But Eun-soo never knew.

776
01:48:31,596 --> 01:48:38,469
All she thought of was you.

777
01:48:38,469 --> 01:48:47,478
Yes, my brother.I'm not in this world anymore.

778
01:48:47,478 --> 01:48:52,750
I'm the one who really died.

779
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:58,590
I'm going to become youand love Eun-soo now.

780
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:04,729
Eun-soo will think of youwhen she's with me,

781
01:49:04,729 --> 01:49:15,640
while loving only you.

782
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:23,281
Ho-jin.

783
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:29,621
Ho-jin.

784
01:49:29,621 --> 01:49:36,027
You can never forgive me, right?

785
01:49:36,027 --> 01:49:43,034
Don't forgive me.Never.

786
01:49:43,034 --> 01:49:49,641
Don't ever forgive me.

787
01:49:49,641 --> 99:59:59,999
Ho-jin, I'm sorry.

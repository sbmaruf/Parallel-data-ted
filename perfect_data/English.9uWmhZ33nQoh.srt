1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,360
Space - there's only so much.
And when you run out... That's it.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:18,280
Or is it?

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,720
What if you could do
more with the space you have?

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,400
What if there was
a smarter way to use space?

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,920
There is.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,200
Let's imagine a room everyone uses.
24 hours a day. It's a living room.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,880
It's a playroom.
We'd better make it easy to clean up.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:58,840
And if we use this space up here,
it can also be a bedroom. Smart.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,680
Stackable stools, drawers
on wheels, a bed up in the air.

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,720
Small ideas can transform a small
space into a generous space-

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,520
-that works for everyone.

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,280
It's about maximising space - being
a little creative with how you use it.

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,680
So, what if we get a little
creative with a space like this.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Does a living room really need a sofa?
What if we tried something different?

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,320
There, we just created
a whole wall for storage.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,520
And a cosy little nest for two.
Now everyone can do what they want.

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,360
At the same time.
Together.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,160
And being together
is a good thing, right?

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,840
So, let's try something
completely different.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,200
Here are six friends.
And this is where they live. Together.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Why not? With bunk beds,
curtains for privacy-

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,800
-and a big communal table
to gather around.

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:14,400
It can work.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,360
To make the most of the space you've
got all you need is an open mind.

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,800
And a few smart, small ideas.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
It's about finding
and using hidden spaces-

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,120
-and choosing furniture
that does more than one thing.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,560
And it works. No matter how
much or how little space you have.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
It's not about giving up your dreams.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:43,360
It's about shrinking them,
just a little bit.

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,480
It's about making space do more.

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,880
Even more than you could imagine.

33
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,720
And it's not about waiting.
It's about doing it today.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,920
A dream home doesn't need to be big...
Just smart.

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,440
And it's kind of funny
when you think about it.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
The space you've
been looking for-

37
00:03:09,320 --> 99:59:59,000
-it's been right there. All along.

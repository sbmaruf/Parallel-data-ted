1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490


2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:07,760
We need to divide 0.25
into 1.03075.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,260
Now the first thing you want to
do when your divisor, the

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,690
number that you're dividing into
the other number, is a

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,850
decimal, is to multiply it by
10 enough times so that it

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,990
becomes a whole number
so you can shift the

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,220
decimal to the right.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,620
So every time you multiply
something by 10, you're

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,170
shifting the decimal over
to the right once.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,620
So in this case, we want
to switch it over the

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,310
right once and twice.

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,690
So 0.25 times 10 twice is the
same thing as 0.25 times 100,

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,190
and we'll turn the
0.25 into 25.

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,250
Now if you do that with the
divisor, you also have to do

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,860
that with the dividend,
the number that

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,920
you're dividing into.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,220
So we also have to multiply this
by 10 twice, or another

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,190
way of doing it is shift
the decimal over

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,560
to the right twice.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,680
So we shift it over
once, twice.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,440
It will sit right over here.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,180
And to see why that makes
sense, you just have to

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,700
realize that this expression
right here, this division

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:14,840
problem, is the exact same
thing as having 1.03075

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,310
divided by 0.25.

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,650
And so we're multiplying
the 0.25 by 10 twice.

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,590
We're essentially multiplying
it by 100.

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,960
Let me do that in a
different color.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,750
We're multiplying it by 100
in the denominator.

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,760
This is the divisor.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,670
We're multiplying it by 100, so
we also have to do the same

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,040
thing to the numerator, if we
don't want to change this

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
expression, if we don't want
to change the number.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,400
So we also have to multiply
that by 100.

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,050
And when you do that,
this becomes 25, and

36
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,200
this becomes 103.075.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,400
Now let me just rewrite this.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,520
Sometimes if you're doing this
in a workbook or something,

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,240
you don't have to rewrite it as
long as you remember where

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,910
the decimal is.

41
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,340
But I'm going to rewrite
it, just so it's

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,480
a little bit neater.

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,330
So we multiplied both
the divisor and

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,040
the dividend by 100.

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:17,590
This problem becomes 25
divided into 103.075.

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,130
These are going to result in
the exact same quotient.

47
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,160
They're the exact same fraction,
if you want to view

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,580
it that way.

49
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,430
We've just multiplied both the
numerator and the denominator

50
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,720
by 100 to shift the decimal
over to the right twice.

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Now that we've done that,
we're ready to divide.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,520
So the first thing, we have 25
here, and there's always a

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,160
little bit of an art to dividing
something by a

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,660
multiple-digit number, so we'll
see how well we can do.

55
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,810
So 25 does not go into 1.

56
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,750
25 does not go into 10.

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,410
25 does go into 103.

58
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,400
We know that 4 times 25
is 100, so 25 goes

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,880
into 100 four times.

60
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,540
4 times 5 is 20.

61
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,840
4 times 2 is 8, plus 2 is 100.

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,990
We knew that.

63
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,600
Four quarters is $1.00.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,130
It's 100 cents.

65
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,590
And now we subtract.

66
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,920
103 minus 100 is going to
be 3, and now we can

67
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,100
bring down this 0.

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,640
So we bring down that 0 there.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,710
25 goes into 30 one time.

70
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,210
And if we want, we could
immediately put

71
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,070
this decimal here.

72
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,400
We don't have to wait until
the end of the problem.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,930
This decimal sits right in that
place, so we could always

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,730
have that decimal sitting right
there in our quotient or

75
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,980
in our answer.

76
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,010


77
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,690
So we were at 25 goes
into 30 one time.

78
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,970
1 times 25 is 25, and then
we can subtract.

79
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,550
30 minus 25, well,
that's just 5.

80
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,510
I mean, we can do all this
borrowing business, or

81
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,140
regrouping.

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,410
This can become a 10.

83
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,570
This becomes a 2.

84
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,350
10 minus 5 is 5.

85
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,200
2 minus 2 is nothing.

86
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,250
But anyway, 30 minus 25 is 5.

87
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,860
Now we can bring down this 7.

88
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,270
25 goes into 57 two
times, right?

89
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,780
25 times 2 is 50.

90
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,940
25 goes into 57 two times.

91
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,130
2 times 25 is 50.

92
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,940
And now we subtract again.

93
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,950
57 minus 50 is 7.

94
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,760
And now we're almost done.

95
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,360


96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,280
We bring down that 5
right over there.

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,150
25 goes into 75 three times.

98
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,610
3 times 25 is 75.

99
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,390
3 times 5 is 15.

100
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,240
Regroup the 1.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,980
We can ignore that.

102
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,920
That was from before.

103
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,960
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,260
So you can see that.

105
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,540
And then we subtract, and then
we have no remainder.

106
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,110
So 25 goes into 103.075 exactly
4.123 times, which

107
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,100
makes sense, because 25 goes
into 100 about four times.

108
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,080
This is a little bit larger than
100, so it's going to be

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,740
a little bit more
than four times.

110
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,920
And that's going to be the
exact same answer as the

111
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:16,600
number of times that 0.25
goes into 1.03075.

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,520
This will also be 4.123.

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,580
So this fraction, or this
expression, is the exact same

114
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,730
thing as 4.123.

115
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,340
And we're done!

116
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,399

1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,990
Consider the numbers one third, seven, and negative fifteen.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,600
To which sets of numbers, listed below does each of these numbers belong?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,754
So let's think about the sets first and then that'll make it pretty straightforward to think about what sets these guys are members of.

4
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:21,267
So natural numbers - you can kind of view these as the counting numbers.

5
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:23,600
This is one, two, three, four, five, six.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,867
Or another way to think about it - it's the whole numbers except for zero.

7
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,200
So zero is not in the natural numbers.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,733
It starts at one. One, two, three, four, so on and so forth.

9
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:38,600
Whole numbers, is the natural numbers, plus zero - plus zero.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Integers are the whole numbers plus the negative versions of the natural numbers.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Then rational numbers - these are any number that can be represented by a fraction.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Irrational numbers cannot be represented by a fraction.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,600
And then real numbers are essentially all of these.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Let's think about the numbers that they gave us.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,267
So let's first think about one third.

16
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:04,800
One third is not a counting number. It's not a whole number - it's a fraction.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,333
It's not an integer (it's a fraction.)

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,467
It is a rational number - it can clearly be represented as a fraction.

19
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,467
So I'll write it over here.

20
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,733
One third is a rational number.

21
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,467
It's not an irrational number.

22
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:18,733
There's nothing that's part of both the rational and irrational.

23
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:20,467
You have to pick between one of those two.

24
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,867
But it's clearly a real number.

25
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:26,200
So one third is rational and it is real.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,533
So let's do seven here.

27
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,600
So seven is a natural number.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,533
When you count things, you can count up to seven.

29
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:39,200
it's definately a whole number. In fact anything that's a natural number is also going to be a whole number.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,400
And anything that's a natural number or a whole number is also going to be an integer.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,867
Anything that is a natural number, a whole number or integer is also going to be a rational number.

32
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:55,133
Cuz you can represent this as seven over one.

33
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,200
Seven is equal to seven over one.

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,933
And you can do this with any integer.

35
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,600
You can just say it's the same thing as that over one.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,867
So you can represent it as a fraction.

37
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,800
So it's clearly not irrational.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,271
But it's going to be real. It's going to be real.

39
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,533
And then finally you might be saying "Hey, why do we even care about real numbers?"

40
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,933
In the future we'll be introduced to things called imaginary and complex numbers.

41
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,067
And those aren't real.

42
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:24,467
But most of the numbers that you've dealt with so far, they're going to be real numbers.

43
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,733
So let's just finish up with negative fifteen over here.

44
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:33,133
Negative fifteen is not a counting number, it's not a natural number - it's not one two three and so on and so forth.

45
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:37,400
It's not a whole number, because that would just be zero plus one two three four five.

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,933
It is an integer though.

47
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:43,800
It is an integer - so it is negative fifteen is right over here.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You can view natural numbers as all positive integers.

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,733
You can view whole numbers as all non negative integers.

50
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:55,800
And of course integers will include negative and nonnegative integers.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,467
And that's where negative fifteen's going to sit.

52
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:01,133
Negative fifteen can be represented as a rational number.

53
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,867
It can be negative fifteen over one.

54
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,133
So we're going to put negative fifteen over here.

55
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:11,600
If it's rational it can't be irrational, and it's gonna be a real number.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 99:59:59,000
And we are done.

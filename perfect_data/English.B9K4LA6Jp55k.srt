1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This story

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is about taking imagination seriously.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Fourteen years ago,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
used the same way for centuries.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, I'm using it to create

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the scale of hard-edged buildings

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in cities around the world.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I never studied sculpture,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
engineering or architecture.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In fact, after college

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I applied to seven art schools

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and was rejected by all seven.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I went off on my own to become an artist,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and I painted for 10 years,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
when I was offered a Fulbright to India.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The deadline for the show arrived --

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
my paints didn't.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I had to do something.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I tried bronze casting.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I went for a walk on the beach,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
watching the fishermen

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'd seen it every day,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but this time I saw it differently --

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
a new approach to sculpture,

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
a way to make volumetric form

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
without heavy solid materials.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My first satisfying sculpture

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
was made in collaboration with these fishermen.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a self-portrait

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
titled "Wide Hips."

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(Laughter)

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We hoisted them on poles to photograph.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I discovered

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
their soft surfaces

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
revealed every ripple of wind

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
in constantly changing patterns.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was mesmerized.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I continued studying craft traditions

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and collaborating with artisans,

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
next in Lithuania with lace makers.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I liked the fine detail

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
it gave my work,

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but I wanted to make them larger --

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to shift from being an object you look at

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to something you could get lost in.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Returning to India to work with those fishermen,

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we made a net

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
of a million and a half hand-tied knots --

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
installed briefly in Madrid.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thousands of people saw it,

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and one of them was the urbanist

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Manual Sola-Morales

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
who was redesigning the waterfront

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in Porto, Portugal.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He asked if I could build this

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
as a permanent piece for the city.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I didn't know if I could do that

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and preserve my art.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Durable, engineered, permanent --

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
those are in opposition

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
For two years, I searched for a fiber

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that could survive ultraviolet rays,

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
salt, air, pollution,

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and at the same time remain soft enough

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to move fluidly in the wind.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We needed something to hold the net up

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
out there in the middle of the traffic circle.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We had to engineer it

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to move gracefully in an average breeze

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and survive in hurricane winds.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But there was no engineering software

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
to model something porous and moving.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
named Peter Heppel.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He helped me tackle the twin challenges

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
of precise shape

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and gentle movement.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I couldn't build this the way I knew

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
because hand-tied knots

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
weren't going to withstand a hurricane.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I developed a relationship

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
with an industrial fishnet factory,

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
learned the variables of their machines,

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and figured out a way

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to make lace with them.

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There was no language

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
into something machine operators could produce.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So we had to create one.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Three years and two children later,

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was hard to believe

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that what I had imagined

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
was now built, permanent

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and had lost nothing in translation.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
(Applause)

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now it had a sense of place.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I walked underneath it

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
for the first time.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I felt sheltered

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and, at the same time,

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
connected to limitless sky.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
My life was not going to be the same.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I want to create these oases of sculpture

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
in spaces of cities around the world.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to share two directions

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that are new in my work.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Historic Philadelphia City Hall:

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that was lighter than netting.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So we experimented

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
with tiny atomized water particles

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to create a dry mist

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that is shaped by the wind

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and in testing, discovered

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that it can be shaped by people

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
who can interact and move through it without getting wet.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm using this sculpture material

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to trace the paths of subway trains above ground

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
in real time --

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Next challenge,

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the Biennial of the Americas in Denver

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
asked, could I represent

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
in a sculpture?

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
(Laughter)

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I didn't know where to begin,

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
but I said yes.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and the tsunami that rippled across

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the entire Pacific Ocean.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
sped up the planet's rotation

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and literally shortened the length of the day.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I contacted NOAA,

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and translated it into this.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Its title: "1.26"

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
refers to the number of microseconds

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that the Earth's day was shortened.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Its shape was too complex now.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So I replaced the metal armature

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
with a soft, fine mesh

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The sculpture could now be entirely soft,

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
which made it so light

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it could tie in to existing buildings --

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There was no software

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that could extrude these complex net forms

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and model them with gravity.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So we had to create it.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then I got a call from New York City

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
asking if I could adapt these concepts

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to Times Square

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or the High Line.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This new soft structural method

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
enables me to model these

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and build these sculptures

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
at the scale of skyscrapers.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They don't have funding yet,

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but I dream now

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
of bringing these to cities around the world

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
where they're most needed.

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fourteen years ago,

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I searched for beauty

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in the traditional things,

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in craft forms.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to create voluptuous, billowing forms

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
the scale of buildings.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My artistic horizons continue to grow.

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll leave you with this story.

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
An attorney in the office

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
who'd never been interested in art,

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
never visited the local art museum,

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
dragged everyone she could from the building

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There they were in their business suits,

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
laying in the grass,

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
noticing the changing patterns of wind

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
beside people they didn't know,

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
sharing the rediscovery of wonder.

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
(Applause)

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you. Thank you.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you.

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you. Thank you.

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
(Applause)

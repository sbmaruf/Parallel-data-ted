1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,750
The speed of light is 3
times 10 to the eighth meters

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,600
per second.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,510
So as you can tell,
light is very fast,

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,150
3 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,100
If it takes 5 times 10 to the
second power seconds for light

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,740
to travel from the
sun to the earth--

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,380
let's think about
that a little bit.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,630
5 times 10 to the second,
that's 500 seconds.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,510
You have 60 seconds in
a minute, so 8 minutes

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,720
would be 480 seconds.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,310
So 500 seconds would be
about 8 minutes, 20 seconds.

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,230
It takes 8 minutes,
20 seconds for light

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,100
to travel from the
sun to the earth.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,070
What is the distance, in meters,
between the sun and the earth?

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,880
They're giving us a rate.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,470
They're giving us a speed.

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,880
They're giving us a time.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,070
And they want to
find a distance.

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,050
This goes straight back
to the standard distance

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,760
is equal to rate times time.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,800
So they give us the rate.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,269
The rate is 3 times 10 to
the eighth meters per second.

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:10,050

25
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,840
That right there is the rate.

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,780
They give us the time.

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,305
The time is 5 times 10
to the second seconds.

28
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:24,740

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,770
I'll just use that with a S.

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,750
How many meters?

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,090
So what is the distance?

32
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,790

33
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,320
And so we can just move these
around from the commutative

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,692
and the associative
properties of multiplication.

35
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,400
And actually, you can
multiply the units.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,025
That's called
dimensional analysis.

37
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,150
When you multiply the units,
you kind of treat them

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,110
like variables.

39
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,447
You should get the right
dimensions for distance.

40
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,030
So let's just rearrange
these numbers.

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,510
This is equal to 3
times 5-- I'm just

42
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,665
commuting and reassociating
these numbers and this product,

43
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:04,640
because we're just multiplying
everything-- 3 times 5 times

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,439
10 to the eighth times
10 to the second.

45
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,250

46
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,690
And then we're going to
have meters per second times

47
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,794
seconds.

48
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:23,460
And if you treated
these like variables,

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,990
these seconds would cancel out
with that seconds right there,

50
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,100
and you would just be left with
the unit meters, which is good,

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,882
because we want a
distance in just meters.

52
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:34,840
How does this simplify?

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,560
This gives us 3 times 5 is 15.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,520
15 times 10 to the
eighth times 10 squared.

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,450
We have the same base.

56
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,450
We're taking the product,
so we can add the exponents.

57
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,840
This is going to be 10 to
the 8 plus 2 power, or 10

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
to the 10th power.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,270
Now you might be tempted
to say that we're done,

60
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,150
that we have this in
scientific notation.

61
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,590
But remember, in
scientific notation

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,570
this number here has
to be greater than

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,010
or equal to 1 and less than 10.

64
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,590
This clearly is
not less than 10.

65
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,090
So how do we rewrite this?

66
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,350
We can write 15 as 1.5.

67
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,900
This clearly is greater
than 1 and less than 10.

68
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,430
And to get from 1.5 to 15,
you have to multiply by 10.

69
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,610
One way to think about
it is 15 is 15.0,

70
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,955
and so you have a decimal here.

71
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:33,100

72
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,870
If we're moving the decimal
one to the left to make it 1.5,

73
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,090
that's essentially
dividing by 10.

74
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,805
Moving the decimal to the left
means you're dividing by 10.

75
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,930
If we don't want to change
the value of the number,

76
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,530
we need to divide by 10
and then multiply by 10.

77
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,220
So this and that
are the same number.

78
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,960
Now 15 is 1.5 times
10, and then we

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:01,640
have to multiply that
times 10 to the 10th power,

80
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,820
this right over here.

81
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,400
10 is really just 10
to the first power.

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,790
So we can just
add the exponents.

83
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,620
Same base, taking the product.

84
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,350
This is equal to 1.5 times
10 to the 1 plus 10 power,

85
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,990
or 10 to the 11th power.

86
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,980
And we are done.

87
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,089
This is a huge distance.

88
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,394

89
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:24,560
It's very hard to visualize.

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,010
But anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.

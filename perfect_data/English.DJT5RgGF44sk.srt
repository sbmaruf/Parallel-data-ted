1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,225
Solve the system of linear
equations by graphing,

3
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:05,130
and they give us
two equations here.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,210
5x plus 3y is equal to 7, and
3x minus 2y is equal to 8.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,460
When they say, "Solve the
system of linear equations,"

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,380
they're really just
saying find an x

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,615
and a y that satisfies
both of these equations.

8
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,600
And when they say to
do it by graphing,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,830
we're essentially going to
graph this first equation.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,010
Remember, the graph is
really just depicting

11
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,929
all of the x's and y's that
satisfy this first equation,

12
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,470
and then we graph
the second equation

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,700
that's depicting all of the x's
and y's that satisfy that one.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,200
So if we were looking for an
x and a y that satisfies both,

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,740
that point needs to
be on both equations

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,760
or it has to be on both graphs.

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,170
So it'll be the intersection
of the two graphs.

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,170
So let's try to see
if we can do that.

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,360
So let's focus on
this first equation,

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,400
and I want to graph it.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,086
So I have 5x plus
3y is equal to 7.

22
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:58,960
There's a couple of ways
we could graph this.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,820
We could put this in
slope-intercept form,

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,480
or we could just pick
some points here.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,920
You just really need two
points to graph a line.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,390
So let me just set
some points over here.

27
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,710
Let's say x and y.

28
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,210
When x is equal to 0, what
does y need to be equal to?

29
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,950
So when x is equal
to 0, we have--

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,990
let me do it over here-- we
have 5 times 0, plus 3 times y,

31
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,130
is equal to 7.

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,710
That's just 0 over there.

33
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,800
So you have 3y is equal to 7.

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,950
Divide both sides
by 3, you get y

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:40,310
is equal to 7/3, which is
the same thing as 2 and 1/3

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,500
if we want to write
it as a mixed number.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,100
Now let's set y equal to 0.

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:52,270
So if we set y as equal to
0, we get 5x, plus 3 times 0,

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,560
is equal to 7.

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,950
Or in this part right over
here, it just becomes 0.

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,410
So we have 5x is equal to 7.

42
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,360
Divide both sides
by 5, and we get

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:13,280
x equals 7/5, which is the
same thing as 1 and 2/5.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,780
So let's graph both
of these points,

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,600
and then we should be able to
graph this line, or at least

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,690
a pretty good
approximation of that line.

47
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,520
So we have the
point, 0, 2 and 1/3.

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,250

49
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,460
So that's that point
right over there.

50
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,380
So I'll call it 0,
7/3 right over there,

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,520
and then we have the point,
7/5, 0, or 1 and 2/5, 0.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,290
So 1 and 2/5.

53
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,260
2/5 is a little
less than a half.

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,420
So 1 and 2/5, 0.

55
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,270
So our line is going to
look something like this.

56
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,050
I just have to connect the dots.

57
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,860
It's always hard to
draw the straight line.

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,130
I'll draw it as a dotted line.

59
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,850
So it would look
something like this.

60
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,380
Normally, when you have to
solve a system of equations

61
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,720
by graphing, they normally
give you a little bit cleaner

62
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,690
numbers, but we'll
try our best and see

63
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,250
if we can see where these
two lines intersect.

64
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,890
So now, let's worry about the
second one right over there.

65
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,000
So we have 3x minus
2y is equal to 8.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,250
So I'll do the same thing.

67
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,860
So 3x minus 2y is equal to 8.

68
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,320
We'll just look at the
x- and the y-intercepts.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,440
So first, the y-intercept.

70
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,250
When x is equal to 0, this whole
thing boils down to 3 times

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,520
0 minus 2y is equal to 8.

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,690
That's just 0.

73
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,580
So you have negative
2y is equal to 8.

74
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,190
Divide both sides
by negative 2, we

75
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,900
get y is equal to negative 4.

76
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,430

77
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,930
So the y-intercept
is 0, negative 4.

78
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,520
Right over here, and we
mark it 0, negative 4.

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,920
And then, let's
set y equal to 0.

80
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,960
So when y is equal to 0,
this term right over here

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,770
just becomes 0.

82
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,410
So we get 3x minus 2
times 0, so that's just 0.

83
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,470
So 3x is equal to 8.

84
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,575
Divide both sides by 3,
you get x is equal to 8/3.

85
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:22,270

86
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,240
And 8/3 is the same
thing as 2 and 2/3.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,770

88
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,080
So it puts it right about there.

89
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,410
That's the point, 0, 8/3.

90
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,520
Now let me try my
best to graph it.

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,580
Connect these two dots.

92
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,656
So let me do my very best.

93
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,790
I drew a dotted line there.

94
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,580
It goes something like that.

95
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,650
And just eyeballing it, it looks
like these two lines intersect

96
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,910
right over there.

97
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,300
I'm hoping that this will
give us a clean answer.

98
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,790
And this is the
point 2, negative 1.

99
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,460
So that is the
point, 2, negative 1.

100
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,960
Right?

101
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,780
The x value here is 2.
y value is negative 1.

102
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,070
Now, that's what we got
just by eyeballing it,

103
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,340
and clearly these are
hand-drawn graphs.

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,670
Not very precise.

105
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,300
Let's verify or let's
see if 2, negative 1

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,380
does satisfy both
of these equations,

107
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,980
if it's an x and y value
that satisfies both and lies

108
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,570
on both the graphs.

109
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,090
So if you put 2, negative
1 in this first equation,

110
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,090
you get 5 times 2, plus
3 times negative 1,

111
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,810
and we're going to see
if that is equal to 7.

112
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,460
So this is 10 plus negative 3.

113
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,940
So that's the same
thing as 10 minus 3.

114
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,290
Does that equal 7?

115
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,040
And yeah, it does.

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,650
10 minus 3 is equal to 7.

117
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,770
So 2, negative 1 is
definitely on that graph

118
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,220
or definitely satisfies
that equation.

119
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,120
And then, let's do it
with the other one.

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,080
So if we do 2, negative
1, you have 3 times

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,750
2, minus 2 times negative 1.

122
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,610
And we're testing to see
if that is equal to 8.

123
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,450
So 3 times 2.

124
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,300
3 times 2 is 6.

125
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,840
And then 2 times
negative 1 is negative 2.

126
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,270
But then, we're subtracting
that, so it's 6 plus 2.

127
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,830
6 plus 2 is equal to 8.

128
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,600
And it definitely does equal 8.

129
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,540
So we have the coordinate
or we have the point,

130
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,320
2, negative 1 satisfying
both equations.

131
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,727
So we've solved the system of
linear equations by graphing.

132
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,227

1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,930
Let's say that this is you.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,140
You're enjoying
a nice sunny day,

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,590
and you decided to take a
nice long, deep breath of air.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,630
And of course, when
I say air, the part

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,050
that you probably
care the most about

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,900
is just the oxygen
part of that air.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,980
That's the part that we,
as humans, need to survive.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,170
So you take a deep
breath, and let's say

9
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,671
that you take it
through your mouth.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,780
You take a deep breath
through your mouth.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,160
And then let's say you
take one more deep breath,

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,090
a second deep breath.

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,940
And you take that one
through your nose.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,680
Now you might think, well, these
are two totally different ways

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,780
of getting in air.

16
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:38,204
That's certainly
how it looks when

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,050
you look at a mouth and a nose.

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,800
It doesn't look like
they have much in common.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,110
But the truth is that actually.

20
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,790
If you follow the air, it almost
follows an identical path.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,750
So the air is going to go
into the back of the throat,

22
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,400
really regardless of
how you took it in.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,630
So here we have air
coming in from the nose.

24
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,900
And here you have air
coming in from the mouth.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,240
And they meet up in
the back of the throat.

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,519
And then they go
down, down, down.

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,340
They go towards this thing
that we call the Adam's apple.

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,860
I'm going to bring up a
little bit of the canvas

29
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,085
so you can see it more easily.

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,150
But basically, you see this
Adam's apple right here.

31
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,727
And actually you can
go ahead and take

32
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,460
a feel of your own Adam's apple.

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,060
It's a pretty cool structure
in the middle of your throat,

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,410
and everybody has it.

35
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,380
That's the first
thing I want to tell

36
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,310
you is that everybody
has it, not just men.

37
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,970
Women have it too.

38
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,110
And the reason it's
called an Adam's apple,

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,090
it's called an Adam's apple
because Adam is generally

40
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,410
a boy's name.

41
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,130
And so it's to remind us
that usually men or boys have

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,050
larger Adam's apples than girls.

43
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,010
And if you're trying to find it,
I just also want to point out

44
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,850
there's this notch here.

45
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,650
And if you can feel the
notch with your fingers,

46
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,070
that gives you a nice clue
as to where it's located.

47
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,510
But this is it.

48
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:03,549
This is the Adam's apple.

49
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,540
And what it does is it helps
you control your voice.

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,960
And actually, another name for
the Adam's apple, sometimes

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,820
people call it the voice box.

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,090
The voice box.

53
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,470
And of course, air is passing
through the voice box,

54
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,660
and it's kind of the
entryway into the trachea.

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,450
And so it actually
allows me to (FALSETTO)

56
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,540
make my voice really
high, (DEEP BARITONE)

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,300
or make my voice
very low, depending

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,890
on how you change the muscles
around in that Adam's apple.

59
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,925
So that's actually the
kind of first cool thing

60
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,055
I want to point out to you
is that you can actually

61
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,560
control your voice.

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,540
I'm sure you knew this
already, but what you're using

63
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,020
is your Adam's apple,
or your voice box.

64
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,590
Now air keeps going.

65
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,760
Air is just going to keep
making its journey down--

66
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,310
and specifically, of
course, the part of air

67
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,170
I said we care
about is the oxygen.

68
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,440
It's going to keep
making its journey down

69
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,160
into the lung area.

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,670
So this is now the lung area.

71
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,910
It's going down the trachea,
and it goes into the two lungs--

72
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,130
the right and left lung.

73
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,010
This is the left lung.

74
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,350
I'm going to put L for left.

75
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,790
And this is the right lung.

76
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,860
I'll put R for right.

77
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:14,072
And immediately you're
thinking, well, wait a second,

78
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,010
aren't they switched?

79
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:16,472
I want you to
remember that this is

80
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,120
from the perspective of the
person who owns the lungs,

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,070
so that's why I'm putting
left where I put it

82
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,630
and right where I put it.

83
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,650
Now we should probably
go ahead and start

84
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,810
labeling some of this.

85
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,290
You can see that the lungs
actually don't look identical.

86
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,010
They look slightly different.

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,040
For example, this
one has three lobes.

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,700
The right side has three lobes.

89
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,960
We call it the upper lobe,
middle lobe and lower lobe.

90
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,240
And the left one
only has two lobes.

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,190
So that's the first
kind of big difference.

92
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,290
And the other difference
is that you actually

93
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,930
have this thing in the middle
that we call a cardiac notch.

94
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,630
This thing right here, this
is called the cardiac notch.

95
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,700
And the reason we
call it that is

96
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,810
that it's a little
spot that gets

97
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,690
formed because the
heart is literally

98
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,070
kind of peeking out here.

99
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,380
And as a result, it
kind of makes a notch

100
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,360
in the lungs when it develops.

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,610
So the heart takes up a
little bit of space here.

102
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,330
This is our heart.

103
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,619
And as a result, it
makes that notch.

104
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,360
So this is our heart space here.

105
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,726
So on the other
side, you've got,

106
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,870
of course, your two lobes--
your upper and lower lobe.

107
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,600
And these are two clues, so if
you ever see a lung just kind

108
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,562
of sitting by itself and
you want to figure out

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,980
whether it's the left
lung or the right lung,

110
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,490
you can look for
the number of lobes,

111
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,130
or you can look for
that cardiac notch.

112
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,710
Now around these
lungs, you've got ribs.

113
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,220
So you've got ribs here,
and between the ribs,

114
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,920
you've got rib muscles.

115
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,300
And they are, of
course, on both sides.

116
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,970
And below the lungs
and below the heart,

117
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,640
you've got a big muscle.

118
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,250
Actually it's going
to come through here.

119
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,220
I'm going to just kind of
go through the word heart.

120
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,730
And it basically
becomes the floor.

121
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,690
So the heart and
the two lungs, they

122
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,940
sit on this floor made
up of this muscle.

123
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,820
And this muscle is
the diaphragm muscle.

124
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,360
So this diaphragm muscle
makes up the floor.

125
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,850
The ribs make up the walls.

126
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,000
So what do we have?

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,780
We have basically a room.

128
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,970
We have a giant room
with walls and a floor.

129
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,690
And this entire room we
actually call the thorax.

130
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,670
So within this room then,
you have your two lungs

131
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,960
and your heart.

132
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,860
So far, so good.

133
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,284
But I haven't done a very nice
job of actually showing you

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,250
where the air goes.

135
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:48,789
I've just kind of pointed that
it goes through the two lungs,

136
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,360
but you don't actually get to
see where it goes after that.

137
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,760
So I'm going to
erase a lot of this.

138
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm going to reveal
to you what it

139
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,090
would look like if you could
slip on some X-ray glasses

140
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,660
and look at your two lungs.

141
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,370
This is kind of what
it would look like.

142
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,540
You've got all this
interesting architecture.

143
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,600
And the easiest way to
think about this, probably

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,830
the simplest way to think about
this, is to imagine a tree.

145
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,520
So imagine a tree, and that tree
has been flipped upside down.

146
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,590
So you've got all these
branches off that tree.

147
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,120
And they're branching
and branching.

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,660
And if you flip this
tree upside down,

149
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,430
you start seeing that
it looks a lot like what

150
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,390
we have in our lungs.

151
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,350
Our lungs basically look like
a flipped upside down tree.

152
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,650
And we even call it that.

153
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,810
We even call this
entire structure,

154
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,760
we call it a bronchial tree.

155
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,180
So when you look at
the lungs and they

156
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,730
look kind of messy
or complicated,

157
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,670
just think of them as an upside
down bronchial tree, and all

158
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,270
of a sudden it'll
look much simpler.

159
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,340
Basically in the middle,
you've got this nice trunk.

160
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,840
Right?

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,820
This is our trunk.

162
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,870
And then it starts kind
of branching from there.

163
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,610
So air goes down this main
trunk, this trachea, and then

164
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,750
it kind of starts splitting up.

165
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,720
And each of these colored
regions-- the green region

166
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,090
or the purple region--
serves a different lobe.

167
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,190
So this green region serves
the lower lobe down here.

168
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,540
The purple serves
the upper lobe.

169
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,960
And on this side, you've got
an upper, a middle, and a lower

170
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:23,461
lobe.

171
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,010
Now I know it looks a little
bit strange, because you've

172
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,610
got some green branches in
what should be the middle lobe,

173
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,570
like right here.

174
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,186
You've got some orange
branches in what

175
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,740
looks like the upper
lobe, like right there.

176
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,414
But what you have to
remember-- and this

177
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,110
is kind of tricky
to do and just try

178
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,590
to play with it
in your head-- is

179
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,600
that what you have is basically
a three-dimensional lung.

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,410
So you have to imagine
that we are only

181
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,130
looking at it from
the front side.

182
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,640
But, of course, that
middle lobe does go back.

183
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,220
And if it went back, then
you'd make perfect sense

184
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,020
of why the orange branches
are where they're at.

185
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Now let me continue
the air journey,

186
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,180
because I want to make
sure we finish it off.

187
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,680
So let's say we take a little
branch like this, we expand it.

188
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,790
We keep zooming into
it, zooming into it,

189
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,840
zooming into until
it's microscopic.

190
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,820
You can't see it with
your eyes anymore,

191
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,220
but you could see it
under a microscope.

192
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,370
It would look like this.

193
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,120
It would basically,
under a microscope,

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,280
look like a bunch of
little sacs like this.

195
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,850
And these sacs, we
call these alveoli.

196
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,480
Alveoli.

197
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,320
And the air actually kind
of runs into the alveoli.

198
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,470
It has a dead end, and
then it comes back around.

199
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,970
And then you breathe it out.

200
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,490
So that's how breathing works.

201
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,660
The air goes all the way
in through your mouth, down

202
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:42,886
to the alveoli, takes a
U-turn, and then goes back out.

203
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,900
But before it does
that, before it leaves,

204
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,480
very close to the
alveoli is blood.

205
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,720
And let's say blood is coming
this way and going that way.

206
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,700
And what will happen is
that actually into the blood

207
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,150
will go oxygen.

208
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,710
Oxygen will actually
go into the blood.

209
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,390
And out of the
blood will be waste.

210
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,770
So you'll have some
carbon dioxide waste

211
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,970
that your cells
have been making.

212
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,650
And that waste
actually then gets

213
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,430
thrown back into the alveoli.

214
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,560
So now you can see how oxygen
gets from the outside world,

215
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,790
gets breathed in through
the lungs when you inhale,

216
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,540
gets down into the alveoli,
exchanges with the blood,

217
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,520
and then you exhale and let
all that carbon dioxide out.

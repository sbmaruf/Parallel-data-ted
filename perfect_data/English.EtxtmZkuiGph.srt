1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,110
This brain teaser is a bit of
a classic, and I'm sure a

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,600
bunch of you have
heard it before.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,510
But I wanted to include this in
the brain teaser playlist

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,770
that I'm making right now.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,480
Because this one is actually a
good build up, and a bit of a

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,379
nice warm up session for a
slightly harder brain teaser

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,840
that deals with people telling
the truth and lying.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,025
So this one, we could call it
the truth teller and the liar.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,350

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,490
So we're on some type of
adventure quest, and we get to

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,020
a fork in a road, right?

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,680
So let's say that there's
two doors.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,340
That's even better.

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,710
So there's two doors.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,770
And I've gotten to the end of my
adventure quest. And I know

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,700
that my treasure is behind
one of these two doors.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,790
Unfortunately, behind the other
door is slow and painful

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,870
death, and all of the
misery in the world.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,590
So I want to pick the
door carefully.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,340
And beside the doors, there are
two people sitting there.

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,780
There's one guy that
looks like this.

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,950
And then there's another guy
that looks like this.

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,270
And I know for a fact - the
gods of brain teasers have

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,250
come and told me - that both of
these guys know which door

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,870
has the treasure, and both of
these guys know which door has

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,350
the unbelievable despair
that would ensue if

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,980
I opened that door.

29
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,870
So both of these
guys know which

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,270
door I should be opening.

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,070
And I also know, and both of
them know, that one of them

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,740
always tells the truth.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:51,325
One is always honest. And then
one of them always lies.

34
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:56,700

35
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,370
And the problem is I don't
know who's who.

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,230
And I only have one chance.

37
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,800
Obviously I can't just open
a door and close it.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,710
If I open the wrong door,
the despair will

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,990
come out and kill.

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,709
And you know, all of the
pain will happen.

41
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,030
And I can only ask one question
of one of them to

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,340
decide which door to open.

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,670
So remember, they both know
the correct answer.

44
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,160
But one of them always lies.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,710
One of them always
tells the truth.

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,730
And I only have one question
to ask of one of them.

47
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,350
So the brain teaser is: What
question do you ask?

48
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,780
Who do you ask it to?

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,700
Do you ask it to the green
guy or to the brown guy?

50
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,300
And then what do you do based
on what they tell you?

51
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,370
So that is the problem
description.

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,020
And I will now give
you the solution.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,150
So if you don't want
the solution, and I

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,110
encourage you not to.

55
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,320
I think if you think about this
one for maybe 20 or 30

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,690
minutes, or at most a day.

57
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,020
Sometimes when you sleep
on a brain teaser it

58
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,770
might come to you.

59
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,420
So I encourage you to do that.

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,390
So pause it, stop
it, whatever.

61
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,730
Don't listen anymore.

62
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,850
Because here is the solution.

63
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,950
So what you do is-- I mean,
you don't know who's who.

64
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,170
So it's not like there's a
correct answer on who you ask

65
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,340
a question of.

66
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:20,860
But what you do is you ask you
either of the people, what

67
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:31,720
would the other guy say is
the correct door to open?

68
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,900

69
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,000
So let's think about this.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,260
So I could ask this guy, I'm
asking the green guy, what

71
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,220
would this guy say is the
correct door to open?

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,480
Now what happens if this
guy tells the truth?

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,200
If this guy tells the
truth, then this

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,970
guy's the liar, right?

75
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,790
And so he will actually
tell me what this guy

76
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,040
would tell me to do.

77
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,360

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,240
So what would the other guy
say is the correct door to

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,960
open, right?

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,950
So this guy, if you were to tell
him the correct door to

81
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,550
open, he would tell you the
incorrect door to open.

82
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,440
Right?

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,700
So when you ask this guy what
would that guy say, he'll be

84
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,590
honest about what this
guy would say.

85
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,270
And since he's a liar,
he would tell you

86
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,400
the incorrect door.

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,930
So the answer to this question,
you would get the

88
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,370
incorrect door.

89
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,150
Incorrect door would be the
answer to that question if

90
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,620
this guy's the truth teller
and this guy's the liar.

91
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,060
Now what happens if it's
the other way around?

92
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,530
What if I ask this guy and he
happens to be the liar?

93
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,350
So this guy's the liar, this
guy's the truth teller.

94
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,210
So the liar, he can't
help himself.

95
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,570
He will lie.

96
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,790
So he knows that this other
guy is the truth

97
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,550
teller there, right?

98
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,770
There's only two
of them there.

99
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,400
He knows this guy's
the truth teller.

100
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,820
And he knows that this guy
when asked will say the

101
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,000
correct door to open.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,430
So if you happened to be lucky
and you ask this guy the

103
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,230
correct door, he would
tell it to you.

104
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,090
This guy will lie.

105
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,040
Let's say that this is the
correct door, door number two

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,290
is the correct door.

107
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,680

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,990
So let's say that door number
two is the correct door.

109
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,565
If you ask this guy directly,
he'll say oh

110
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:29,510
yeah, door number two.

111
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,770
You'll find all your happiness
behind door number two.

112
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,910
Now if this guy's a liar, he
knows that the truth teller

113
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,860
will say door number two.

114
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,030
But he's a liar, so he'll tell
you door number one.

115
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,130
So once again, if I ask the same
question of the liar, I

116
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,250
still get the incorrect door.

117
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,560
Right?

118
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,350
So no matter who I ask this
question to, their answer will

119
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,680
be the wrong door, the incorrect
door, or the door

120
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,800
that I get all of
the pain from.

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,530
So what you do is you ask this
question, what would the other

122
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,920
guy say is the correct
door to open?

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,150
And no matter who you ask that
to, they're going to answer

124
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,910
the incorrect door.

125
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,220
And so you do the opposite.

126
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,940
So I ask this guy, mister green
guy, what would mister

127
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,530
brown guy say is the correct
door to open?

128
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:26,960
And green guy will say brown guy
will tell you to open door

129
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,430
number one.

130
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,280
Well green guy says that brown
guy will tell me to open door

131
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,040
number one, then I should
open up door number two.

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,290
And likewise, if green guy says
brown guy will say to

133
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,450
open door number two, then I
should open door number one.

134
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,680
Anyway that's a nice warm up
brain teaser for the next one

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,390
I'm going to give you.

136
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,667

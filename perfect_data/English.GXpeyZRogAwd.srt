1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,870
We're asked to graph this
function, finding the roots

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,660
and the vertex of
this parabola.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,150
So to find the roots, when
people talk about roots,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,870
they're talking about the points
of intersection of this

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,470
function and the x-axis.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,740
So this is the x-axis here,
and this is the y-axis.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,110
And you're going to intersect
the x-axis when

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,480
y is equal to 0.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,730
So to find the roots, we said
y is equal to 0, so we solve

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,230
the equation, x squared plus
4x minus 12 is equal to 0.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,750
All I did is I said y is equal
to 0, and I swapped the left-

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,270
and right-hand sides.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,080
Now, to factor this, we have a 1
as a leading coefficient, so

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,760
we don't have to do the
all out grouping.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,610
We can just think, are there two
numbers whose products are

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,850
negative 12, and if I
add them I get 4?

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,960
So let's think about it.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,060
It looks like 2, positive 6, and
negative 2 would work, if

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,600
I go through all of negative
12's factors.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,540
So this can be factored as x
plus 6, times x minus 2.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,310
6 minus 2 is 4.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,500
6 times negative 2 is negative
12, so that's going to be

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,520
equal to 0.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,840
And if we have two numbers,
and if, when you multiply

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,290
them, they equal 0, that means
that either x plus 6 is equal

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,490
to 0, or x minus 2
is equal to 0.

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,600
Subtract 6 from both sides of
this equation, you get x is

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,430
equal to negative 6.

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,790
Add 2 to both sides of this
equation, and you get x is

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,140
equal to 2.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,010
So y is equal to 0 when x is
equal to negative 6, or x is

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,910
equal to 2.

33
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,680
So let's graph both
of those points.

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,130
x is equal to negative 6,
y will be equal to 0.

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,600
So x is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
So negative 6 comma 0.

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,940
That will be on the graph of
this function, or the graph of

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,380
this parabola.

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,360
And also the point,
x is equal to 2.

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,680
So 1, 2.

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Just like that. x
is equal to 2.

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,580
So this is the point 2, 0.

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,360
Now to find the x value of the
vertex, there's actually

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,960
several ways of doing it.

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,810
There is a formula that
gives it to you.

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,480
But actually, the easiest way
to figure it out is it's

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,240
actually going to be the
midpoint between the two 0's.

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,280
If you already figured out the
0's, the x value where the

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,840
vertex was going to lie--
because the two 0's are always

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,630
symmetric around the axis of
symmetry, which is the same x

51
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,340
value as the vertex.

52
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,760
You can just find the midpoint
of these two points, and that

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,500
will be the x value
of the vertex.

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,900
So let's just do that.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,280
So if we take the midpoint, we
can literally just average

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,100
these two numbers.

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,270
So negative 6 plus 2, over 2 is
negative 4 over 2, which is

58
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,725
equal to negative 2.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,680
So the vertex is x is
equal to negative 2.

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,780
And when x is equal to negative
2, what is y?

61
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,020
So x is the vertex, and then y
will be equal to negative 2

62
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,560
squared, is positive 4.

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,570
4 times negative 2
is negative 8.

64
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,840
And then we have a
minus 12 there.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,280
So 4 minus 8 gets us to negative
4, minus another 12

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,940
is negative 16.

67
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,760
So the point negative
2, negative 16 is

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,500
going to be our vertex.

69
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,330
So let me graph that.

70
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,060
I think it's going to fall off
of this graph a little bit.

71
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,470
So negative 2, and then we're
going to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

72
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:34,750
7, 8, 9, 10 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16.

73
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,210
So it's going to be
right around here.

74
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,830
We went off the graph paper.

75
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:47,020
But negative 2 all the way
down to negative 16.

76
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,630
So that right there
is the vertex.

77
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,580
Negative 2, negative 16.

78
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,550
All the way down here.

79
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,540
We can even lower the y-axis.

80
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,250
And so if I were going to graph
the parabola, it would

81
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,690
look something like this.

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,900
It would look something
like that.

83
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,470
Just like that and obviously
it would keep going.

84
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,980
Now, I figured out the vertex
in this problem just by

85
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,530
averaging the x values
of the two routes.

86
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,700
That gave me the x value of the
axis of symmetry, which is

87
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,460
this right here. x is
equal to negative 2.

88
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,399
That's the axis around which
the parabola is symmetric.

89
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,859
The other way to figure out the
x value of the vertex, is

90
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,560
to use the formula, negative
b over 2a.

91
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:29,805
So the x value of the vertex
is equal to negative b--

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,230
negative 4-- over 2 times a.

93
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,860
a is 1, so over 2, which is also
going to give you x is

94
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,150
equal to negative 2.

95
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,380
Now, the last way to solve for
the vertex is to complete the

96
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,790
square on this parabola
right here.

97
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,710
So what we can do is
we can rewrite it.

98
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,910
We can say this is y is equal
to x squared plus 4x.

99
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,960
I'm going to put the
minus 12 out here.

100
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,685
And what we want to do is add
and subtract the same number,

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,890
so I can express this
as a perfect square.

102
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,230
So if I take 1/2 of 4x, or if I
take 1/2 of 4, I get 2 if I

103
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,440
square that.

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,810
I could add a 4 here, and
then subtract a 4.

105
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,110
And then what that does is it
turns this into x plus 2

106
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,940
squared, right? x plus 2
squared is x squared

107
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,570
plus 4x, plus 4.

108
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,160
We've seen that multiple
times.

109
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,870
So you have x plus 2 squared.

110
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,740
And then you have the minus
4 minus 12, minus 16.

111
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,540
So this is just another
way of writing

112
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,910
this exact same function.

113
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,790
But when you write it this way
you see that the lowest point,

114
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,300
this part of the function right
here is always positive.

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,650
It's a quantity squared.

116
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,100
The lowest value that
it can be is 0.

117
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,040
But then it can only
go up from 0.

118
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,840
So the lowest point, the lowest
y value we can take on,

119
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,650
is when this expression
right here is 0.

120
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,990
And when that happens, the
y value is negative 16.

121
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,070
Now, what x makes
this value 0?

122
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,580
Well, x equals negative
2 will make this 0.

123
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,310
If you wanted to say, x plus 2
is equal to 0, this expression

124
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,170
right here is going to be 0 when
x plus 2 is equal to 0.

125
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,460
Subtract 2 from both sides,
x is equal to negative 2.

126
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,730
So that's another way to find
the vertex, all of them

127
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,380
equally valid.

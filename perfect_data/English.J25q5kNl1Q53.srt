1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650


2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,610
We're asked to add 50 plus 0.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,240
Well, zero is nothing.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,660
So you can imagine that we're
starting off with 50 of

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,890
something, and if we add nothing
to that 50, we're

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,320
still going to have 50
of that something.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,280
If I have three of something and
I added nothing, I'm still

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,680
going to have three, so anything
plus zero is going to

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,140
be whatever you started
off with.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,420
So 50 plus 0 is going
to still be 50.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:30,999

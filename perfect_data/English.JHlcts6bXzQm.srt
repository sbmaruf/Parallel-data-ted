1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,230
Divide.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,770
Simplify the answer and write
as a mixed number.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,230
And we have 2 and 1/4 divided
by 1 and 3/4.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,150
So the first thing we want to
do since both of these are

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,260
mixed numbers is to
convert them both

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,500
into improper fractions.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,740
So let's start with 2 and 1/4.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,850
So we're still going to have
4 in the denominator, but

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,030
instead of 2 and 1/4,
remember, 2 is the

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,680
same thing as 8/4.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,340
So we have 8/4, and then
we have another 1/4.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,230
That gives us 9/4.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,900
Or another way to come up with
this 9, you take 4 times 2,

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,990
which is 8, plus 1.

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,370
That gives you 9.

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,720
And then the 1 and 3/4,
same process.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,880
You're going to have 4 in the
denominator, and then the

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,780
numerator is going to be 4 times
1, which is 4, plus 3,

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,450
which is 7.

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,990
So this is the exact
same problem here.

21
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,370
2 and 1/4 divided by 1 and 3/4
is the same thing as 9/4

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,860
divided by 7/4.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,200
And we saw in several videos
already that dividing by a

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,000
fraction is the same thing as
multiplying by its reciprocal.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,900
So this is equivalent to-- so
these are all equivalent.

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,960
This is equivalent to 9/4 times
the reciprocal of this.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,833
We're changing the division
operation to a multiplication,

28
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,390
and we're taking the reciprocal
of the 7/4.

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,490
For the reciprocal of 7/4, you
swap the numerator and

30
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,100
denominator, or the top
number and the bottom

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,730
number, and you get 4/7.

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,950
Now, we could just
multiply these.

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,380
We could just say this is 9
times 4, which would be 36,

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,590
over 4 times 7, which is 28,
and then try to put it in

35
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,900
lowest terms, or we could do it
right now because it would

36
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,290
be simpler.

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,820
We have a 4 in the numerator.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,560
We have a 4 in the denominator,
that'll

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,080
eventually be in the
denominator, so let's divide

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,280
our eventual numerators
and our eventual

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
denominators both by 4.

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,040
So you divide this 4
by 4, you get 1.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,070
This 4 by 4, you get 1.

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,990
So now when you multiply it, you
get 9 times 1, which is 9,

45
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,660
over 1 times 7, which is 7.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,680
So we have our answer,
but right now,

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,150
it's an improper fraction.

48
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,160
They want us to write it
as a mixed number.

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
And to figure it out as a mixed
number, we can do it in

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,160
our heads now.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
I think we've seen this
enough times.

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,190
We say how many times
does 7 go into 9?

53
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,020
Well, it goes into it exactly
one time, but when you take 7

54
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,720
into 9 one time, what do
you have left over?

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,190
Well, you're going to have
2 left over, right?

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,650
7 times 1 is 7, and you're going
to have 2 left over.

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,015
You need 2 more to get to 9.

58
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:37,920
So you're going to have 2 left
over, so this is 1 and 2/7.

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
And we're done!

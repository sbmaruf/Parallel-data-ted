1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,810
Use the quadratic formula to
solve the equation, 0 is equal

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:10,500
to negative 7q squared
plus 2q plus 9.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,230
Now, the quadratic formula, it
applies to any quadratic

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,750
equation of the form--
we could put the 0 on

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,600
the left hand side.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,160
0 is equal to ax squared
plus bx plus c.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,170
And we generally deal with x's,
in this problem we're

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,230
dealing with q's.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,980
But the quadratic formula says,
look, if you have a

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,150
quadratic equation of this form,
that the solutions of

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,610
this equation are going to be
x is going to be equal to

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:44,330
negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,150
4ac-- all of that over 2a.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,000
And this is actually two
solutions here, because

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,350
there's one solution where you
take the positive square root

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,910
and there's another solution
where you take

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,030
the negative root.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,680
So it gives you both
roots of this.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,030
So if we look at the quadratic
equation that we need to solve

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,250
here, we can just
pattern match.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,980
We're dealing with q's, not
x's, but this is the same

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,850
general idea.

23
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,420
It could be x's if you like.

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,550
And if we look at it, negative
7 corresponds to a.

25
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,600
That is our a.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,320
It's the coefficient on the
second degree term.

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,290
2 corresponds to b.

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,250
It is the coefficient on
the first degree term.

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,880
And then 9 corresponds to c.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,250
It's the constant.

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,440
So, let's just apply the
quadratic formula.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,510
The quadratic formula will tell
us that the solutions--

33
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,600
the q's that satisfy this
equation-- q will be equal to

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,440
negative b.

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,390
b is 2.

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:53,840
Plus or minus the square root
of b squared, of 2 squared,

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:08,220
minus 4 times a times negative
7 times c, which is 9.

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,639
And all of that over 2a.

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,020
All of that over 2 times
a, which is once

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,400
again negative 7.

41
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:22,760
And then we just have
to evaluate this.

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,190
So this is going to be equal
to negative 2 plus or minus

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,160
the square root of-- let's see,
2 squared is 4-- and then

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,962
if we just take this part right
here, if we just take

45
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:42,470
the negative 4 times negative
7 times 9, this negative and

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,890
that negative is going
to cancel out.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,960
So it's just going to become
a positive number.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,220
And 4 times 7 times 9.

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,720
4 times 9 is 36.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,270
36 times 7.

51
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,710
Let's do it up here.

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,060
36 times 7.

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,780
7 times 6 is 42.

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,350
7 times 3, or 3 times 7 is 21.

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,500
Plus 4 is 25.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,420
252.

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,290
So this becomes 4 plus 252.

58
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,430
Remember, you have a
negative 7 and you

59
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,830
have a minus out front.

60
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,020
Those cancel out, that's why
we have a positive 252 for

61
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,950
that part right there.

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,220
And then our denominator,
2 times negative

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,800
7 is negative 14.

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,050
Now what does this equal?

65
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,460
Well, we have this is equal to
negative 2 plus or minus the

66
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,080
square root of-- what's
4 plus 252?

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,410
It's just 256.

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,860
All of that over negative 14.

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,600
And what's 256?

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,580
What's the square root of 256?

71
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,360
It's 16.

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,420
You can try it out
for yourself.

73
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,810
This is 16 times 16.

74
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,160
So the square root
of 256 is 16.

75
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,400
So we can rewrite this whole
thing as being equal to

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,500
negative 2 plus 16
over negative 14.

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,790
Or negative 2 minus-- right?

78
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,180
This is plus 16 over
negative 14.

79
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,490
Or minus 16 over negative 14.

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,740
If you think of it as plus or
minus, that plus is that plus

81
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,720
right there.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,510
And if you have that minus,
that minus is

83
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,250
that minus right there.

84
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,910
Now we just have to evaluate
these two numbers.

85
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,010
Negative 2 plus 16 is 14 divided
by negative 14 is

86
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,170
negative 1.

87
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,470
So q could be equal
to negative 1.

88
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,430
Or negative 2 minus 16 is
negative 18 divided by

89
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,320
negative 14 is equal
to 18 over 14.

90
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,500
The negatives cancel out, which
is equal to 9 over 7.

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,190
So q could be equal to negative
1, or it could be

92
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,500
equal to 9 over 7.

93
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,100
And you could try these out,
substitute these q's back into

94
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,460
this original equation, and
verify for yourself that they

95
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,350
satisfy it.

96
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,900
We could even do it with
the first one.

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,750
So if you take q is equal
to negative 1.

98
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,795
Negative 7 times negative 1
squared-- negative 1 squared

99
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:17,210
is just 1-- so this would be
negative 7 times 1, right?

100
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,920
That's negative 1 squared.

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,260
Negative 1 times 2 is
minus 2 plus 9.

102
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,150
So it's negative 7 minus 2,
which is negative 9, plus 9,

103
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,960
does indeed equal 0.

104
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,180
So this checks out.

105
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,780
And I'll leave it up to you
to verify that 9 over

106
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,150
7 also works out.

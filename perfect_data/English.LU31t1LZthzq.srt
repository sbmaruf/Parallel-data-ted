1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This means, "I'm smiling."

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So does that.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This means "mouse."

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
"Cat."

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here we have a story.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The start of the story, where this means guy,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here's where it happens.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
These are when.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She wears it every day.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's not considered vintage --

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's because she dances.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
(Laughter)

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And he could say, "Oh my God!"

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or "I heart you!"

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
"I'm laughing out loud."

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
"I want to give you a hug."

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But he comes up with that, you know.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
(Laughter)

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Put a crab inside it.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Add some water.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Seven different salts.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but just panhandle at the ocean.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At least, that's how it seems.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm a monkey --

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
(Laughter) --

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
blowing kisses

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
at a butterfly.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
First, soon, and then a lot.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hell, ponytail alone.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know what else to tell you.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I got a pencil you can borrow.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can put it in your phone."

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She just says, "No thank you."

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You know?

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
(Applause)

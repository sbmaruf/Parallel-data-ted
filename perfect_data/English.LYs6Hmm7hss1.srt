1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,730
We're asked to find the
square root of 100.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,130
Let me write this down bigger.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,060
So the square root is this
big check-looking thing.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,880
The square root of 100.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,650
When you see it like this,
this means the

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,120
positive square root.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,850
If you're familiar with negative
numbers, you know

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,490
that there's also a negative
square root, but when you just

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,700
see this symbol, that means
the positive square root.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,570
So let's think about what
this is saying.

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,090
This is asking us find the
number, the positive number,

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,350
that when I multiply that number
by itself, I get 100.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,700
So what number when I multiply
it by itself do I get 100?

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,220
Well, let's see, if I multiply
9 by itself, that's

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,580
only going to be 81.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,280
If I multiply 10 by itself,
that is 100.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,800
So this is equal to-- and let
me write it this way.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,740
Normally, you could
skip this step.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,470
But you could write this as
the square root of-- and

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,610
instead of 100, 100 is the same
thing as 10 times 10.

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,960
And then you know, the square
root of something times

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,890
itself, that's just going
to be that something.

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,240
This is just equal to 10.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,720
So the square root
of 100 is 10.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,330
Or another way you could write,
I guess, this same

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,520
truth is that 10 squared, which
is equal to 10 times 10,

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,000
is equal to 100.

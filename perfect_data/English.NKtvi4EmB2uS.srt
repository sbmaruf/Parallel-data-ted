2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,500
On Thursday, the 8th of November

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Six days before it launched Operation Pillar of Cloud

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Israel killed 13-year-old Ahmed Younes Abu Dagga

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
Also known as Hamid,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,500
He was killed right here

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
while he was playing football with his friends.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,800
He died on the way to hospital

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,500
This man, Saleh, witnessed Hamid’s death.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hamid was shot in his stomach

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and he ran towards the steps of his home.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We took him to the hospital in a car

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
But he died on the way.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
At the time, my crew and I were
filming a few hundred meters away

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Near the Israeli-imposed no-go military zone

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Investigating an incursion into Gaza.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
This is the buffer zone.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,000
We are greeted with the sounds of
helicopters and Israeli drones.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is an Israeli tank, part of that incursion,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just hundreds of meters away from Hamid’s home.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We heard live fire at the time
Hamid was killed and ran to cover.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We had no idea Israel had killed an innocent.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I visited Hamid’s school to speak to two boys
who were playing with him when he was killed.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
On Thursday we were playing football and suddenly

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I heard Hamid screaming and
shouting, “My stomach, my stomach!”

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then we saw him run to his
home while holding his stomach.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He started to call out for his mum.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
His brother was there who started
asking us, What’s wrong with Hamid?”

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I answered him that they shot him in his stomach.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He was shocked and said, “You mean Hamid?!”

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I answered, “Yes!” then the car came to take him.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
As recent history has shown, no where
in Gaza is safe for Palestinians

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But Hamid’s family home in Abasan, Khan Yunis is just a few
hundred meters from the military buffer zone with Israel.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Its horizons under constant domination
by Israel’s surveillance balloons.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It’s one of the least secure places to live in Gaza

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But for the large Abu Dagga family,
it’s simply always been their home.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It was my shift that night at the hospital.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,500
Suddenly, we heard the noise of shelling and shooting because
the hospital is close to the east, near the boarder with Israel.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
After five minutes, a casualty arrived to the hospital.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
He was a child, and we immediately started treating him.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When we took him, we could see that he appeared to be dead.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We massaged his heart and gave him drugs like
adrenalin and a drip to try to restart his

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
heart to beat again or to make him breathe
again, to bring him back to life,

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But unfortunately the child was
injured directly in his heart.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Ahmed was more than a brother to me.

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
He was my friend.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I spent most of my time with him.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We used to play football together in the streets
and always used to play Playstation together.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We were together most of the time.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
What happened affected me a lot.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I feel my heart is empty.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Even yesterday, I had my friends visiting
me at home and when they wanted to leave,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I accidently said, “Hamid, Ahmed, show them downstairs!”
I forgot that he was dead.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
May his soul rest in peace.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I said to myself, “We put our trust
in God, the best of planners.”

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Near Hamid’s home, there’s also a sniper outpost.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Although a Hamas official initially reported
that a helicopter shooting killed Hamid,

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It’s not clear whether it was shrapnel
from a sniper or helicopter bullet,

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
or even shrapnel from a tank shelling that was responsible.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is just another incident of a suspicious Palestinian
child casualty as a result of Israeli force.

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,000
We were surprised by the injury because there was no bullet.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When there is a gunshot, there is
an entry wound and an exit wound,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but the child had only two very small holes on
the right side and the left side of his torso,

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
on both sides of his body.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
This proves that it was not a gunshot,
but shrapnel that killed Hamid,

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
due to a shelling and the shrapnel
entered his chest directly.

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,000
It hit his heart, and when we examined
him, we found two very small holes,

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
two millimeters in size, on both sides.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Here in the hospital, we deal with the children's
injuries with our very limited treatment capabilities.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
Our limited ability is one of our biggest problems

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:03,000
because here in the hospital we are suffering from
a shortage of the most basic medical supplies.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Mohammad was another boy playing
football with Hamid when he was killed,

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I first spoke to his parents

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hamid was here with us, and then suddenly, in seconds,
we were surprised, he was gone, he was dead.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My child was with him, I felt bad because my child was
in the same place, may Ahmed’s soul rest in peace.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I ask the international community to stand
up for the rights of Gaza’s children.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No one in this world cares about the
children or people here in Gaza.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We ask God to finish this occupation,
God willing, as soon as possible.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
May Ahmed rest in peace in Heaven.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hamid came to my home and invited
me to play football with him.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I accepted.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Before we left my home, he asked me to take photos of him

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So I took photos of him and he
asked me to put them on Facebook.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
After the afternoon prayer, I went to his home,
and we played football from 3 until 4 pm.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is Hamid

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Suddenly, we heard shooting and shelling
and Hamid fell down as he passed the ball.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I started screaming, saying, “Get down, there is shooting!”

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hamid went to the ground while our other friends ran away.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He started crying and I started calling for his brothers

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then suddenly, he stood up, saying,
“Oh, my stomach, my stomach!”

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He started running towards his home and I screamed
to his brother, “Come, Hamid has been shot!”

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then he started running around his home, screaming.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
His brother came and told me to find
a car to take him to the hospital.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My child, Mohammed, has his exams these days.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Whenever I ask him to study hard to succeed,
he opens his books and then starts crying.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
“I can’t, I can’t study.”

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
All the time, he holds his mobile phone
and looks at the photo he took of Hamid.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I told him to focus on his studies,
to pray, and I said to him,

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
“Look how God chose Hamid to be a martyr,
and go to Heaven. He was lucky!”.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He always answers, “I can’t, I can’t
because what happened affected me a lot.”

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He’s all the time crying and looking at Hamid’s photo.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now the boys play with Hamid’s football, but without Hamid

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Human Rights Watch told me they didn’t have the
resources in Gaza to investigate the killing of Hamid.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hamid’s killing was, of course, barely
reported by Western media agencies.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The BBC ran one limited article in which Hamid’s
killing was reported as just an unverified,

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
alleged incident of collateral damage.

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Days after it killed Hamid, Israel launched
its November operation Pillar of Cloud,

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
claiming it was responding to rocket
fire from Gazan militant groups

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Rocket fire that killed no one.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
After Hamid’s death, in the weekend
just preceding the operation,

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Israel killed two more Palestinian children when
it struck near a funeral parade in North Gaza.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The truth is that the timeline of the recent war
started with Israel’s killing of Hamid, buried here.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This was Hamid’s classroom.
A memorial wreath stands on his chair.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just before he was killed, he was
sitting tests in Geography, and Maths

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We all went to school together and
went home as a group every day.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Every Thursday, we used to play football together.

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Sometimes he would invite me, sometimes I would
invite him, and we used to go out a lot together.

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
My brother was a religious fan of Real Madrid.

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He used to download the videos of all
their games and goals to watch them play.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Playing football was his biggest hobby.

121
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,000
He always dreamed of becoming a football star.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He always pretended he was Cristiano Ronaldo and he was
killed while he was wearing a Real Madrid t-shirt.

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Glorious is God: he lived loving football
and he died while he was playing it.

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What can a child care about
except his school and having fun?

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
These are the only things children think of.

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,500
He only cared about wearing his Real
Madrid t-shirt, his Real Madrid boots,

127
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,000
grabbing his football, and then going to play.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He did not even really care about his studies.

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hamid even said on Thursday morning,

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,500
“I have a big responsibility, I have two exams on Saturday!”

131
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,000
And Israelis thought that he was
thinking about shooting rockets?!

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hamid’s mother was motionless with grief.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Some relatives wanted to show me
Hamid’s bedroom and possessions:

134
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
his bed,

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
backpack, and mobile.

136
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
His schoolbooks,

137
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
football boots,

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the t-shirt Hamid was wearing when he was martyred.

139
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
The weapons they use are unbelievable.

140
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
We have received many injuries of
this kind, not only with children

141
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Ahmed is one of them.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They’re all the same.

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There are very small holes in the chest,
stomach, really, anywhere in the body.

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Sometimes two holes.

145
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
But when we resuscitate them, and
take them to perform surgery,

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
we see shocking damage, including
lacerations in the intestines.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Wherever the injury is, we see incredible damage.

148
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,000
So we saw injuries similar to Ahmed’s
back during Operation Cast Lead.

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,500
Since Hamid was killed, in Gaza alone,

150
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,500
a further 61 Palestinian children have
been killed by Israeli state violence.

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I went to Hamid’s funeral parade.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,050
The pupils from his preparatory school arrived.

153
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,500
Glory to our faithful martyrs.

154
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The local police force also paid their respects.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I say to the world, you accepted agreements
and protocols to protect Human Rights

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
during wartime and during peacetime,
like the Geneva Convention

157
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and the jurisdiction of the International
Criminal Court in the Hague.

158
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This international community is sitting
silently when it comes to Israeli violations

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
against the Palestinian children and people.

160
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They are being killed day and night by the Israelis
who think that no power in the world can stop them.

161
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
To the soldier that shot my son, he has
to know that he killed an innocent child.

162
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Of course, he has his own children.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How would he feel if he saw his son being causelessly killed

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
while he was playing football with his friends?

165
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What’s the crime he committed?

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are our children being unduly
killed in front of their homes?

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We ask God to end this occupation.

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I call on President, Barak Obama,
who just won a second term,

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the new president of the USA that
speaks in the name of freedom:

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Do the American people accept for a child to be killed
while he was playing football in front of his home?

171
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,000
If this happened there, in America, the
whole world would stand against it.

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If this child has been killed inside Israel,
would the state of Israel have stayed silent?

173
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why does the international community continue its silence?

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is a massacre of children inside Gaza.

175
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The reckless killing or murder of this
13-year-old Real Madrid-supporting child

176
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
constitutes a prima facie war crime
committed by the state of Israel.

177
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
One day the International Criminal
Court will call for witnesses:

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
My crew and I will be there.

179
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
My message to the world and to everyone listening,

180
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
pay attention to our plight.

181
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
We are poor and oppressed people.

182
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:57,000
We have lived 65 years suffering from
occupation, killing and colonizing.

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
God willing, people of the world will start
to care and put a stop to all of this.

184
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What can I say to the Israeli 
soldier who killed my brother?

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They are not human because they killed
a little child playing football.

186
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What kind of terrorism did he commit?

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,500
They say they attack terrorists and rocket firers.

188
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:26,000
My brother Hamid was playing
football, not launching a rocket.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They think that when they attack our children
that we will be weakened. It is the opposite.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They raise hatred in our hearts.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now, don’t you think that Hamid’s friends
will hate the Israelis more and more?

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We are like them, we are all humans!

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What did he do for them to attack him?!

194
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Those children will grow up and
the hate will grow up with them.

195
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
God willing, the Israelis will leave our
land and the occupation will end soon.

196
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I swear to God that they will not stay here.
The end is coming soon.

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
As a doctor, as a children’s surgeon, I want to say
that we are a people of peace and that we love peace.

198
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And my message to the world is please stand by the
people of Palestine so that we can live in peace,

199
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so our children and their children
can live together in peace.

200
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why do the people of the world live in freedom

201
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
while the children of Palestine do not know the
meaning of freedom or sleep peacefully at night?

202
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So this is my message:

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
stand by the children and the people of Palestine.

204
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We should stop the killing.

205
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000

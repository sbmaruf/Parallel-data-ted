Find the measurement of angle CAD, so angle CAD.. this angle right over here..

2
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:15,467
measure of that angle, let's just call it x, so that I don't have to keep writing the measure of angle CAD

3
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:20,133
and the other thing that might jump out at you is that the measures of the other angles' measures  are given here..

4
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,333
50 degrees, 45 degrees and 37 degrees.  The other thing that might jump out at you

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:28,537
if you take the outer edge of all these angles which are adjacent to each other

6
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:34,867
if you take the outer edge, it forms a straight angle.  So this entire angle is going to be 180 degrees.

7
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:41,935
Or another way to think about it is the measure of each of these angles, when you add them all together needs to be 180 degrees

8
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:50,067
.. and that's what we need to solve this problem.  Because we have x plus 50 (50 in orange),

9
00:00:50,067 --> 00:01:15,933
+ 45+ 37 is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And now these, let's see 50+45=95. 95+37 is 132. So all

10
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:22,500
of that is 132. We can subtract 132 from both sides.

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:34,067
On our left hand side we are just left with x. On our right hand side, 180-132 is 48 And we're done!

12
00:01:34,067 --> 99:59:59,000
X is equal to the measure of this angle over here which is equal to 48 degrees.

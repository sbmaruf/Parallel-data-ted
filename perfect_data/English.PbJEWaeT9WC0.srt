1
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:05,092
This is "like". This is "dislike".

2
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:16,467
6 years that Thailand's three Muslim provinces 
have been under emergency decree

3
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:24,324
Countless number of people was affected by the unjust power and control from government officers under the decree.

4
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:30,488
Emergency decree isn't a good law

5
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:40,841
Those who were arrested got tortured in order to make them confess

6
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,264
This is not right

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,946
Because when being tortured, those who couldn't stand the pain, 
they just had to admit even though they didn't do anything

8
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:52,108
This is not right

9
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:59,388
If they really did wrong, there should be evidence and punishment accordingly

10
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:03,784
Entering the 8th year of violence in three Muslim provinces

11
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:07,746
Many groups and civil society organizations have been established with the same objective 
and determination to see peace once again in the areas

12
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:17,179
As well as the Civil Society Network Against Emergency Decree

13
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,751
that has been continuously campaigning against the decree with different activities varied from releasing statements

14
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,284
holding different campaigns like kicking out the decree

15
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:33,438
by driving classical cars and motorbikes,

16
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:37,983
to organizing a people's forum against the decree

17
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,959
Recently, the activity has been lifted to international level with "Post Peace Campaign"

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,187
by allowing local people to express their opinions and intentions towards this emergency decree on postcards

19
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:05,465
as reflections of their feelings and make their voices heard among representatives of international organizations.

20
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:19,667
Today, we're going to make an action by collecting voices of people who want to call for stopping emergency decree

21
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:38,258
by writing short messages that we want to express to the United Nations on these postcards

22
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:43,157
and we'll send all of them to the head quarter of U.N. in Thailand on this coming 10 December which is the Thai Constitution Day's and also International Human Rights Day

23
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:52,200
The campaign to express people's feelings on postcards

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,812
has received good response from local people,

25
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:59,019
especially those working in city area in Pattani that got effects from such decree.

26
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:09,177
I hope the situation will be normal soon so I can work more conveniently

27
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:18,554
When going to pray or elsewhere during early morning, 
I don't need to worry that I'll be searched by the army or arrested for investigation

28
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:23,550
I think there must be campaign against emergency decree

29
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:30,350
This emergency decree has been enforced for a long while

30
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:40,965
and its enforcement has violated basic rights of local people in our areas

31
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:46,531
We no longer agree with the emergency decree enforcement in our areas

32
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:55,224
If it's still necessary to use the emergency decree then there must be justice

33
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:58,061
If there's no justice, then it should be repealed

34
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,532
The movement of the Civil Society Network Against Emergency Decree doesn't only aim to have the decree repealed

35
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:13,986
but also to reduce the condition that could lead to endless violence

36
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:21,877
Time has proven that the emergency decree couldn't reduce the incidents

37
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:25,966
and it even creates hatred among the people who were affected by the unjust power and control of officers

38
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:35,547
Therefore, should the New Year present that the current government of Ms. Yingluck Chinnawatra

39
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:45,923
would give to people who oppose the emergency decree in three Muslim provinces on this coming 19 December be repealing the emergency decree?

40
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:52,635
We oppose the emergency decree!

41
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,400
We oppose the emergency decree!

42
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,721
We oppose the emergency decree!

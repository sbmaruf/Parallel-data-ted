1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,500
Let's start again with a point.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's call that point point
A. And what I'm curious about

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,530
is all of the points on
my screen right over here,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,860
that are exactly 2
centimeters away from A.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,090
So 2 centimeters on my
screen is about that far.

6
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:17,552
So clearly if I
start at A and I go

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,410
2 centimeters in that direction,
this point right over there,

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,840
is 2 centimeters from A. If
I call that point, point B,

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,600
then I could say line
segment AB is 2 centimeters.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,930
The length is 2 centimeters.

11
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:33,276
Remember this would refer
to the actual line segment.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,330
I could say this looks nice,
but if I talk about its length,

13
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:37,792
I would get rid of
that line on top

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,580
and I would just say
AB is equal to 2.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,540
If I wanted to put units I
could say 2 centimenters.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,450
But I'm not curious just about
B, I want to think about all

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,805
of the points, the set
of all of the points

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,330
that are exactly 2
centimeters away from A.

19
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,810
So I could go 2 centimeters
in the other direction,

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,190
maybe get to point
C right over here.

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,170
So AC is also going to be
equal to 2 centimeters,

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,970
but I could go 2 centimeters
in any direction.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,910
And so if I find the
set of all of the points

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,150
that are exactly 2
centimeters away from A,

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,970
I will get a very familiar
looking shape, like this,

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,930
and I'm trying to
draw it freehand.

27
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,420
So I would get a shape
that looks like this.

28
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:17,594
Actually, let me draw it in.

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,170
I don't want to make you think
that it's only the points where

30
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:22,753
there's white, it's all of
these points right over here.

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,250
I don't want to draw a dashed
line over there, which maybe I

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,570
should just, let me
clear out all of these

33
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,610
and I'll just draw
it as a solid line.

34
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,660
So this could look
something like that.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,380
My best attempt.

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,500
And this set of all
of the points that

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,430
are exactly 2
centimeters away from A,

38
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:47,235
this is a circle, as I'm sure
you are already familiar with.

39
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,029
But that is the formal
definition-- the set

40
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,590
of all points that
are a fixed distance,

41
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,610
or that have a fixed
distance, from A

42
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,410
that are a given
distance from A.

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,350
If I said the set of all points
that are 3 centimeters from A,

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,530
it might look
something like this.

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,150
It might look
something like that.

46
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,580
That would give
us another circle.

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,990
I think you get
the general idea.

48
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,452
Now what I want to
do in this video

49
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,180
is introduce ourselves into
some of the concepts and words

50
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,540
that we use when
dealing with circles.

51
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,980
So let me get rid of
that 3-centimeter circle.

52
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:22,795
So first of all, let's
think about this distance.

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,200
This distance, or one
of these line segments

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,420
that join A, which we would
call the center of the circle.

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,230
So we'll call A the
center of the circle,

56
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,731
and it makes sense
just from the way

57
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,250
we use the word center
in everyday life.

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,510
What I want to do is think
about what line segment AB is.

59
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,740
AB connects the center and it
connects a point on the circle

60
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,320
itself.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,530
Remember, the circle itself
is all of the points that

62
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:50,138
are equal distance
from the center.

63
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,510
So AB, any line
segment, I should say,

64
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,150
that connects the center
to a point on the circle,

65
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,280
we would call a radius.

66
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,880
And so the length of the
radius, AB over here,

67
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,340
is equal to 2 centimeters.

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,830
And you're probably already
familiar with the word radius,

69
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,660
but I'm just being a
little bit more formal.

70
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:11,463
And what's interesting
about geometry,

71
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,190
at least when you start learning
it at the high school level,

72
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,220
is it's probably the
first class where you're

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,780
introduced into a slightly more
formal mathematics, where we're

74
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,720
a little bit more careful
about giving our definitions

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,330
and then building
on those definitions

76
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,850
to come up with
interesting results

77
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,530
and proving to ourselves
that we definitely

78
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,710
know what we think we know.

79
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:30,672
And so that's why we're
being a little bit more

80
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,410
careful with our
language over here.

81
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,690
So AB is our radius,
line segment AB, and so

82
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,840
is line segment-- let me
draw another point on here,

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,770
let's say this is X-- so line
segment AX is also a radius.

84
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,560
Now you can also have other
forms of lines and line

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,010
segments that interact
in interesting ways

86
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,750
with the circle.

87
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,680
So you could have a line
that just intersects

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,110
that circle at
exactly one point.

89
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,530
So let's call that point right
over there, let's call that D.

90
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,570
And let's say you have a
line, and the only point

91
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,760
on the circle-- the only point
in the set of all of the points

92
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,260
that are equal distant from A,
the only point on that circle

93
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,290
that is also on that
line is point D.

94
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,190
And we could call that line l.

95
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,390
So sometimes you'll
see lines specified

96
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,350
by some of the points on them.

97
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,540
So for example, if I had another
point right over here called E,

98
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,190
we could call this line
line DE, or we could just

99
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,840
put a little script
letter here with an l

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,370
and say this is line l.

101
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,010
But this line that only
has one point in common

102
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,590
with our circle, we call
this a tangent line.

103
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,700
So line l is a tangent.

104
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,080
It is tangent to the circle.

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,170
So let me write it
this way, line l

106
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,550
is tangent-- you normally
wouldn't write it

107
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,916
in caps like this,
I'm just doing

108
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,840
that for emphasis-- is tangent
to-- instead of writing

109
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,250
the circle centered
at A, you'll sometimes

110
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,050
see this notation-- to
the circle centered at A.

111
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,589
So this tells us that this is
the circle we're talking about.

112
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,060
Because who knows, maybe we
had another circle over here

113
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,180
that is centered at
M, another circle.

114
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,380
So we have to specify it's
not tangent to that one,

115
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,560
it's tangent to this one.

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,570
So this circle with
a dot in the middle

117
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,040
tells we're talking
about a circle,

118
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,010
and this is a circle
centered at point

119
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,800
A. I want to be very clear,
point A is not on the circle,

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,590
point A is the
center of the circle.

121
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,660
The points on the circle
are the points equal distant

122
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,800
from point A. Now, l is
tangent, because it only

123
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
intersects the
circle in one point.

124
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,620
You could just as
easily imagine a line

125
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,350
that intersects the
circle at two points.

126
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,250
So we could call, maybe
this is F and this is G,

127
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,050
you could call that line FG.

128
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,120
So we could write it
like this, line FG.

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,610
And this line that
intersects it at two points,

130
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,890
we call this a
secant of circle A.

131
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,160
It is a secant line to this
circle right over here,

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,770
because it intersects
it in two points.

133
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,770
Now, if FG was just
a segment, if it

134
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,690
didn't keep on going forever,
like lines like to do,

135
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,850
if we only spoke about
this line segment--

136
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,320
let me do this in a new
color-- if we only spoke

137
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,140
about this line segment
between F and G,

138
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,170
and not thinking about going on
forever, then all of a sudden

139
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,430
we have a line segment,
which we would specify there.

140
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,730
And we would call this
a chord of the circle,

141
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:49,480
a chord of circle A. It starts
at a point on the circle,

142
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,970
a point that is exactly in
this case 2 centimeters away,

143
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,950
and then it finishes at
a point on the circle.

144
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,150
So it connects two
points on the circle.

145
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,550
Now, you could have
chords like this,

146
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:02,627
and you can also have a
chord, as you can imagine,

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,930
a chord that actually
goes through the center

148
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,280
of the circle.

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,980
So let's call this
point, point H,

150
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,210
and you have a straight line
connecting F to H through A.

151
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,500
So that's about as straight
as I could draw it.

152
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,290
So if you have a
chord like that,

153
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,240
that contains the actual
center of the circle,

154
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,164
of course it goes from
one point of the circle

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,580
to another point of
the circle, and it goes

156
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,180
through the center
of the circle,

157
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:39,050
we call that a diameter of A.

158
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,990
And you've probably seen
this in tons of problems

159
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,460
before, when we were not talking
about geometry as formally,

160
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,520
but the diameter is made
up of exactly two radiuses.

161
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,670
We already know that a radius
connects a point to the center.

162
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,920
So you have one
radius right over here

163
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,580
that connects F and
A, that's one radius,

164
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,400
and then you have
another radius connecting

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,620
A and H, the center to
a point on the circle.

166
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,810
So the diameter is made
up of these two radiuses,

167
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,500
or radii I should
call it, I think

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,570
that's the plural for radius.

169
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,000
And so the length
of a diameter is

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,700
going to be twice the
length of a radius.

171
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,530
So we could say the length of
the diameter, so the length

172
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,580
of FH-- and once again I don't
put the line on top of it

173
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,300
when I'm just talking
about the length--

174
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,410
is going to be equal to
FA, the length of segment

175
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,370
FA, plus the length
of segment AH.

176
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,310
Now there's one
last thing I want

177
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,309
to talk about when we're
dealing with circles,

178
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,359
and that's the idea of an arc.

179
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,760
So we also have the parts
of the circle itself.

180
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,600
So let me draw another
circle over here.

181
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,510
Let's center this circle
right over here at B.

182
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:52,076
And I'm going to find
all of the points that

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,470
are a given distance from
B. So it has some radius,

184
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,150
I'm not going to specify
it right over here,

185
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,490
and let me pick some random
points on the circle.

186
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:10,130
So let's call this J, let's
call that K, let's call this S,

187
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,300
let's call this T, let's
call this U right over here.

188
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:16,877
And I know it doesn't look that
centered, let me try to center

189
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,830
B a little bit better.

190
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,520
Let me erase that.

191
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,110
And if I put B a
little bit closer

192
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,260
to the center of the circle, so
that's my best shot, so let's

193
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,220
put B right over there.

194
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,130
Now, one interesting
thing is, what do you

195
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,340
call the length of the circle
that goes between two points?

196
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,140
So what would you call-- let
me get a good color here--

197
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,610
what would you call this?

198
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:40,437
Well, you could imagine
in everyday language

199
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,990
we would call something
that looks like that an arc,

200
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,140
and we would also call
that an arc in geometry.

201
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,350
To specify this
arc we would call

202
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,460
this JK, the two
endpoints of the arc,

203
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,826
the two points on
the circle that

204
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,370
are the endpoints
of the arc, and you

205
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,131
use a little notation like that.

206
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,030
So you put a little curve on
top instead of a straight line.

207
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,620
Now you could also have
another arc that connects JK,

208
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,010
this is the minor arc.

209
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,250
It is the shortest way along
the circle to connect J and K,

210
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,670
but you could also go
the other way around.

211
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,390
You could also have
this thing that

212
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,570
goes all the way
around the circle.

213
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,660
And we would call
that the major arc.

214
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,870
And normally when you
specify a major arc, just

215
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,030
to show that you're going
the long way around,

216
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,420
it's not the shortest way
to get between J and K,

217
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,840
you'll often specify
another point

218
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,920
that you're going through.

219
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:30,353
So for example, this major arc
we could specify we start at J,

220
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,530
we went through-- we could
have said U, T, or S,

221
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,890
but I'll put T right over
there-- we went through T

222
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,170
and then we went
all the way to K.

223
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,010
And so this specifies
the major arc

224
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,472
and this thing could have been
the same thing as if I wrote

225
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,050
JUK, these are specifying
the same thing, or JSK.

226
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,150
So there's multiple ways
to specify this major arc

227
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,990
right over here.

228
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,790
But the one thing
I make clear is,

229
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,590
is that the minor arc is
the shortest distance,

230
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,750
so this is the minor arc, and
the longer distance around

231
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,000
is the major arc.

232
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,020
And I'll leave you there and
maybe the next few videos we'll

233
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,590
start playing with some of this
notation a little bit more.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660


2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,410
In the last part of the problem
we figured out that the

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,420
function of the height of the
ferris wheel, the people at the

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,140
ferris wheel at any time is a
function of t. h of t is equal

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:18,590
to 9 minus 8 cosine of 18t
where t is in seconds.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,730
Now the second part of this
problem they want us to graph h

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,530
as a function of t between 0 is
less than or equal to t, is

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,800
less than or equal to 30.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,500
So let me draw axes.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,690
So let's say that
that's my h-axis.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,660
Let's say that this
is my t-axis.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:53,280


13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,845
So this is t equals 0, and this
is t is equal to 30 seconds.

14
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:00,740


15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,660
I get confused when I see
this 18 here or whatever.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,040
So what I'm going to do first
of all is I'm going to graph a

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,230
different function, slightly
different function, then I'll

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,870
translate it to this function.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,820
I'm going to graph h of
theta is equal to 9

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:23,430
minus 8 cosine of theta.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,010
I think you'll see where
I'm going with this

22
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,320
when I'm all done.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,600
So let's try to graph h
of theta is equal to 9

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,260
minus 8 cosine of theta.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,810
So when t is equal
to 30 seconds, what

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,090
is theta equal to?

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,800
So 30 times 18, that's 540.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,780
So this is 540 degrees.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,370
Same thing.

30
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,340
I'll write the thetas in
red above the t-axis.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,310
This is 540 degrees, so
that's like two times

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,940
around the circle.

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,470
So that's 540 degrees,
then this is going to

34
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,890
be roughly 270 degrees.

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,400


36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,450
So, 90 degrees will be
about 1/3 of this.

37
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,830
That would be 90 degrees, that
would be 180, so that would be

38
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:11,680
90 degrees, that would be 180
degrees, this would be 360

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,910
degrees, and this would be 360
plus 90 so this will

40
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,140
be 450 degrees.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,390
If you wanted to figure out
the corresponding time,

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,680
you just take this
degree and divide by 18.

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,300
So it's 90 divided
by 18 is what?

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,175
It's five, right?

45
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:39,360
So if I were to write here,
this is at 5 seconds, this is

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,400
at 10 seconds, this is 15
seconds, this is 20 seconds,

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,910
this is -- sorry, this is 25
seconds, this is 30 seconds.

48
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,140
Actually, a simple thing we
could do is let's just figure

49
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,640
out what the value of the
function is at these points.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,690
Because these are pretty
easy degrees to figure out

51
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,810
what the cosine value is.

52
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,160
So let's figure out --
let me draw a table.

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,740
Tables are always good and
I'll do it in yellow.

54
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,520
So I'll draw a t theta and h.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,720


56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,160
This might be kind of an
unconventional way of doing

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,170
things, but I have a simple
mind so this is actually

58
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,680
how I like to do it.

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,460
So I like to think of
theta as 0, 90, 180,

60
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:42,810
270, 360, 450 and 540.

61
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,160
And t, the corresponding
time of those, as 0,

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,170
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

63
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,850
It's not rocket science here.

64
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,470
When t equals 15 seconds,
15 times 18, we're trying

65
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,120
to find the cosine of
270 degrees, right?

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,080
15 times 18 is 270 degrees.

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,740
I'm just doing this because I
don't have a calculator and

68
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,480
this will help me
pick good points.

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,850
So when t is equal to
0, what is height?

70
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,750
Or t is equal to 0, theta is
equal to 0, so cosine of theta

71
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,800
is -- cosine of 0 is 1.

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,090
So 9 minus 8 is 1.

73
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,610
I'm going to do h in
a different color.

74
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,540
So this is 1.

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,430
Cosine of 90 degrees?

76
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,180
Cosine of 90 degrees is 0.

77
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,170
So 9 minus 0 is 9.

78
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,885
Cosine of 180 degrees?

79
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,960
So we're going all the way
around the unit circle.

80
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,310
Cosine of 180
degrees is minus 1.

81
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:47,770
So minus 1 times minus 8 is
plus 8, so 9 plus 8, that's 15.

82
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,500
Cosine of 270 degrees are
pointing straight down, so the

83
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,670
x-coord is going to be 0.

84
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,540
So once again,
we're at 9 again.

85
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,930
9 minus 0.

86
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,900
360 degrees.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Cosine of 360 degrees
is the same thing as

88
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,390
cosine of 0, right?

89
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,080
So once again, I mean we've
gone around the circle once.

90
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,480
So it's going to be the same
as 0, so it's going to be 1.

91
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,420
And 450 is going to be
the same thing as 90.

92
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,250
So it's going to be 9
and then 15 degrees.

93
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,690
So let's plot these points.

94
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,980
Actually, let me just
draw 15 up here.

95
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,820
So what are the points
that keep showing up?

96
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:33,310
So this is 1, that's 1, that's
1, and then we have 9.

97
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:44,685
1, there's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

98
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:48,320


99
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,970
Fair enough.

100
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,380
So let me draw some
guidelines just to help us.

101
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,760


102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,270
Actually, let me do them kind
of hard to see, because I

103
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,400
don't want to draw too much
attention to the guidelines.

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,100
I could do one guideline there.

105
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,970


106
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,075
Then I'll do a bottom
guideline right there.

107
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:20,040


108
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,690
Then the 9 keeps showing up.

109
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,020


110
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,260
Oh, you know what, I can't add.

111
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,060
What's 9 plus 8?

112
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,330
It's not 15, it's 17.

113
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:37,580
Sorry, clearly, I need to
practice my addition.

114
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,970
So this is 9 plus
8, this is 17.

115
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,890
And I realized that because I
was like, well 9 should be in

116
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,820
the middle, so this
is actually 17.

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
Ignore my little marks here.

118
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,520
That's 17, this is 1.

119
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,470
Ignore the marks.

120
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,130
9 would be right in the
middle between 1 and 17.

121
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,290
So let me draw kind of
mediant point right there.

122
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,820
So this is 9.

123
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,150
Sorry I can't add properly.

124
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,230
Then let's draw the graph
or at least plot the

125
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,820
points on the graph.

126
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:15,240
So, t equals 0 where h equals
1, so that's this point.

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,020
That's right here.

128
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,540
When t equals 5, h is
equal to 9, right here.

129
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,350
When t is equal to 10,
h is equal to 17.

130
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,380


131
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,280
When t is equal to
15, h is 9 again.

132
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,510
So it's right here.

133
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,040
At 20 we're back at 1.

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,590
I think you see the pattern.

135
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,570
At 25 we're back at 9.

136
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,500
And then at 30 we're back at
17, not 15, because now I

137
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,330
have corrected my mistake.

138
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,270
And this is going to be sined
graph, it's going to look

139
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,360
something like this.

140
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,080
Let me do it in a vibrant color
so I can overwrite everything

141
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,130
and it's going to look
something like this.

142
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,466
Go oops, and then up
and them down here.

143
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:11,180


144
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:19,100
Curve up, come back down, curve
up and then come back down.

145
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,060
Like that.

146
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,490
So that's our graph.

147
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,850
I think in the problem they
tell us to approximate.

148
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:30,910
Actually, let me open up my
cousin's problem -- my other

149
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,120
account has timed-out on
me while I recorded this.

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,080
They wanted to approximate when
t equals 4 what the height is.

151
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,030
So when t equals 4 the
height is like right

152
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,440
around there, right?

153
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,650
So the height is a
little bit less than 9.

154
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,500
And I don't know, 7 or
8 meters in the air.

155
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,770
And when time is equal to 10 --
well, time equal 10, we figured

156
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,930
out exactly, we know that there
are 17 meters in the air.

157
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,510
So I know this was kind of a
little messy and graphing

158
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,770
trick functions tend to be,
but hopefully you found

159
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,160
this vaguely useful.

160
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,620
Have fun.

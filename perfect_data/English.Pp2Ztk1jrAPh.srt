1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,370
A suspension bridge has two
towers that rise 500 feet

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,390
above the road and are connected
by cables that hang

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,410
in the shape of a parabola that
can be represented by y

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:19,990
is equal to 1/8,960 times x
minus 2,100 squared plus 8,

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,200
where x and y are measured in
feet and x is the distance

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,450
from the left tower in the
direction of the right tower.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,980
What is the distance between
the two towers?

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,330
Let's draw ourselves
a diagram.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,130
If we draw the leftmost
tower-- I'm

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,640
going to do it in orange.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,960
So we have the left
tower right here.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,510
That tower is at x
is equal to 0.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,490
We'll call that x is equal to 0,
or maybe just call that the

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,480
0 point right there.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,940
Then x is just measuring the
distance from that leftmost

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,600
tower to the rightmost tower, so
the rightmost tower in the

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,060
direction of the right tower.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,145
This right here, maybe
the right tower

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,099
is right over here.

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,680
They're both 500 feet high.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,510
The right tower is right over
there, and we don't

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,240
know where it is.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,930
That's we have to figure out.

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,880
We have to figure out the
distance between the two, but

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,650
we just need to know that x is
measuring this distance.

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,810
It's measuring the distance
from the left tower in the

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,050
direction of the right tower, so
it's just traditional, just

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,540
like our coordinate plane.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,020
That is what x is measuring.

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,560
If you say x is equal to a
million feet, you're going to

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,190
get something way beyond
that second tower.

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,910
If you say x is one foot, you're
going to get something

33
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,840
in the direction of the second
tower from the left tower.

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
So that's x, and then y, we can
assume is the height of

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,680
the towers, or is just the
height in general that we're

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,830
dealing with.

37
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,860
This is the y-axis, so we're
just dealing in the first

38
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,470
quadrant of the coordinate
plane, and that is y.

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,220
They're telling us that this
parabola, the shape of the

40
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,350
parabola, can be represented--
or even better, they're saying

41
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,320
that the cable that connects
these two is in

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,420
the shape of a parabola.

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,690
Let me draw that parabola
right there.

44
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,550
They're the same height, so
the parabola will look

45
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,800
something like this.

46
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,840
What we can do to figure out,
or one possible technique--

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,530
let me draw a better
parabola there.

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,290
That's even worse.

49
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,200
That's about as good
as I can do.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,320
One technique for finding the
distance between the two is if

51
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,040
we could figure out the
minimum point of this

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,920
parabola, which is also going
to be the vertex of that

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,970
parabola, that's going
to be halfway

54
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,940
between the two towers.

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,090
If we can figure out this
x-coordinate, we can say

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,450
that's going to be halfway
between the two towers and

57
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,170
then just multiply by two.

58
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,960
Let's see if we can figure out
this minimum point, because

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,450
the parabola is symmetric around
it, and these are both

60
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,830
at the same height.

61
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,530
Let's see if we can figure
out that minimum point.

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:57,920
Let me rewrite this equation: We
have y is equal to 1/8,960

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,070
times x minus 2,100
squared plus 8.

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,280
How do we find the minimum
point here?

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,460
This whole expression that's
squared, this whole expression

66
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,180
is always going to be positive,
or it's actually

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,770
always going to be
non-negative.

68
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,010
It could be equal to 0, and so
this whole thing is always

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,920
going to be greater than
or equal to 0.

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,520
This whole thing I'm squaring
off in orange is always going

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,440
to be greater than
or equal to 0.

72
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,540
So what is the lowest value
that y can take on?

73
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,200
The lowest valued that y can
take on will happen when this

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,930
expression is equal to 0, and
this expression equals 0 only

75
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,670
when x minus 2,100 squared
is equal to 0.

76
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,820
That's only going to be equal
to 0 when x minus 2,100 is

77
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,290
equal to 0, so x-- let me write
it this way-- equals 0,

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,650
and I'm just talking about
this orange part-- when x

79
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,650
minus 2,100 is equal to 0, or
if you add 2,100 to both

80
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,890
sides, or x is equal to 2,100.

81
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,180
When x is equal to 2,100, just
out of curiosity, what is y?

82
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,350
If x is 2,100, this thing is 0
times 0, and y is just going

83
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,900
to be equal to that 8 there.

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,460
So this coordinate right here
is the coordinate x is equal

85
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,630
to 2,100, y is equal to 8, and
it's going to be halfway

86
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,070
between our two towers.

87
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,630
If this is at 2,100, how
far is this tower away?

88
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,350
Well, it's going to
be twice 2,100.

89
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,920
It's going to be 4,200,
and everything we're

90
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
dealing with is feet.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,630
It's going to be 4,200 feet away
from that first tower.

92
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,160
So the distance between the
two towers is 4,200 feet.

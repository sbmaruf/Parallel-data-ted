1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu --

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and we'll hear about that from the

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension --

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
all of which are completely preventable for at

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
least 95 percent of people

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
just by changing diet and lifestyle.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And what's happening is that there's a

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
globalization of illness occurring, that people

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
die like us. And in one generation, for example,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
equals the HIV and AIDS deaths

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in most countries.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So there's a critical window of opportunity we

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
have to make an important difference that can

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
affect the lives of literally millions of people,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and practice preventive medicine on a global

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
scale.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
people -- not only in this country, but also

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
it's completely preventable for almost everybody.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not only preventable; it's actually

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
reversible. And for the last almost 29 years,

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we've been able to show that by simply changing

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech,

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
interventions can be like -- quantitative

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
arteriography, before and after a year, and

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
cardiac PET scans.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We showed a few months ago -- we published the

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
first study showing you can actually stop or

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
reverse the progression of prostate cancer by

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
control group.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
see it diminishing after a year.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
past 10 years, and this may be the first

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
generation in which our kids live a shorter life

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
preventable.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now these are not election returns, these are the

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
people -- the number of the people who are obese

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96,

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
kind of devolving. (Laughter)

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
diet that we've found that can reverse heart

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
disease and cancer is an Asian diet.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
are, which is why they're starting to get sick

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
like we are.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I've been working with a lot of the big food

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods,

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's,

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
business.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
from their better foods.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And so if we can do that, then we can free up

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
resources for buying drugs that you really do need

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
preventing avian flu. Thank you.

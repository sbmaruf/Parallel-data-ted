1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,730
Find the place value
of 3 in 4,356.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,190
Now, whenever I think about
place value, and the more you

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,720
do practice problems on this
it'll become a little bit of

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,600
second nature, but whenever I
see a problem like this, I

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,320
like to expand out what 4,356
really is, so let me rewrite

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,880
the number.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,940
So if I were to write it--
and I'll write it

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,210
in different colors.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:33,420
So 4,356 is equal to--
and just think about

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,360
how I just said it.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:48,190
It is equal to 4,000 plus
300 plus 50 plus 6.

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,600
And you could come up with that
just based on how we said

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,810
it: four thousand, three
hundred, and fifty-six.

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,060
Now another way to think about
this is this is just like

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:07,520
saying this is 4 thousands
plus-- or you could even think

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:16,880
of "and"-- so plus 3 hundreds
plus 50, you could think of it

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,040
as 5 tens plus 6.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,420
And instead of 6, we could
say plus 6 ones.

19
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,620
And so if we go back to the
original number 4,356, this is

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,440
the same thing as 4--
I'll write it down.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,230
Let me see how well I can-- I'll
write it up like this.

22
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:51,020
This is the same thing is 4
thousands, 3 hundreds, 5 tens

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,670
and then 6 ones.

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,820
So when they ask what is the
place value of 3 into 4,356,

25
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,120
we're concerned with
this 3 right here,

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,260
and it's place value.

27
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,090
It's in the hundreds place.

28
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,970
If there was a 4 here, that
would mean we're dealing with

29
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,850
4 hundreds.

30
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,850
If there's a 5, 5 hundreds.

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,260
It's the third from the right.

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,410
This is the ones place.

33
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,500
That's 6 ones, 5 tens,
3 hundreds.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,190
So the answer here is it is
in the hundreds place.

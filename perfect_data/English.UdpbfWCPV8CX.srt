1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,080
Let's do a couple of problems
graphing linear equations.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,280
They are a bunch of ways to
graph linear equations.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,560
What we'll do in this video
is the most basic way.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,790
Where we will just plot a
bunch of values and then

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,750
connect the dots.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,830
I think you'll see
what I'm saying.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,460
So here I have an equation,
a linear equation.

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,990
I'll rewrite it just in case
that was too small. y is equal

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,330
to 2x plus 7.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,180
I want to graph this
linear equation.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,730
Before I even take out the graph
paper, what I could do

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,450
is set up a table.

13
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,840
Where I pick a bunch of x values
and then I can figure

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,180
out what y value would
correspond to

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,980
each of those x values.

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,450
So for example, if x is equal
to-- let me start really low--

17
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,670
if x is equal to minus 2--
or negative 2, I should

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,310
say-- what is y?

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,620
Well, you substitute
negative 2 up here.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,200
It would be 2 times
negative 2 plus 7.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,060
This is negative 4 plus 7.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,270
This is equal to 3.

23
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,270
If x is equal to-- I'm just
picking x values at random

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,209
that might be indicative of--
I'll probably do three or four

25
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,190
points here.

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,470
So what happens when
x is equal to 0?

27
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,390
Then y is going to be equal
to 2 times 0 plus 7.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,530
Is going to be equal to 7.

29
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,870
I just happen to be
going up by 2.

30
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,270
You could be going up
by 1 or you could be

31
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,840
picking numbers at random.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
When x is equal to
2, what is y?

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,090
It'll be 2 times 2 plus 7.

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,070
So 4 plus 7 is equal to 11.

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,990
I could keep plotting
points if I like.

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,630
We should already have
enough to graph it.

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,700
Actually to plot any line, you
actually only need two points.

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,130
So we already have one
more than necessary.

39
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,530
Actually, let me just do one
more just to show you that

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,050
this really is a line.

41
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,750
So what happens when
x is equal to 4?

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,670
Actually, just to not go up by
2, let's do x is equal to 8.

43
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,600
Just to pick a random number.

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Then y is going to be 2 times 8
plus 7, which is-- well this

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,010
might go off of our graph
paper-- but 2 times 8 is 16

46
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,139
plus 7 is equal to 23.

47
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,940
Now let's graph it.

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,580
Let me do my y-axis
right there.

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,050
That is my y-axis.

50
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,550
Let me do my x-axis.

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,220
I have a lot of positive values
here, so a lot of space

52
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,540
on the positive y-side.

53
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,200
That is my x-axis.

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,540
And then I use the points x
is equal to negative 2.

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,420
That's negative 1.

56
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:42,440
That's 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

57
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
Those are our x values.

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,430
Then we can go up
into the y-axis.

59
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,190
I'll do it at a slightly
different scale because these

60
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,630
numbers get large
very quickly.

61
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:55,690
So maybe I'll do it in
increments of 2.

62
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:06,800
So this could be 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,370
I could just keep going
up there, but

64
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,030
let's plot these points.

65
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,540
So the first coordinate I have
is x is equal to negative 2, y

66
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,770
is equal to 3.

67
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,770
So I can write my coordinate.

68
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,945
It's going to be the point
negative 2, 3.

69
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,990
x is negative 2.

70
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,320
y is 3.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,810
3 would land right over there.

72
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,990
So that's our first one,
negative 2, 3.

73
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,050
Then our next point.

74
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,640
0, 7.

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,600
We do it in that color.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,950
0, 7.

77
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,880
x is 0.

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,340
Y is 7.

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,330
Right there.

80
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,980
0, 7.

81
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,200
We have this one
in green here.

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,340
Point 2, 11.

83
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,075
2, 11 would be right
about there.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
And then this last point-- this
is actually going to fall

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
off of my graph.

86
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,440
8, 23.

87
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,410
That's going to be way
up here someplace.

88
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,230
If you can even see
what I'm doing.

89
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,650
This is 8, 23.

90
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,090
If we connect the dots, you'll
see a line forms. Let me

91
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,000
connect these dots.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,380
I've obviously hand drawn it, so
it might not be a perfectly

93
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,390
straight line.

94
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,290
If you had a computer do it, it
would be a straight line.

95
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,029
So you could keep picking x
values and figuring out the

96
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,920
corresponding y values.

97
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,520
In the situation y is a function
of our x values.

98
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,200
If you kept plotting every
point, you'll get every line.

99
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,220
If you picked every possible x
and plotted every one, you get

100
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,400
every point on the line.

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Let's do another problem.

102
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,240
At the airport, you can
change your money from

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,490
dollars into Euros.

104
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,360
The service costs $5.

105
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,380
and for every additional dollar,
you get EUR 0.7.

106
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,470
Make a table for this and plot
the function on a graph.

107
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,430
Use your graph to determine how
many Euros you would get

108
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,320
if you give the office $50.

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,380
I will write Euros is equal to--
so let's see, it's going

110
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,710
to be dollars.

111
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,040
So you're going to have
to give your dollars.

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,290
Right off of the bat, they're
going to take $5.

113
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,320
So dollars minus 5.

114
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,430
So immediately this
service costs $5.

115
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,480
And then everything that's
leftover-- this is your

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,620
leftover-- you get EUR 0.7 for
every leftover dollars.

117
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,410
You get 0.7 for whatever's
leftover.

118
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,590
So this is the relationship.

119
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,770
Now we can plot points-- we
could actually answer their

120
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,750
question right off the bat.

121
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,190
If you give them $50, we don't
even have to look at a graph.

122
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,280
But we will look at a graph
right after this.

123
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,190
So if you did Euros is equal
to-- if you have given them

124
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,030
$50-- it would be 0.7
times 50 minus 5.

125
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,350
You gave them 50.

126
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,160
They took 5 as a service fee.

127
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,000
So this is just $45 It would
be 0.7 times 45.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,060
I could do that right here.

129
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,270
45 times 0.7.

130
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,480
7 times 5 is 35.

131
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,660
4 times 7 is 28 plus 3 is 31.

132
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,800
And then we have only one number
behind the decimal,

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,810
only this 7.

134
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,880
So it's 31.5.

135
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,530
So if you give them $50, you're
going to get EUR 31.5.

136
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,300
Euros, not dollars.

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,010
So we answered their question,
but let's actually do it

138
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,610
graphically.

139
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,330
Let's do a table.

140
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,340
Maybe I'll get a
calculator out.

141
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,580
I'll refer to that
in a little bit.

142
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,230
So let's say dollars
you give them.

143
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,200
And how many Euros do you get?

144
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,810
I'll just put a bunch
of random numbers.

145
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,100
If you give them $5, they're
just going to take

146
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,580
your $5 for the fee.

147
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,620
You're going to get $5 minus
5, which is 0 times 0.7.

148
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,600
So you're going to
get nothing back.

149
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,570
So there's really no good reason
for you to do that.

150
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,520
Then if you give them $10.

151
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,860
What's going to happen?

152
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,630
If you give them $10, 10
minus 5 is 5 times 0.7.

153
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,790
You're going to get $3-- or
I should say EUR 3.50.

154
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,430
3.5 Euros, you'll get.

155
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,690
Now what happens if
you give them $30?

156
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,840
Actually let me say 25.

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,420
If you give him $25,
25 minus 5 is 20.

158
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,620
20 times 0.7 is $14.

159
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,470
I'll do one more value.

160
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,460
Let's say you gave them $55.

161
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,650
This makes the math easy
because then you

162
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,790
subtract that 5 out.

163
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:53,170
55 minus 5 is 50 times
0.7 is $35.

164
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,260
Is that right?

165
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,230
Yep, that's right.

166
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,890
You'll get EUR 35
I should say.

167
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,500
These are all Euros.

168
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,820
I keep wanting to say dollars.

169
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,610
Let's plot this.

170
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,620
All of these values are
positive, so I only have to

171
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,240
draw the first quadrant here.

172
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,540
And so the dollars-- let's go
in increments of 5, 10, 15,

173
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:27,720
20, 25, 30, 35, 40,
45, 50, 55.

174
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,070
I made my x-axis a little
shorter than I needed to.

175
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,390
All the way up to 55.

176
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,890
And then the y-axis.

177
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,090
I'll go in increments of 5.

178
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:45,550
So that's 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30, 35.

179
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,330
Well that's a little bit too
much of an increment.

180
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,220
35.

181
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,230
Now let's plot these points.

182
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,200
I give them $5.

183
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
I get EUR 0.

184
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,070
This right here is Euros.

185
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,176
This is the dollars.

186
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,930
The dollars is the independent
variable and we figure out the

187
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,670
Euros from it.

188
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,530
Or the Euros I get
is dependent on

189
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,330
the dollars I get.

190
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,790
If I give $10, I get EUR 3.50.

191
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,430
3.50-- it's hard to read.

192
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,850
Maybe 3.50 would be right
around there.

193
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,040
If I give $25, I get EUR 14.

194
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,650
25, 14 is right about there.

195
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,090
Obviously, I'm hand drawing it,
so it's not going to be

196
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,230
quite exact.

197
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,460
If I get $55, I get EUR 35.

198
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,900
So 55, 35 right there.

199
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,450
If I were to connect to the
dots, I should get something

200
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,410
that looks pretty
close to a line.

201
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,340
If I did it-- if I was
a computer, it would

202
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,150
be exactly a line.

203
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,650
That looks pretty good.

204
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,400
Then we could eyeball what
they asked us to do.

205
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,750
Use your graph to determine how
many Euros you would get

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,590
if you give the office $50.

207
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,660
This is 50 right here.

208
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,270
So you go bam, bam, bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam, bam.

209
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,020
I'm at the graph.

210
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,900
Then you go all the way--
actually I drew that last

211
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,170
point on the graph a little
bit incorrectly.

212
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,420
Let me.

213
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,670
35 is right here.

214
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,940
Let me redraw that point.

215
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,870
35 is right there roughly.

216
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,160
So 55, 35 is right there.

217
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,900
So let me redraw my line.

218
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,880
It will look-- I lost 25.

219
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,470
25, 14 is right there.

220
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,670
So my graph looks something
like that.

221
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,010
That's my best attempt.

222
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,350
Now let's answer the question.

223
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,190
We give them $50 right there.

224
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,480
You go up, up, up, up,
up, up, up. $50.

225
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,030
The person is going to get.

226
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,430
You go all the way to
the left-hand side.

227
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,550
That's right about 31.50.

228
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,370
We figured out exactly
using the formula.

229
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,830
But you can see, you can eyeball
it from the graph and

230
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,860
figure out any amount
of dollars.

231
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,540
If you give them $20, you're
going to go all

232
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,860
the way over here.

233
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,090
You'll figure out that it should
be-- well $20 should be

234
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,540
about 7.50.

235
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,465
The imprecision in my graph-- in
my drawing the graph makes

236
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,030
it a little bit less exact.

237
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,330
When you say 20 minus 5 is 15.

238
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,230
15 times-- actually it'll
be a little over

239
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,640
$10, which is right.

240
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,480
It's right over there.

241
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,670
If you put $20 in there,
20 minus 5 is 15.

242
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,340
15 times 0.7 is $10.50,
which is right there.

243
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,850
So you can look at any point
in the graph and figure out

244
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,250
how many Euros you'll get.

245
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,130
Let's do this one where
we'll do a little bit

246
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,270
of reading a graph.

247
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,730
The graph-- I think it said
use the graph below.

248
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,420
Oh, the graph below shows
a conversion chart for

249
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,420
converting between weight
in kilograms

250
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,990
and weight in pounds.

251
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,710
Use it to convert the following
measurements.

252
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,050
We have kilograms here
and pounds here.

253
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,270
So they want 4 kilograms into
weight into pounds.

254
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,820
So if we look at this
right here, 4

255
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,640
kilograms is right there.

256
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,150
We just follow where
the graph is.

257
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,610
So 4 kilograms into pounds, it
looks like, I don't know, a

258
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,210
little bit under 9 pounds.

259
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,035
So a little bit less than--
so almost, I'll

260
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:07,930
write almost 9 pounds.

261
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,270
You can't exactly see.

262
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,310
It's a little less than
9 pounds right there.

263
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,370
4 kilograms. Now 9 kilograms.
We go over here.

264
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,310
9 kilograms. Go all
the way up.

265
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,700
That looks like almost
exactly 20 pounds.

266
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,570
Here they say 12 pounds into
weight in kilograms. Actually

267
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,030
kilograms is mass, but I
won't get particular.

268
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,120
So 12 pounds.

269
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,670
Go over here.

270
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,460
Pounds.

271
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:40,390
12 pounds in kilograms
looks like 5 1/2.

272
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,090
Approximately 5 1/2.

273
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,040
And then 17 pounds
to kilograms.

274
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,390
So 17 is right there.

275
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:58,120
17 pounds to kilograms looks
right about 7 1/2 kilograms.

276
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,910
Anyway, hopefully that these
examples made you a little bit

277
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,550
more comfortable with graphing
equations and reading graphs

278
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,290
of equations.

279
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,450
I'll see you in the
next video.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,150
Hello.

3
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,100
In the last presentation we
kind of re-defined the sine,

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,140
the cosine, and the tangent
functions in a broader way

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:15,580
where we said if we have a unit
circle and our theta is, or our

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,795
angle, is -- let me use the
right tool -- let's say, and

7
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:24,950
our angle is the angle between,
say, the x-axis and a radius in

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,570
the unit circle, and
this is our radius.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,525

10
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,870
the coordinate of the point
where this radius intersects

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,070
the unit circle is x comma y.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,490
Our new definition of the trig
functions was that sine of

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,000
theta is equal to the
y-coordinate, right, this is

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,920
y-coordinate where it
intersects the unit circle.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,400
And remember, this
is the unit circle.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,260
It's not just any circle, which
means it has a radius of 1.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,990
Cosine of theta is equal to the
x-coordinate of this point.

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,360
This is the x-coordinate.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,550
And tangent of theta
equaled opposite over

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,050
adjacent or y over x.

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,190

22
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,665
That's interesting because
that's also equal to sine of

23
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:22,060
theta over cosine of theta.

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll just do that.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I wasn't even planning on
covering that, but just it

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,370
leaves you something
to think about.

27
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,850
So with that said, let's take a
look or let's try to see how

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,940
this defines these functions.

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,120
And I guess a good place to
start is just with the sine

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,450
function and we can
try to graph it.

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,080
So let's write, let's do a
little table like we always do

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,470
when we define a function.

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,190
Let's put in values of
theta, and let's figure

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,690
out what sine of theta is.

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,370
So when theta is equal to 0
radians, what is sine of theta?

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:05,430
So when theta's 0, right, then
the radius between it -- this

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,600
is the radius and this is
the point where the radius

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,210
intersects the unit circle.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,720
And this point has a
coordinate 1 comma 0, right?

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,340

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,120
And so if where it intersects
the unit circle is at 1 comma

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,460
0, then sine of theta is
just the y-coordinate.

43
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,620
So sine of theta is 0.

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,570
If we said what is sine
of theta when theta is

45
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,870
equal to pi over 2.

46
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,840

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,370
So now our radius is this
radius and we intersect the

48
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,180
unit circle right here
at the point 0 comma 1.

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,010
And what's the y-coordinate
at 0 comma 1?

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,900
Well it's 1.

51
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,910
What happens when we have
theta is equal to pi radians?

52
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,350
So at pi radians we intersect
the unit circle right here.

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,700
We're at pi radian.

54
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,600
This is the angle, pi.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,520
We intersect with unit circle
at negative 1 comma 0.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,950
Because once again, this
is the unit circle.

57
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,790
So at negative 1 comma 0,
what's the y-coordinate?

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,410
Well, it's 0.

59
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,710
So sine of pi is equal to 0.

60
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,750
Let's just keep going
around the circle.

61
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:32,185
When we have the angle, when
theta is equal to 3 pi over 4

62
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:37,370
-- no, sorry, 3 pi over 2.

63
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,220
Because this is pi and
this is another half pi.

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,310
So this is 3 pi over 2, sorry.

65
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,720
So when theta is equal to 3 pi
over 2, what is sine of theta?

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,430
Well, now we intersect the
unit circle down here at the

67
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,920
point 0 comma negative 1.

68
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,040
So now sine of theta is
equal to negative 1.

69
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,320
Then if we go all the way
around the circle to 2

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,680
pi radians, we're back
at this point again.

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,300
So sine of theta, so we're
at 2 pi, sine of theta

72
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,960
is now 0 once again.

73
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,210
So let's graph these points out
and then we'll try to figure

74
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,970
out what the points in between
look like, and I'll show

75
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,050
you the graph of a
sine function is.

76
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:24,200

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
So let's draw the x-axis.

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,310

79
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,450
This is my x-axis.

80
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,350

81
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,595
And let's draw the y-axis.

82
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:41,180

83
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,700
Not as clean as I
wanted to draw it.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,735
This is y.

85
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:48,320

86
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,410
And that's x.

87
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,360
But in this case instead of
saying that's the x-axis, let's

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,910
call that the theta axis,
because we defined theta as the

89
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,370
input or our domains
in terms of theta.

90
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,170
So this is the theta axis.

91
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,290
Now we're going to
graph sine of theta.

92
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,565
So when we said when
theta equaled 0, sine

93
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,030
of theta is equal to 0.

94
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,260
So that's this point
right here, 0 comma 0.

95
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:24,760
When theta is equal to pi over
2, sine of theta is equal to 1.

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,680
So this is the point pi
over 2 comma 1, right?

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,270
That's just this 1.

98
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:40,610
When theta is equal to pi,
sine of theta is 0 again.

99
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,660
So this is the
point pi comma 0.

100
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:56,540
And when theta equaled 3 pi
over 2, what was sine of theta?

101
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,420
I equaled negative 1.

102
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,730
Interesting.

103
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,330
Then when we got to 2 pi --
when we got to theta equal

104
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,700
to 2 pi, sine of theta,
again, equaled 0.

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,570
So we know that these
points are on the graph

106
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,680
of sine of theta.

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,720
And if you actually tried the
points in between, and as

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,480
an exercise it might be
interesting for you to do so.

109
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,140
You could actually figure out
a lot of the points using

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,650
30-60-90 triangles or using
the Pythagorean Theorem.

111
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,930
But you actually get a curve
that looks something -- let me

112
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,630
use a nicer color than this
kind of drab grey -- you

113
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,360
get a graph that looks
something like this.

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,870

115
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,430
And you've probably
seen that before.

116
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,990
The term for this function
is actually a sine wave.

117
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,870
It looks like something
that's oscillating or

118
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,140
that's moving up and down.

119
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,390
And actually if you were to put
in thetas that were less than

120
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,470
0, the sine wave will
keep going into the

121
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,520
negative theta axis.

122
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,220
It keeps going forever
in both directions.

123
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,940
It keeps oscillating between
1 and negative 1 and

124
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,960
the points in between.

125
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,180
So that's the graph of
the sign function.

126
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,390
In the next module I'll
actually do the graph of the

127
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,350
cosine function, or actually I
might just show you the graph

128
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,840
of the cosine function.

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,580
Then I'll show you how they
relate and how these can

130
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,480
describe any kind of, or many
types of oscillatory things in

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,150
the world and how it relates to
frequency and amplitude.

132
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,740
So I'll see you in
the next module.

133
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,270
And just for fun you might want
to sit down with a piece of

134
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,920
paper and try to graph the
cosine function or the

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
tangent function as well.

136
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,160
Have fun.

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,900

1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:10,088
At 9:50am Haitham Ziad Al-Mis'hal was targeted by an unmanned

2
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:15,001
Israeli aircraft in North Gaza, justNorth of the Beach refugee camp where he

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:18,005
resided, right outside a Hamas trainingsite

4
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,072
The targeted assassination was the firstof its kind since the eight-day war of

5
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:25,065
November. The hamas government in Gazacondemned the targeting in a relatively

6
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,239
measured statement.

7
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,419
According to the Occupying state of Israel

8
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,489
Haitham was responsible for a rocket firingincident in Egypt's Sinai desert a

9
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:38,001
fortnight ago. No israelis were injuredor killed went two Grad rockets

10
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:41,064
landed in the Israeli town of Eilat.

11
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:45,086
Some of Haitham's friends and relativesarrived at the morgue to see his body.

12
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:49,013
At the mortuary Haitham's fatherconfirmed his son's involvement with

13
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:53,024
various resistance groups. All of his life he worked with the

14
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,269
resistance and

15
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:59,389
he always aspired to be martyred like his relative Ahmad al-Mis'hal.

16
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,087
Now he followed Ahmad.

17
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:06,008
The targeting of Haitham was apparently ajoint Israeli military and secret

18
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:10,041
service intelligence operation. Israelfurther claimed that Hamas knew about

19
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,055
Haitham's militant activities and failedto stop him

20
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:17,000
Israel holds the Hamas governmentresponsible for any attacks emanating

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,899
from Gaza

22
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:20,096
Hamas hasn't been able to restrain thearmed activities of some resistance

23
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:26,399
groups since it came to power in 2007. Men carried Haitham's body

24
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,042
from the morgue to his family home

25
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,014
Haitham's body was dismembered

26
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:35,057
His ankles, torn off by two drone missiles.The women of the family and neighbourhood

27
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:39,017
received the body

28
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,649
Haitham's mother said that 20 moreresistance fighters will rise up in his

29
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,939
place. She added that she hopes that theresistance groups will destroy Israel

30
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:51,082
She herself hopes to be killed defendingPalestinian land

31
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:55,087
His older sister exclaimed: where is thecease-fire? Then she said Gaza doesn't

32
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:58,019
need a cease-fire anyway.

33
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,011
Today was Haitham's [25th] birthday

34
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:04,071
Haitham had four brothers and threesisters. We spoke with his middle sister

35
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:08,869
Twelve-year-old Aya who said he was thefamily's only breadwinner

36
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:09,075
Honestly Haitham was a good

37
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:14,489
guy. He was like a caring father figure and brother. Now he is

38
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:19,629
a martyr with his Lord. We have not lost outbecause this was God's will. God's will

39
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:23,599
governs even the lives of the collaborators. I hope that God

40
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,869
kills all those who betrayed our people.

41
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:30,529
In the Catastrophe of 1948 Haitham's family was displaced from

42
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,035
al-Jorah

43
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:36,037
near Ashkelon, now inside Israel, a few miles north from his family home

44
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:39,062
According to his family Haitham was riding a motorbike when he received a

45
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:44,359
mobile phone call telling him to ridenorth to visit the unknown caller. He was

46
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,429
targeted en route.

47
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:47,899


48
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:49,739
I'm the wife of Haitham

49
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,009
We married 3 months ago. I am proud of his martyrdom. I'm pregnant.

50
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:00,008
Who's the one who's going to raise the baby inside me? God is the best of planners.

51
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:05,022
The family fears Haitham's wife will miscarry because

52
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,065
of the grief and stress

53
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:09,529


54
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:13,489
The men then proceeded to a graveyard in Sheikh Redwan where he was buried.

55
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:21,059


56
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,939
Um Amar Abu Sharaekh lives

57
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,229
directly opposite Haitham's home and helped raise him.

58
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,529
Haitham was not the first to be martyred and he won't be the last

59
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:34,809
And many will rise up like Haitham. Israel shouldn't think that our youth and our

60
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:36,849
resistance will stop rising up

61
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,087
and the one who taught Haitham will teach many more. In the future the

62
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:45,034
the rocket firers will strike further away than Tel Aviv. They will respond.

63
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:50,069
Haitham is our son and anyone martyred is our son. Anyone from the Muslim youth

64
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,179
is our son too.

65
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:54,054
Israel maintains that

66
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:58,139
they it preemptively target anyone involved in planned rocket attacks from

67
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,969
Gaza or Egypt

68
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,489
Meanwhile various militant groups herein Gaza have issued statements saying

69
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,069
that they will answer today's targeting

70
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:17,799
It's now more likely the things willescalate in Gaza in the coming days

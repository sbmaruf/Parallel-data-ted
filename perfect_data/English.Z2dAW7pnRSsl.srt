1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,620
We could have a debate about
what the most interesting cell

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,540
in the human body is, but I
think easily the neuron would

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,810
make the top five, and it's
not just because the cell

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,830
itself is interesting.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,640
The fact that it essentially
makes up our brain and our

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,420
nervous system and is
responsible for the thoughts

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,010
and our feelings and maybe for
all of our sentience, I think,

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,625
would easily make it the
top one or two cells.

10
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,920
So what I want to do is first
to show you what a neuron

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,450
looks like.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,290
And, of course, this is kind
of the perfect example.

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,670
This isn't what all
neurons look like.

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,350
And then we're going to talk
a little bit about how it

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,000
performs its function, which is
essentially communication,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,760
essentially transmitting signals
across its length,

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,400
depending on the signals
it receives.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,470
So if I were to draw
a neuron-- let me

19
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,720
pick a better color.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,750

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,060
So let's say I have a neuron.

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,120
It looks something like this.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,780
So in the middle you have your
soma and then from the soma--

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,850
let me draw the nucleus.

25
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,390
This is a nucleus, just like
any cell's nucleus.

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,190
And then the soma's considered
the body of the neuron and

27
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,260
then the neuron has these little
things sticking out

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,680
from it that keep
branching off.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
Maybe they look something
like this.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,910
I don't want to spend too much
time just drawing the neuron,

31
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,700
but you've probably seen
drawings like this before.

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,810
And these branches off of the
soma of the neuron, off of its

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,010
body, these are called
dendrites.

34
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,455
They can keep splitting
off like that.

35
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,990
I want to do a fairly reasonable
drawing so I'll

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,040
spend a little time
doing that.

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,000

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,140
So these right here, these
are dendrites.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,500
And these tend to be--
and nothing is

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,860
always the case in biology.

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,160
Sometimes different parts of
different cells perform other

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,940
functions, but these tend to be
where the neuron receives

43
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,160
its signal.

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,220
And we'll talk more about what
it means to receive and

45
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,370
transmit a signal in
this video and

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,940
probably in the next few.

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,630
So this is where it receives
the signal.

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,160
So this is the dendrite.

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,030
This right here is the soma.

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,390
Soma means body.

51
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,130
This is the body
of the neuron.

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,600
And then we have kind of a--
you can almost view it as a

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,100
tail of the neuron.

54
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,350
It's called the axon.

55
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,330

56
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,880
A neuron can be a reasonably
normal sized cell, although

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,820
there is a huge range, but the
axons can be quite long.

58
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,870
They could be short.

59
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,520
Sometimes in the brain you might
have very small axons,

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,610
but you might have axons that
go down the spinal column or

61
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,190
that go along one of your
limbs-- or if you're talking

62
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,240
about one of a dinosaur's
limbs.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,190
So the axon can actually
stretch several feet.

64
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,160
Not all neurons' axons
are several feet,

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,150
but they could be.

66
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,760
And this is really where a lot
of the distance of the signal

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,100
gets traveled.

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,190
Let me draw the axon.

69
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,620
So the axon will look
something like this.

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,080
And at the end, it ends at the
axon terminal where it can

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,360
connect to other dendrites or
maybe to other types of tissue

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,990
or muscle if the point of this
neuron is to tell a muscle to

73
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,910
do something.

74
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,810
So at the end of the axon,
you have the axon

75
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,070
terminal right there.

76
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,170
I'll do my best to draw
it like that.

77
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,830
Let me label it.

78
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,270
So this is the axon.

79
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,530
This is the axon terminal.

80
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,790

81
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,090
And you'll sometimes hear the
word-- the point at which the

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,590
soma or the body of the neuron
connects to the axon is as

83
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,400
often referred to as the axon
hillock-- maybe you can kind

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,380
of view it as kind of a lump.

85
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,690
It starts to form the axon.

86
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,740

87
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:54,610
And then we're going to talk
about how the impulses travel.

88
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,970
And a huge part in what allows
them to travel efficiently are

89
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,420
these insulating cells
around the axon.

90
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,760

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,520
We're going to talk about this
in detail and how they

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,230
actually work, but it's good
just to have the anatomical

93
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:17,420
structure first. So these are
called Schwann cells and

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,450
they're covering-- they make
up the myelin sheath.

95
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,040
So this covering, this
insulation, at different

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,850
intervals around the
axon, this is

97
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,710
called the myelin sheath.

98
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,540
So Schwann cells make up
the myelin sheath.

99
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,010
I'll do one more
just like that.

100
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:40,040

101
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,780
And then these little spaces
between the myelin sheath--

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,390
just so we have all of the
terminology from-- so we know

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,650
the entire anatomy of the
neuron-- these are called the

104
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,900
nodes of Ranvier.

105
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,620

106
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,950
I guess they're named
after Ranvier.

107
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,910
Maybe he was the guy who looked
and saw they had these

108
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,810
little slots here where you
don't have myelin sheath.

109
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,280
So these are the nodes
of Ranvier.

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,980
So the general idea, as I
mentioned, is that you get a

111
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,860
signal here.

112
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,070
We're going to talk more about
what the signal means-- and

113
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,890
then that signal gets--
actually, the signals can be

114
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,580
summed, so you might have one
little signal right there,

115
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,450
another signal right there, and
then you'll have maybe a

116
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,010
larger signal there and there--
and that the combined

117
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,780
effects of these signals get
summed up and they travel to

118
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,430
the hillock and if they're a
large enough, they're going to

119
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,940
trigger an action potential on
the axon, which will cause a

120
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,280
signal to travel down the
balance of the axon and then

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,920
over here it might be connected
via synapses to

122
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,440
other dendrites or muscles.

123
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,420
And we'll talk more about
synapses and those might help

124
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,790
trigger other things.

125
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,770
So you're saying, what's
triggering these things here?

126
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,400
Well, this could be the terminal
end of other neurons'

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,100
axons, like in the brain.

128
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,910
This could be some type
of sensory neuron.

129
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,490
This could be on a taste bud
someplace, so a salt molecule

130
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,280
somehow can trigger it or a
sugar molecule-- or this might

131
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,390
be some type of sensor.

132
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,110
It could be a whole bunch of
different things and we'll

133
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,700
talk more about the different
types of neurons.

134
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,950

1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:04,633
What I want to do in this video is review all the neat and bizarre things

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,955
that we have learned about triangles

3
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,916
so first we learned

4
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:12,138
So let me just draw a bunch of triangles for ourselves

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,508
so let's have a triangle right over there

6
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,974
the first thing that we talked about is

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,539
the perpendicular bisectors

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,059
of the sides of the triangles,

9
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:22,072
so if we take, so let's take

10
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:24,173
let's bisect this side over here,

11
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:26,805
and let's draw a perpendicular line to it,

12
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,173
so this line right over here would be

13
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:30,404
the perpendicular bisector of this side

14
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:32,091
right over here,

15
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,820
so it's bisecting and it's perpendicular, let's draw another

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,738
perpendicular bisector right over here,

17
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:38,273
so we're learning that this is the midpoint

18
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:42,927
of that side, let's draw a perpendicular bisector

19
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,506
and this length is equal to this length,

20
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:47,673
and then let's do one, let's do one

21
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,256
over here, this is the midpoint of that side

22
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:52,404
right over there, and then we will draw

23
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:56,005
a perpendicular - we know that this length

24
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,538
is equal to this length right over here,

25
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:02,253
and what we learned is where all these

26
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:04,673
perpendicular bisectors intersect,

27
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,135
what's neat about this and frankly,

28
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:07,358
all the things we're going to talk about

29
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,769
in this videos is

30
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,204
they do intersect in one unique point

31
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,921
that one unique point is equidistant from

32
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,672
the vertices of this triangle,

33
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:19,421
so this distance is going to be equal to

34
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:21,870
this distance, which is going to be

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,005
equal to that distance,

36
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:26,337
and because it's equidistant to the vertices,

37
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,071
you could draw a circle of that radius

38
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,534
that goes through the vertices, so

39
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,670
you could draw a circle of that radius

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,943
that goes through, that goes through

41
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:38,838
the vertices, and that's why we call this

42
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,338
right over here, that point,

43
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:43,003
that intersection of the perpendicular bisectors

44
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,980
let me write this down so we can keep track

45
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,937
of things, perpendicular bisectors,

46
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:51,922
perpendicular bisectors,

47
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:54,403
we call this point right over here our

48
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:58,172
circumcenter, because it is the center

49
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:02,204
of our circumcircle, a circle that can be

50
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:05,087
circumscribed about this triangle, so

51
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:10,505
this is our circumcircle.

52
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,588
And the radius of the circumcircle,

53
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,586
the distance between the circumcenter

54
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,589
and the vertices is the circumradius,

55
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:19,854
so that was the perpendicular bisectors.

56
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,458
Now the next thing we learn is

57
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,004
the whole point of this video is to

58
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,257
make sure we differentiate between these things

59
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,879
and not get too confused

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,736
let me draw another arbitrary triangle

61
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,723
right over here, the next thing we thought about

62
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:34,336
is, well, what about if we were to

63
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,490
bisect the angles?

64
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,754
Now, we're not talking about perpendicular bisecting

65
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,319
the sides, we're talking about

66
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,421
bisecting the angles themselves, so

67
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:46,005
we can bisect this angle right over here,

68
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,005
my best attempt to draw it-

69
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,737
so this angle is going to be equal to that angle,

70
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,622
we could bisect this angle right over here,

71
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:57,852
we could bisect- oh, that's - I could do a better version of that

72
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:01,870
so that looks- well, one more try.

73
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,525
So I could bisect it like that,

74
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:06,069
and then if I'm bisecting it,

75
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,969
this angle is going to be equal to that angle

76
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:12,421
and then if I bisect

77
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:16,736
this one, we know that this angle is going

78
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:19,581
to be equal to that angle over there,

79
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,837
and once again, we have proven to ourselves

80
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:24,071
that they all intersect in a

81
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,145
unique point, and this point,

82
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:28,403
instead of being equidistant from the vertices,

83
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:30,586
this point is equidistant from

84
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,895
the sides of the triangle,

85
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,387
so if you drop a perpendicular to

86
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:35,981
each of the sides, this distance is

87
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,671
going to be equal to that distance,

88
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,677
which is going to be equal to that distance,

89
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:42,789
and because of that, we can draw

90
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,350
a circle that is tangent to the side

91
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,255
that has this radius, we can draw a circle,

92
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,922
we can draw a circle

93
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:50,403
that looks like this,

94
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:51,608
and we call this circle, because

95
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,404
it's kind of inside the triangle

96
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:56,440
we call it an incircle, incircle,

97
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,320
and this point, we can call,

98
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,170
which is the intersection of

99
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,204
these angle bisectors, we can call this,

100
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:07,672
we can call this the in-radius,

101
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:10,755
now the other thing we learned about angle bisectors

102
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,671
and this was - we just have to draw one-

103
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:16,004
so let me just draw another triangle right over here,

104
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:17,733
and let me draw an angle bisector,

105
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,404
so I'm going to bisect this angle,

106
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:21,587
so this angle is equal to that angle,

107
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,722
and let me label some points here, so let's say that this is-

108
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,990
change the colors, let's say that is A,

109
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,361
this is B,this is C, and this is D,

110
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,344
we learned that if AC is really

111
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:38,587
the angle bisector of angle BAD,

112
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:43,818
that the ratio between AB over BC,

113
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,537
is going to be equal to the ratio

114
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:50,871
AD to DC, sometimes this is called

115
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:55,069
the angle bisector here, so that- that's neat

116
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,671
so the next thing we learned is - let's draw

117
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,736
another triangle here, this is to be a full review of everything

118
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,851
we've been covering in the last few videos-

119
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,004
so let me draw another triangle here-

120
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,320
so now, instead of drawing the perpendicular bisectors

121
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,802
let me label everything, this is angle bisectors,

122
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:13,755
this is angle bisectors,

123
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,505
and now what I'm going to think about are

124
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:19,392
the medians, the medians.

125
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:22,601
So the perpendicular bisectors were lines

126
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,266
that bisect the sides, and they are

127
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:28,203
perpendicular, but don't necessarily go through

128
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,470
the vertices. When we talk about medians,

129
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,870
we are talking about- we are talking about

130
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,071
points that bisect the sides, but

131
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:37,213
they go to the vertices, and they are not

132
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,737
necessarily perpendicular.

133
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,736
So let's draw some medians here. So let's say

134
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:45,189
this is the midpoint of that side right over there,

135
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,004
so we can draw the median like that,

136
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,736
notice it's going through the vertices,

137
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,304
these did not necessarily go through the vertices

138
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:54,398
this right over here is not necessarily perpendicular

139
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,875
but we do know that

140
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,257
this length is equal to that length right over there

141
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,403
and we draw a couple of more medians,

142
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,536
right over here, so this, the midpoint looks like

143
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:06,403
it's right about here, the midpoint looks

144
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:08,656
like it's right about there, so this length

145
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,837
is equal to that length, and notice it goes

146
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,919
through the vertex, but it's not necessarily perpendicular

147
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,469
and then this one,is a midpoint

148
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:19,424
looks like it's right about, well,

149
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,804
right about there,

150
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:22,671
and once again, all of these are concurrent,

151
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:24,507
they all intersect at one point right over here,

152
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,841
so this length right over here is equal to

153
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,172
this length right over here.

154
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,074
There is a bunch of neat things about medians-

155
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:32,473
when you draw the three medians

156
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:35,117
like this, that unique point where they intersect

157
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:38,474
we call this a centroid, centroid,

158
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:39,531
and as I mentioned, and you might learn this

159
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,074
later on in physics, is

160
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:45,193
if this was a uniform triangle, and it had

161
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:46,807
a uniform density, and if were to throw it

162
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,540
or rotate it in the air, it would

163
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,866
rotate around it's centroid,which is essentially-

164
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,842
it would essentially be its center of mass,

165
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:54,675
it would rotate around that as it's flying

166
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,036
through the air, if it had some type of

167
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,008
rotational or I guess you'd say

168
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,674
angular momentum, but the neat thing about this is

169
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:03,740
it also divides this triangle into

170
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,273
six triangles of equal area, so

171
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:09,213
this, this triangle has the same area as

172
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,898
that triangle, we proved this in several

173
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,467
videos ago, each of these 6 triangles all

174
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:16,188
have all have the same area.

175
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:20,083
The other thing that we learned about medians is that

176
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,605
where the centroid sits on each

177
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:26,365
of the medians is two thirds along the median,

178
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,984
so the ratio of this side of this length

179
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,801
to this length is two to one, or this is

180
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,890
two thirds along the way of the median-

181
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,401
this is two thirds of the median, this is

182
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,801
one third of the median, so the ratio is

183
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,333
two to one.

184
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,867
Another related thing we learned,

185
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,068
this wasn't necessarily about medians,

186
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:45,800
but a related concept, was the idea of

187
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,819
medial triangle, a medial triangle like this,

188
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,867
where you take the midpoint of each side

189
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,151
the midpoint of each side, and you draw

190
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:58,851
a triangle that connects the midpoints of each side,

191
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,068
we call this triangle a medial triangle,

192
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:03,334
a medial triangle, and we've proved to ourselves

193
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,949
that this- when you draw a medial triangle,

194
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,272
it separates this triangle into four triangles

195
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:10,837
that not only have equal area, but

196
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,478
the four triangles here are actually, they are actually

197
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,928
congruent triangles, and not only are they

198
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,711
congruent, but we've shown that this side

199
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,511
is parallel to this side,that's what we do,

200
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:22,762
use some more colors here,

201
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,078
this side is parallel - actually, I should

202
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,118
draw two arrows like that, that side is

203
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:29,744
parallel to that side,this side is

204
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,960
parallel to this side, and then you have

205
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,824
this side is parallel to this side right here,

206
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:38,429
and this length is half that length,

207
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,678
this length is half of that length, and

208
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:42,143
it really just comes out of the fact that

209
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:45,908
these are four congruent triangles.

210
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,844
There's a last thing that we touched on is

211
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,296
drawing altitudes of a triangle, so

212
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,817
there's medians, medial triangles,and

213
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:54,918
I'll draw one last triangle over here, and here

214
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,545
I'm going to go from each of the vertex,

215
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:58,844
and I'm not going to go to the midpoint

216
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,922
I'm going to drop a perpendicular to the

217
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:04,344
other side. So here I will drop a perpendicular

218
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,143
but this isn't necessarily bisecting the other side,

219
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:09,594
once again, we're going to drop a perpendicular

220
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:12,171
but not necessarily bisecting the other side,

221
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:15,871
and then drop a perpendicular but not necessarily bisecting the other side

222
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,302
and we have also proven to ourselves that

223
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:20,336
these are the altitudes of the triangle,

224
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:22,752
altitudes of the triangle, and

225
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:26,303
these also intersect in a unique- these also

226
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,377
intersect in a unique point.

227
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:30,386
And I want to be clear, this unique point

228
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,951
does not necessarily have to be inside

229
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,802
of the triangle. The same thing was true of

230
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,637
the perpendicular bisectors, it actually could

231
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,119
be outside of the triangle, and this

232
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:43,670
unique point we call an ortho, orthocenter.

233
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,601
So I'll leave you there, and hopefully this is

234
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,796
useful, cause I know it can get confusing,

235
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,219
you know, how's a median different than a

236
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,535
circumcenter, which is different than an

237
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:53,361
orthocenter, or inrays, or any of these type

238
00:09:53,361 --> 99:59:59,999
of things, so hopefully, this clarifies things a little bit.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,500
Based on the examples
in the last video,

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,180
let's see if we can come
up with some rules of thumb

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,760
for figuring out how
many significant figures

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,260
or how many significant
digits there

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,350
are in a number
or a measurement.

7
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,140
So the first thing
that is pretty obvious

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,140
is that any non-zero
digit and any

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,720
of the zero digits in
between are significant.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,930
Clearly, the 7 and the
5 here are significant.

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,550
And the 0 in between them, it's
also going to be significant.

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,900
So let's write this over here.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:37,940
So any non-zero digits
and zeros in between

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,020
are going to be significant.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,170
That's pretty straightforward.

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,680
Now, the zeros that are not in
between nonzero digits, these

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,610
become a little
bit more confusing.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,740
So let's just make sure we
can rule out some of them.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,730
So you can always rule out
when you're thinking about

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,272
significant figures,
the leading 0's.

21
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:58,980
And when I'm talking
about leading zeros,

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,910
I'm talking about
the zeros that come

23
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,720
before your non-zero digit.

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,670
So these are
leading zeroes here.

25
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,220
These are leading zeroes.

26
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,061
There is no leading zeroes here.

27
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,310
No leading zeroes in this
one, this one, and this one.

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,200
But in any situation,
the leading zeros

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,960
are not significant.

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,830
So leading zeros
not significant,

31
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,830
I'll write it over here.

32
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:26,180
Leading zeros not significant.

33
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,320
And so the last question,
all you have left,

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,389
I mean you only have non-zero
digits and zeros in between.

35
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:33,680
You could have some leading
zeros, which you've already

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,020
said are not significant.

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,269
And so the only thing left
that you have to figure out

38
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,440
is what do you do with the
trailing zeroes, the zeroes

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,450
behind the last
non-zero, or to the right

40
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,820
of the last non-zero digit.

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,680
So these trailing zeroes here.

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,090
There's actually two
trailing zeroes over here.

43
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,490
And then there's three
trailing zeroes over here.

44
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,365
So let me make a little--
so trailing zeroes.

45
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:00,790

46
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,066
Trailing zeroes, what
do we do with them?

47
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,440
So the easy way
to think about is

48
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,490
if you have a decimal, if
there's a decimal anywhere

49
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,550
in your number, count them.

50
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,550
If you have a
decimal, count them.

51
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,560
Count them as significant.

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,790
They are significant,
count them as significant.

53
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,790
If there's no decimal
anywhere in the number,

54
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,810
then it's kind of ambiguous.

55
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,190
You're kind of not sure
and this is a situation.

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,980
So clearly over here, there's
a decimal in the number,

57
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,560
so you count the
trailing zeroes.

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,540
These are adding
to the precision.

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,950
Over here there's a decimal,
so you count the trailing zero.

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,580
There's a decimal here, so
you count the trailing zeroes.

61
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,440
There are no
trailing zeroes here.

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,960
And over here-- well, the way
I later put a decimal here.

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,450
Here you would count it.

64
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,940
So if you have
the decimal there,

65
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,460
you would count all five.

66
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,640
If you didn't have the
decimal, if you just

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,650
had 37,000 like
that, it's ambiguous.

68
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,420
And if someone doesn't
give you more information,

69
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,800
your best assumption is
probably that they just

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,779
measured to the
nearest thousand.

71
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:10,820
That they didn't measure
exactly the one and just

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,610
happened to get
exactly on 37,000.

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,910
So if there's no
decimal, let me write

74
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,820
it this way-- it's
ambiguous, which

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,590
means that you're not
sure what it means,

76
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,820
it's not clear what it means.

77
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,755
And you're probably safer
assuming to not count it.

78
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:35,769

79
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,310
If someone really does measure,
if you were to really measure

80
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,610
something to the
exact one, then you

81
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,810
should put a decimal
at the end like that.

82
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,970
And there is a notation
for specifying.

83
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,970
Let's say you do measure-- and
let me do a different number.

84
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,270
Let's say you do measure 56,000.

85
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,630
And there is a notation for
specifying that 6 definitely

86
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,360
is the last significant digit.

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,990
And sometimes you'll see
a bar put over the 6,

88
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,740
sometimes you'll see
a bar put under the 6.

89
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,440
And that could be
useful because maybe

90
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,980
your last significant digit
is this zero over here.

91
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,030
Maybe you were able to
measure to the hundreds

92
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,930
with a reasonable
level of precision.

93
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,250
And so then you would write
something like 56,000,

94
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,710
but then you would put
the bar above that zero,

95
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,540
or the bar below
that zero to say

96
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,804
that that was the last
significant digit.

97
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:28,220
So if you saw
something like this,

98
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,910
you would say three
significant digits.

99
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,170
This isn't used so frequently.

100
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,850
A better way to show
that you've measured

101
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,800
to three significant
digits would

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,001
be to write it in
scientific notation.

103
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,250
There's a whole video on that.

104
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,540
But to write this in
scientific notation,

105
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:51,800
you could write this as 5.60
times 10 to the fourth power.

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,397
Because if you multiply
this times to the fourth,

107
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:57,230
you would move this
decimal over four spaces

108
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,630
and get us to 56,000.

109
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,372
So 5.60 times 10 to the fourth.

110
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,080
And if this confuses
you, watch the video

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,310
on scientific notation.

112
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,640
It will hopefully clarify
things a little bit.

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,300
But when you write a number
in scientific notation,

114
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,440
it makes it very clear
about your precision

115
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,760
and how many significant
digits you're dealing with.

116
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,426
So instead of doing
this notation that's

117
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,700
a little bit outdated-- I
haven't seen it used much

118
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,170
with these bars below or above
the high significant digit,

119
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,080
instead you could
represent it with a decimal

120
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,970
in scientific notation.

121
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,540
And there it's
very clear that you

122
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,797
have three significant digits.

123
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,130
So hopefully that helps you out.

124
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,380
In the next couple of videos,
we'll explore a little bit more

125
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,870
why significant digits are
important, especially when you

126
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,010
do calculations with
multiple measurements.

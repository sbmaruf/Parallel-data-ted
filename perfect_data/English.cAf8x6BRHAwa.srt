1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,940
Solve the following application
problem using three equations

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,510
with three unknowns.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,540
And they tell us the
second angle of a triangle

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,910
is 50 degrees less than
four times the first angle.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,200
The third angle is 40
degrees less than the first.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,090
Find the measures
of the three angles.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,280
So let's draw ourselves
a triangle here.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,300
And let's call the first angle
a, the second angle b, and then

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,080
the third angle c.

10
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:29,946
And before we even look
at these constraints,

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,990
one property we
know of triangles

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,200
is that the sum of their
angles must be 180 degrees.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,470
So we know that a plus b plus
c must be equal to 180 degrees.

14
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:44,182
Now, with that out of
the way, let's look

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,400
at these other constraints.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,530
So they tell us the second
angle of a triangle--

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,650
let me do that in
another color--

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,750
they tell us the second
angle of a triangle

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,370
is 50 degrees less than
four times the first angle.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,440
So we're saying b
is the second angle.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,840
So they're saying, the
second angle of a triangle

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,730
is 50 degrees less than
four times the first angle.

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,850
So 4 times the first
angle would be 4a,

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,040
we're calling a the first angle.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,780
So 4 times the
first angle is 4a.

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,770
But it's 50 degrees less
than that, so minus 50.

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,670
Now the next constraint they
give us, the third angle

28
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,250
is 40 degrees less
than the first.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,970
So the third angle is 40
degrees less than the first.

30
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,070
So the first angle, a, is
going to be 40 degrees less

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,590
than that.

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,930
So we have three equations
with three unknowns.

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,830
And so we just have
to solve for it.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,320
And let's see, what's a
good first variable to try

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,270
to eliminate?

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,940
And just to try to visualize
that a little bit better,

37
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,990
I'm going to bring these a's
onto the left hand side of each

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,820
of these equations over here.

39
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,840
So I'm going to rewrite
the first equation.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,950
We have a plus b plus
c is equal to 180.

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,340
And then this equation,
if we subtract 4a

42
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,920
from both sides of this
equation, if we subtract 4a

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:16,670
we have negative 4a plus
b is equal to negative 50.

44
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,630
And then this equation
right over here,

45
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,400
if we subtract a
from both sides we

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:33,620
get negative a plus c
is equal to negative 40.

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,280
I just subtract a
from both sides.

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,600
So we now want to
eliminate variables.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,340
And we already have--
this third equation

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,750
here is only in
terms of a and c.

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,480
This is only in
terms of a and b.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,850
And this first one is
in terms of a, b, and c.

53
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,240
So if we could-- let's see, this
is already in terms of a and c.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
If we could turn these
first two equations,

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,580
if we can use the information
in these first two equations

56
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,250
to end up with an
equation that's

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,380
only in terms of
a and c, then we

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,510
could use whatever
we end up with along

59
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,770
with this third equation
right over here,

60
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,690
and we'll have a system of two
equations with two unknowns.

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,520
So let's do that.

62
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,059
So if we wanted to just end up
with an equation only in terms

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,180
of a and c using
these first two,

64
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,010
we would want to
eliminate the b's.

65
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,799
So we could multiply
one of these equations

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,970
times negative 1, and one
of these positive b's will

67
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,106
turn into a negative b.

68
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,950
So let's do that.

69
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,560
Let's multiply this first
equation over here, let's

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,350
multiply it times negative 1.

71
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,020
So it'll become
negative a minus b

72
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,280
minus c is equal
to negative 180.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,100
And then we have this
green equation right

74
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,990
over here, which is really just
this equation, just rearranged.

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,600
So we have negative 4a plus
b is equal to negative 50.

76
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,930
And now we can add
these two equations.

77
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,757
Actually, let me do
that in the other color,

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,060
just so you see where
that's coming from.

79
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:55,056
I'll do it in that green color.

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,160
So this is negative 4a plus
b is equal to negative 50.

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,620
We can add these two up now.

82
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,370
And we get negative a
minus 4a is negative 5a.

83
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,030
The b's cancel out.

84
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,280
We have a minus c is equal
to negative 180 minus 50

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,599
is negative 230.

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,260
So now using these
top two equations

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,360
we have an equation only
in terms of a and c.

88
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:24,437
We have another equation
only in terms of a and c.

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,210
And it looks like if we
add them together their c's

90
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,020
will cancel out.

91
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,010
So let me just rewrite
this equation over here.

92
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,587
And you have to be
careful that you're

93
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,720
using all of the equations.

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,950
Otherwise you'll do
a circular argument.

95
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,460
You have to be careful that over
here this first equation came

96
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,430
from these two over here.

97
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,250
Now I want to combine that
with this third constraint,

98
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,270
s constraint that's not already
baked into this equation

99
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,980
right over here.

100
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,320
So we have negative a plus
c is equal to negative 40.

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
And we add these two equations.

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
Negative 5a minus
a is negative 6a.

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,740
The c's cancel out.

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,530
And then you have
negative 230 minus 40.

105
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,190
This is equal to negative 270.

106
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,080
We can divide both
sides by negative 6.

107
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,550
And we get a is equal
to negative 270 over 6.

108
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,630
Let me see how many times--
let me see something.

109
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,110
270 is divisible
by both 3 and 2.

110
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,870
So it should be divisible by 6.

111
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,350
So let me just divide it.

112
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,280
The negative signs
obviously will-- a negative

113
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
divided by a negative is
going to be a positive.

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,210
And if we take 6 into 270,
6 goes into 27 4 times.

115
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,420
4 times 6 is 24.

116
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,670
We subtract.

117
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,670
We get 3, bring down the 0.

118
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,970
6 goes into 30 five times.

119
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,730
So we get a is equal to 45.

120
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,105
Now let's look at
the other ones.

121
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,320
We can substitute back
in to solve for c.

122
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:58,926
c is equal to a
minus 40 degrees.

123
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,270
So that is equal to-- let
me write it right over

124
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,320
here in yellow-- so c
is equal to 45 minus 40,

125
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,020
which is equal to 5 degrees.

126
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,490
So, so far we have a
is equal to 45 degrees,

127
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,740
c is equal to 5 degrees.

128
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,696
And then you could
substitute into either one

129
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,470
of these other ones
to figure out b.

130
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,730
We could use this one
right over here in green.

131
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,170
B is equal to 4a minus 50.

132
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,310
So b is going to be equal to
4 times 45 is-- let's see,

133
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,580
2 times 45 is 90.

134
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,110
So 4 times 45 is 180.

135
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,680
So it's going to
be 180 minus 50,

136
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,840
by this equation
right over here, which

137
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,110
is equal to 130 degrees.

138
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,340
So we get b is equal
to 130 degrees.

139
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,052
And then we can-- let
me write over here.

140
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,330
So a is equal to 45.

141
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,780
So if I wanted to
draw this triangle

142
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,870
it would actually look
something like this.

143
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,150
a is a 45 degree angle, b is a
130 degree angle, and c is 5.

144
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,150
So it'll look
something like this.

145
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,570
It will look
something like this,

146
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,370
where this is a at 45
degrees, b is 135 degrees,

147
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,030
and then c is 5 degrees.

148
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,680
And you can verify
that it works.

149
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,210
One, you can just
add up the angles.

150
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,310
45 plus 5 is 50.

151
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh, sorry, this isn't 135.

152
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,380
It's 130.

153
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,592
We solved it right over here.

154
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,630
It's 130 and this is 5.

155
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,530
So when you add them
all up-- 45 plus 130

156
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,830
plus 5-- that does
indeed equal 180 degrees.

157
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,440
45 plus 5 is 50 plus 130.

158
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,150
So this does
definitely equal 180.

159
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,010
So it meets our
first constraint,

160
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,050
Then on our second
constraint, b needs

161
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,040
to be equal to 4a minus 50.

162
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,880
Well, 4 times a is 180
minus 50 is 130 degrees.

163
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,860
So it meets our
second constraint.

164
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,780
And then our third constraint,
c is a minus 40 degrees.

165
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, a is 45, c is 5.

166
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,890

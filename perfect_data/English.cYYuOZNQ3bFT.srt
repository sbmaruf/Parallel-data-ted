1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,790
The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning…I get on my computer, and I open

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,480
up Google. That’s my homepage, and that’s where I start.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,549
I type in ‘Weather,’ ‘Cincinnati,’ and it comes up instantly.

4
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:16,379
The first thing I do is check out the 49ers. The Bears.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,220
The Cowboys! The Saints.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,960
I’m following the presidential race, and ‘Narrowing by Time’ keeps me up to date,

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,259
fast.

8
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:26,960
I just type in what movie and my zip code, and it’ll pop up. There’s this theater,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,089
with this time. It’s so fast.

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:34,480
My mind still works in Celsius sometimes. It’s really helpful for us to have the conversion

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,360
function.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,820
I use the calculator a lot. I’m constantly giving out price quotes.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,550
I’m always putting in, like, how many ounces are in a cup. Or, you know, things like that.

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,780
I like to try new restaurants. Finding it on Google is really easily done.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,430
We found a number of recipes that use pineapples. Maddy doesn’t like raisins, so we actually

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,880
de-selected the recipes with raisins…so what came up were foods that the kids liked.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,440
I always come back to my tried and true Google.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,890
I like to use the Google Voice function to do my searches. There’s a little thing that

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,220
looks like a microphone…so I’ll press that and then just speak right into it

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,960
"Waikiki Beach."

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,110
It comes up with a search just like you would get when you type something in.

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,510
I saw this plant that I really, really loved. And we took a picture, and we were able to

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,159
figure out what it was. So it’s now on our balcony.

24
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,480
I use Google Search to search by subject. Getting black and white pictures instead of

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,420
just colored photos

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,270
Google can make you look like a genius.

27
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,440
Google makes things so easy.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,060
Now if Google could just make my son eat his vegetables...

29
00:01:37,060 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s truly amazing.

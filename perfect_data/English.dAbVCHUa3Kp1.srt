1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,240
I have three word problems here.

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,890
And what I want to
do in this video

4
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,310
is not solve the word problems
but just set up the equation

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,990
that we could solve to get the
answer to the word problems.

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,865
And essentially, we're
going to be setting up

7
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:13,670
proportions in either case.

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,350
So in this first problem, we
have 9 markers cost $11.50.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,140
And then they ask us, how
much would 7 markers cost?

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,820
And let's just set x to
be equal to our answer.

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,310
So x is equal to the
cost of 7 markers.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,476

13
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,100
So the way to solve
a problem like this

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,050
is to set up two ratios and then
set them equal to each other.

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,910
So you could say that the ratio
of 9 markers to the cost of 9

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,720
markers, so the ratio of
the number of markers, so 9,

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,740
to the cost of the
9 markers, to 11.50,

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,580
this should be equal to
the ratio of our new number

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:04,849
of markers, 7, to whatever
the cost of the 7 markers are,

20
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,850
to x.

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,970
Let me do x in green.

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,560

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,500
So this is a completely
valid proportion here.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,870
The ratio of 9 markers
to the cost of 9 markers

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,309
is equal to 7 markers to
the cost of 7 markers.

26
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:22,100
And then you could
solve this to figure out

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,967
how much those 7
markers would cost.

28
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,550
And you could flip
both sides of this,

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,780
and it would still be a
completely valid ratio.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,595
You could have 11.50 to 9.

31
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,570
The ratio between the cost
of the markers to the number

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:47,830
of markers you're
buying, 11.50 to 9,

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,300
is equal to the ratio of the
cost of 7 markers to the number

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,100
of markers, which
is obviously 7.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,470
So all I would do is flip
both sides of this equation

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,220
right here to get
this one over here.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,820
You could also think about
the ratios in other ways.

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:11,380
You could say that the ratio
of 9 markers to 7 markers

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,360
is going to be the same as
the ratio of their costs,

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,080
is going to be equal to the
ratio of the cost of 9 markers

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,120
to the cost of 7 markers.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,000
And then, obviously, you could
flip both of these sides.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,895

44
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:30,580
Let me do that in the
same magenta color.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,880
The ratio of 7
markers to 9 markers

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,790
is the same thing as
the ratio of the cost

47
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,060
of 7 markers to the
cost of 9 markers.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,340
So that is 11.50.

49
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,140
So all of these would be valid
proportions, valid equations

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,840
that describe what's
going on here.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,729
And then you would just have
to essentially solve for x.

52
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,270
So let's do this
one right over here.

53
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,740
7 apples cost $5.

54
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,620
How many apples can
I buy it with $8?

55
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,720
So one again, we're going to
assume that what they're asking

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,620
is how many apples--
let's call that x.

57
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,950
x is what we want to solve for.

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,980
So 7 apples costs $5.

59
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,790
So we have the ratio between
the number of apples, 7,

60
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,470
and the cost of
the apples, 5, is

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,520
going to be equal to the
ratio between another number

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,380
of apples, which is now x, and
the cost of that other number

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,490
of apples.

64
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,200
And it's going to be $8.

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,310
And so notice here in this first
situation, what was unknown

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,300
was the cost.

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,000
So we kind of had
the number of apples

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,220
to cost, the number
of apples to cost.

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,825
Now in this example, the
unknown is the number of apples,

70
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,975
so number of apples to cost,
number of apples to cost.

71
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,350
And we could do all of the
different scenarios like this.

72
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,610
You could also say the
ratio between 7 apples

73
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,320
and x apples is
going to be the same

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,110
as the ratio between
the cost of 7 apples

75
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,870
and the cost of 8 apples.

76
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,390
Obviously, you can
flip both sides

77
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,430
of these in either
of these equations

78
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,530
to get two more equations.

79
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,056
And any of these would
be valid equations.

80
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:16,180
Now let's do this last one.

81
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,775

82
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,320
I'll use new colors here.

83
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,140
A cake recipe for 5
people requires 2 eggs.

84
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,180

85
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,935
So we want to know how many
eggs-- so this we'll call x.

86
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:34,560
And you don't always
have to call it x.

87
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,650
You could call it e for eggs.

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,608
Well, e isn't a good
idea, because e represents

89
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,360
another number once you
get to higher mathematics.

90
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,680
But you could call them y
or z or any variable-- a,

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,900
b, or c, anything.

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,650
How many eggs do we need
for a 15-person cake?

93
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,580

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,620
So you could say the ratio of
people to eggs is constant.

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:06,740
So if we have 5 people for
2 eggs, then for 15 people,

96
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,530
we are going to need x eggs.

97
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,730
This ratio is going
to be constant.

98
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,880
5/2 is equal to 15/x.

99
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,670
Or you could flip
both sides of this.

100
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:21,320
Or you could say the
ratio between 5 and 15

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,580
is going to be equal to the
ratio between the number

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:33,420
of eggs for 5 people-- let me
do that in that blue color--

103
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,330
and the number of
eggs for 15 people.

104
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,320
And obviously, you could flip
both sides of this equation.

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,820
So all of these,
we've essentially

106
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,650
set up the proportions
that describe

107
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,460
each of these problems.

108
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,170
And then you can
go later and solve

109
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,980
for x to actually
get the answer.

1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
'Ala habibika khayril khalqi kullihimi (Upon Your beloved, the best of the entire creation)

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
All the poetry ever written

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Every verse and every line

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All the love songs in the world

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And every melody and rhyme

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If they were combined

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They would still be unable to express

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What I want to define

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When I try to describe my love for you

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
'Ala habibika khayril khalqi kullihimi (Upon Your beloved, the best of the entire creation)

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
'Ala habibika khayril khalqi kullihimi (Upon Your beloved, the best of the entire creation)

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ya Rabbee salli 'aleeh (My Lord send Your peace upon him)

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Salawatu Allahi 'aleeh (May Allah's salutations be upon him)

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Every sound and every voice

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In every language ever heard

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Each drop of ink that has been used

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
To write every single word

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They could never portray

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Everything I feel in my heart and want to say

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And it’s hard to explain

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why I could never describe my love for you

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Salawatu Allahi 'aleeh (May Allah's salutations be upon him)

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There’s not a single person

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Who can ever match his worth

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In character and beauty

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
To ever walk on earth

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I envy every rock and tree

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And every grain of sand

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That embraced his noble feet

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Or that kissed his blessed hands

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ya Rasool Allah (O Messenger of Allah)

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ya Habiba Allah (O Allah's Beloved)

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Grant us the chance to be with him

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We pray to You Allah

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Mawlaya salli wa sallim da'iman abadan (My Lord send Your peace and blessings always and forever)

50

'Ala habibika khayril khalqi kullihimi (Upon Your beloved, the best of the entire creation)

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ya Rabbee salli 'aleeh (My Lord send Your peace upon him)

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Salawatu Allahi 'aleeh (May Allah's salutations be upon him)

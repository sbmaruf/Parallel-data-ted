1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,470
I want to do a quick
argument, or proof,

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,270
as to why the diagonals of
a rhombus are perpendicular.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,000
So remember, a rhombus
is just a parallelogram

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,200
where all four sides are equal.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,370
In fact, if all four
sides are equal,

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,550
it has to be a parallelogram.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,410
And just to make things
clear, some rhombuses

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,930
are squares, but
not all of them.

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,680
Because you could have
a rhombus like this

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,580
that comes in where the
angles aren't 90 degrees.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,457
But all squares are rhombuses,
because all squares,

13
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:30,790
they have 90-degree angles here.

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,320
That's not what makes them a
rhombus, but all of the sides

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,080
are equal.

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,660
So all squares are rhombuses,
but not all rhombuses

17
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,265
are squares.

18
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,390
Now with that said, let's
think about the diagonals

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,370
of a rhombus.

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,850
And to think about that
a little bit clearer,

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,577
I'm going to draw the rhombus
really as kind of-- I'm

22
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,160
gonna rotate a little
bit, so it looks

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,270
a little bit like
a diamond shape.

24
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,710
So notice I'm not
really changing

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,600
any of the properties
of the rhombus.

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,770
I'm just drawing it,
I'm just changing

27
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,130
its orientation a little bit.

28
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm just changing
its orientation.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,800
So a rhombus by
definition, the four sides

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,840
are going to be equal.

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,440
Now, let me draw one
of its diagonals.

32
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,450
And the way I drew it right
here is kind of a diamond.

33
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,200
One of its diagonals will be
right along the horizontal,

34
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,720
right like that.

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,650
Now, this triangle on
the top and the triangle

36
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,289
on the bottom both share
this side, so that side

37
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,330
is obviously going to be
the same length for both

38
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,376
of these triangles.

39
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:25,250
And then the other two
sides of the triangles

40
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,400
are also the same thing.

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,350
They're sides of
the actual rhombus.

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,520
So all three sides
of this top triangle

43
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,300
and this bottom
triangle are the same.

44
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,610
So this top triangle and this
bottom triangle are congruent.

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,140
They are congruent triangles.

46
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,940
If you go back to your
ninth grade geometry,

47
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,590
you'd use the side-side-side
theorem to prove that.

48
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,410
Three sides are congruent,
then the triangles themselves

49
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,089
are congruent.

50
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:50,380
But that also means that all
the angles in the triangle

51
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,150
are congruent.

52
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,120
So the angle that is opposite
this side, this shared side

53
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,680
right over here
will be congruent

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,110
to the corresponding angle in
the other triangle, the angle

55
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,190
opposite this side.

56
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,620
So it would be the
same thing as that.

57
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,870
Now, both of these triangles
are also isosceles triangles,

58
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,170
so their base angles are
going to be the same.

59
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,900
So that's one base angle, that's
the other base angle, right?

60
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,810
This is an upside down
isosceles triangle,

61
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,440
this is a right side up one.

62
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,080
And so if these
two are the same,

63
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,059
then these are also
going to be the same.

64
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,850
They're going to be
the same to each other,

65
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,467
because this is an
isosceles triangle.

66
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,800
And they're also going to be
the same as these other two

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,860
characters down here, because
these are congruent triangles.

68
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,160
Now, if we take an altitude,
and actually, I didn't even

69
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,130
have to talk about
that, since actually,

70
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,220
I don't think that'll be
relevant when we actually

71
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,720
want to prove what
we want to prove.

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,970
If we take an altitude
from each of these

73
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,880
vertices down to this
side right over here.

74
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,230
So an altitude by
definition is going

75
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,840
to be perpendicular down here.

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,610
Now, an isosceles triangle
is perfectly symmetrical.

77
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,002
If you drop an
altitude from the-- I

78
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,210
guess you could call it the
top, or the unique angle,

79
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,550
or the unique vertex in
an isosceles triangle--

80
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,080
you will split it into two
symmetric right triangles.

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,050
Two right triangles
that are essentially the

82
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,880
mirror images of each other.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,600

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,080
You will also bisect
the opposite side.

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,310
This altitude is, in fact,
a median of the triangle.

86
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,260
Now we could do it
on the other side.

87
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,990
The same exact thing
is going to happen.

88
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,420

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,210
We are bisecting
this side over here.

90
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,634
This is a right angle.

91
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,050
And so essentially
the combination

92
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,360
of these two altitudes
is really just a diagonal

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,590
of this rhombus.

94
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,770
And it's at a right angle to the
other diagonal of the rhombus.

95
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,484
And it bisects that other
diagonal of the rhombus.

96
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:53,650
And we could make the exact
same argument over here.

97
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,510
You could think of an
isosceles triangle over here.

98
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,480
This is an altitude of it.

99
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,630
It splits it into two
symmetric right triangles.

100
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,750
It bisects the opposite side.

101
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,840
It's essentially a
median of that triangle.

102
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,540
Any isosceles triangle.

103
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,560
Any isosceles triangle, if
that side's equal to that side,

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,324
if you drop an altitude,
these two triangles

105
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,740
are going to be
symmetric, and you

106
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,790
will have bisected
the opposite side.

107
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,470
So by the same argument, that
side's equal to that side,

108
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,700
so the two diagonals
of any rhombus

109
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,360
are perpendicular to each other
and they bisect each other.

110
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,950

111
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,830
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

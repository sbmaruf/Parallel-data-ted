1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
Find the area and
perimeter of the polygon.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,770
So let's start with
the area first.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,580
So the area of this
polygon-- there's

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,980
kind of two parts of this.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,580
First, you have this part
that's kind of rectangular,

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,980
or it is rectangular,
this part right over here.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,710
And that area is
pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,140
It's just going to
be base times height.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,490
So area's going to be 8 times
4 for the rectangular part.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,050
And then we have this
triangular part up here.

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,410
So we have this area up here.

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,070
And for a triangle, the area
is base times height times 1/2.

13
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,695
And that actually
makes a lot of sense.

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,890
Because if you just
multiplied base times height,

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,020
you would get this entire area.

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,190
You would get the area
of that entire rectangle.

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,400
And you see that the triangle
is exactly 1/2 of it.

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,939
If you took this
part of the triangle

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,100
and you flipped it over,
you'd fill up that space.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,640
If you took this
part of the triangle

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,771
and you flipped it over,
you'd fill up that space.

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,280
So the triangle's area is
1/2 of the triangle's base

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,940
times the triangle's height.

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,400
So plus 1/2 times
the triangle's base,

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,570
which is 8 inches, times
the triangle's height, which

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,619
is 4 inches.

27
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,440
And so let's just calculate it.

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,710
This gives us 32
plus-- oh, sorry.

29
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,780
That's not 8 times 4.

30
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:15,954
I don't want to confuse you.

31
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,260
The triangle's height is 3.

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,160
8 times 3, right there.

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,740
That's the triangle's height.

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,270
So once again, let's go
back and calculate it.

35
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,460
So this is going to be 32
plus-- 1/2 times 8 is 4.

36
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:33,905
4 times 3 is 12.

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,030
And so our area for our
shape is going to be 44.

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,380
Now let's do the perimeter.

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,560
The perimeter-- we just
have to figure out what's

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,130
the sum of the sides.

41
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,505
How long of a
fence would we have

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,000
to build if we wanted to make
it around this shape, right

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
along the sides of this shape?

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,210
So the perimeter-- I'll
just write P for perimeter.

45
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:05,260
It's going to be equal to 8 plus
4 plus 5 plus this 5, this edge

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,350
right over here, plus--
I didn't write that down.

47
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,300
So I have two 5's plus
this 4 right over here.

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,540
So you have 8 plus 4 is 12.

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,630
12 plus 10-- well, I'll
just go one step at a time.

50
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,960
12 plus 5 is 17.

51
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:23,686
17 plus 5 is 22.

52
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:26,744
22 plus 4 is 26.

53
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,940
So the perimeter is 26 inches.

54
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,670
And let me get the
units right, too.

55
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,440
Because over here, I'm
multiplying 8 inches

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,530
by 4 inches.

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,260
So you get square inches.

58
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,240
8 inches by 3 inches, so
you get square inches again.

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,980
So this is going to
be square inches.

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,960
So area is 44 square inches.

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,840
Perimeter is 26 inches.

62
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:47,206
And that makes
sense because this

63
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,580
is a two-dimensional
measurement.

64
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,904
It's measuring something
in two-dimensional space,

65
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,490
so you get a
two-dimensional unit.

66
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,120
This is a one-dimensional
measurement.

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,710
It's only asking you,
essentially, how long would

68
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,520
a string have to be to
go around this thing.

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,560
And so that's why you get
one-dimensional units.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,890
All right, I have
a problem here.

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,840
Jacob and Emily ride a
ferris wheel at a carnival

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,290
in Billings, Montana.

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,280
The wheel has a
16-meter diameter.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,440
So let me draw the wheel.

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,110
It has a 16-meter diameter.

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,225
So let me draw it big.

9
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,886
Give me a lot of space.

10
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:20,910
So it has a 16-meter
diameter, so what's its

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,710
radius going to be?

12
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,570
Its radius is going to
be half of that, right?

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:33,280
So if I were to draw its
radius, just draw it like that.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,370

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,780
It's a 16-meter diameter, so
it's radius is going to be 8

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,390
meters with its lowest point
above the ground-- oh,

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,540
with its lowest point 1
meter above the ground.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,690
So its lowest point
is right here.

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,580
This is its lowest point,
and that is 1 meter

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,270
above the ground.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,920
So this distance right
here is 1 meter.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,570
Fair enough.

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,180

24
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,335
Assume that Jacob and Emily's
height h above the ground is a

25
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:10,100
sinusoidal function of time
where t equals 0 represents the

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,700
lowest point on the wheel.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,720
So this is at point t equals 0
right here. t equals 0 is the

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,860
lowest point of the wheel.

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,440
Write an equation for h.

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,060
Oh, I think I forgot,
so let me reread it.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,490
Jacob and Emily ride a
ferris wheel at a carnival

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,170
in Billings, Montana.

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,030
The wheel has a 16-meter
diameter-- we did

34
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,450
that-- and turns at 3
revolutions per minute.

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,910
So it turns at 3 revolutions
per minute with its lowest

36
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,570
point 1 meter above the ground.

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,790
Assume that Jacob and Emily's
height h above the ground is

38
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,250
a sinusoidal function of
time, where t equals 0.

39
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,160
So we need to write a function
of h, their distance above the

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,200
ground, as a function of time,
and they're saying that

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
time is given in seconds.

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,860
So, first of all, they're
telling us 3 revolutions

43
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,760
every minute, right?

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:03,950
So that's 3 revolutions per
60 seconds, and that's the

45
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,500
same thing as 1 revolution
per 20 seconds, right?

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,630
I just divide both sides of
the per by 3 for 20 seconds.

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,710
And one revolution is
how many degrees?

48
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,840
One revolution is 360 degrees.

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:27,420
So it's 360 degrees
per 20 seconds.

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,280
And if you're going 360 degrees
per 20 seconds, let's divide--

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,980
you know, the per you can just
kind of use as an equal

52
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,270
sign of the equation.

53
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,180
360 degrees for 20 seconds.

54
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,270
That means you're
going to go what?

55
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,740
18 degrees, Just divide
both sides by 20.

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,895
18 degrees per second.

57
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,430

58
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,450
And we could have done it with
a numerator and a denominator.

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,260
3 revs per-- you know,
you could have said 3

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,940
revs over 60 seconds.

61
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,140
That's actually how I
should have done it.

62
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,430
3 revs over 60 seconds is equal
to 1 rev over 20 seconds, which

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,600
is equal to 360 degrees over 20
seconds, which is equal to 18

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,790
degrees per second, right?

65
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,350
So we're going to travel
18 degrees per second.

66
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,510
So the total number of degrees
we've traveled in t seconds is

67
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,890
going to be-- so see, if we say
the angle, that's the angle

68
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,180
from our starting point.

69
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,270
So let's say we've traveled t
seconds, and we're right there.

70
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,460
What is-- let's drop a
little altitude right here.

71
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,270
What is this angle going to be,
where this angle is right here?

72
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,070
What is this angle going to be?

73
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,000
How many degrees
have we traveled?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,180
Well, we say we traveled 18
degrees per second, so if we

75
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:03,090
travel t seconds, this is going
to be 18t degrees, right?

76
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,920
All right, so let's see if we
can figure out how their height

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,600
as a function of this-- well,
as a function of t or as

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,170
a function of this
angle right here.

79
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,270
So what is this
height right here?

80
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,220
Up here?

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,420
It's 1 meter plus the radius
because this distance

82
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,710
right here is 8.

83
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,000
So we could say that this is--
this point right here is h is

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,420
equal to 9 at this
point, right?

85
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,650
We could almost view
that as the h axis.

86
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,990
So that's h is equal to 9.

87
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,020
So at this point,
how high are they?

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,430
If this is h-- so right
now, let me draw a little

89
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,810
drop and go flat here.

90
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,510
So their height above the
ground is this distance h,

91
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,280
which is the same thing
as this distance h.

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,050
So what is that distance?

93
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,100
Well, it's going to be-- well,
if this distance is h, what is

94
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,590
this distance going to be?

95
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,540
This distance is going
to be 9 minus h.

96
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,060
How do I know this?

97
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,170
This whole distance is 9.

98
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,770
This distance is h, so-- let me
do it in a better color-- so

99
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,690
that this distance right
here is 9 minus h.

100
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,410
So let's see what we can do.

101
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:17,860
What do we know?

102
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,550
We know this distance.

103
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,300
We know this angle
is 18t degrees.

104
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,720
And do we know this side?

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,010
Sure.

106
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,730
That's the radius.

107
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,490
That's 8.

108
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,610
8 meters.

109
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,780
9 minus h meters, 8
meters, and 18 degrees.

110
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,260
And what are these sides
relative to this angle?

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,800
Well, if we were to draw a
triangle here relative to this

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,400
angle right here, the 9 minus h
is adjacent, and the 8 meters

113
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,430
is, of course, the
hypotenuse, right?

114
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,780
So what trig function deals
with adjacent and hypotenuse.

115
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,500
SOHCAHTOA.

116
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,120
CAH, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

117
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,900
So we could say the cosine at
18 degrees, the cosine of 18t

118
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,445
degrees, is equal to
its adjacent side.

119
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:14,462
The adjacent side is 9 minus h.

120
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:21,670
It's equal to 9 minus h over
the hypotenuse, over 8.

121
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,720
And now we can solve for
h, and we'll have h

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,910
as a function of t.

123
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,810
So we multiply both sides by 8.

124
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:37,090
You get 8 cosine of 18t
is equal to 9 minus h.

125
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,870
Maybe we could subtract
9 from both sides.

126
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:48,190
So we get minus 9 plus 8 cosine
of 18t is equal to minus h, and

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,340
then multiply both sides by
negative 1, and then you get

128
00:06:52,340 --> 00:07:00,130
9-- positive 9, right-- minus 8
cosine of 18t is equals

129
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:10,500
to h, or h is equal to 9
minus 8 cosine of 18t.

130
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,330
So there we have it.

131
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,230
We have expressed h
as a function of t.

132
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,050
And in the next video,
I'm actually going to

133
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,835
graph this function.

134
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,420
See you soon.

1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,660
Magnets can be created by running currents
through wires, finding a suitable material

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,910
that naturally has all the magnetic fields
of its atoms aligned, or forcing the magnetic

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,040
fields of atoms to align.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,920
But there's one more kind of magnetism that
all materials exhibit, even those whose constituent

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,460
atoms aren't magnetic - though it's so weak
that the other kinds of magnetism often overwhelm

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,280
it. Basically, an external magnetic field
causes the electrons around atoms in a material

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,039
to change course, and their new motion generates
an opposing magnetic field. This field is

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,899
pretty weak, but it does cause the material
to be repulsed from the magnet a little bit

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,409
- for example, if you hang a wooden toothpick
in a magnetic field, the ends will repel the

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,290
field and it will end up aligning across the
magnetic field. This is a convenient way to

11
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:47,149
remember the name of this kind of magnetism
- diamagnetism - since "dia" means across,

12
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,109
like the "diameter" measured across a circle.
Diamagnetic materials will repel a magnet,

13
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,319
and a diamagnetic "compass" will point across
the magnetic field - that is, it will orient

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,730
east/west.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,740
As weak as it is, diamagnetism is pretty darn
awesome because it's a repulsive effect: any

16
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:07,169
diamagnetic material will levitate in a strong
enough magnetic field! Like this chunk of

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,980
graphene, or, since water is diamagnetic,
this frog. In principle, humans could also

18
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:15,919
be levitated this way, though the magnetic
fields required would be enormous.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,050
There are also a lot of subtleties we've skated
over, like the fact that nitrogen is diamagnetic

20
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,829
even though as an atom it has unpaired electrons
- one might think that it *should* be at the

21
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:28,939
very least paramagnetic. But nitrogen atoms
bond to form N2 molecules which have full

22
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,139
outer electron shells and are thus only diamagnetic.
On the other hand, molecular O2, as we've

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,800
seen, still has unpaired electrons, and it's
paramagnetic.

24
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,899
You've probably also seen how superconductors
can levitate in a magnetic field, which is

25
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:46,039
a kind of perfect diamagnetism - not only
do the currents in a superconductor create

26
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,479
opposing magnetic fields, they expel magnetic
fields from the material entirely. But the

27
00:01:50,479 --> 00:02:07,299
root cause is very very different, and that's
a journey for another day.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's talk about the problem of finding a path through a maze.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let me draw you a maze.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Suppose you wish to find the path from the start to your goal.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't want to you to solve this problem.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Rather I want you to tell me whether it's partially observable.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes or no.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It is stochastic?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes or no.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is it continuous?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes or no.

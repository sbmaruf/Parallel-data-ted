1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, the robotic car clearly deals with a partially observable environment

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if you just look at momentary sensing input, you can't even tell how fast other cars are going.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, you need to memorize something.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It is stochastic because it's inherently unpredictable

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
what's going to happen next with other cars.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It is continuous.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's the infinitely many ways to set your steering

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or push your gas pedal or your brake,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and, well, you can argue with adversarial or not.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Depending on where you live, it might be highly adversarial.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Where I live, it isn't.

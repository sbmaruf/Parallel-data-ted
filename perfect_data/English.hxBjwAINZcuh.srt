1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620


2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,280
A card game using 36 unique
cards, four suits, diamonds,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,880
hearts, clubs and spades-- this
should be spades, not

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,730
spaces-- with cards numbered
from 1 to 9 in each suit.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,190
A hand is chosen.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,910
A hand is a collection of 9
cards, which can be sorted

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,410
however the player chooses.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,260
Fair enough.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,590
How many 9 card hands
are possible?

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,300
So let's think about it.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,080
There are 36 unique cards-- and
I won't worry about, you

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,990
know, there's nine numbers in
each suit, and there are four

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,020
suits, 4 times 9 is 36.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,420
But let's just think of the
cards as being 1 through 36,

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,330
and we're going to pick
nine of them.

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,960
So at first we'll say, well
look, I have nine slots in my

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,000
hand, right?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,720
Right?

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,430
I'm going to pick nine
cards for my hand.

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,930
And so for the very first card,
how many possible cards

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,130
can I pick from?

23
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,769
Well, there's 36 unique cards,
so for that first slot,

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,760
there's 36.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
But then that's now
part of my hand.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,710
Now for the second slot,
how many will there be

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,980
left to pick from?

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,390
Well, I've already picked
one, so there will only

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,980
be 35 to pick from.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,010
And then for the third
slot, 34, and then

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,800
it just keeps going.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,700
Then 33 to pick from, 32,
31, 30, 29, and 28.

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,800
So you might want to say that
there are 36 times 35, times

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,950
34, times 33, times 32, times
31, times 30, times 29, times

35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,020
28 possible hands.

36
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,660
Now, this would be true
if order mattered.

37
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:46,010
This would be true if
I have card 15 here.

38
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,360
Maybe I have a-- let me put it
here-- maybe I have a 9 of

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
spades here, and then I
have a bunch of cards.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,870
And maybe I have-- and
that's one hand.

41
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,800
And then I have another.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,070
So then I have cards one,
two, three, four,

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,230
five, six, seven, eight.

44
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,350
I have eight other cards.

45
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,500
Or maybe another hand is I have
the eight cards, 1, 2, 3,

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,370
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and then I
have the 9 of spades.

47
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,440
If we were thinking of these
as two different hands,

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,670
because we have the exact same
cards, but they're in

49
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,390
different order, then what I
just calculated would make a

50
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,850
lot of sense, because we
did it based on order.

51
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,070
But they're telling us that
the cards can be sorted

52
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,220
however the player chooses,
so order doesn't matter.

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,900
So we're overcounting.

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,270
We're counting all of the
different ways that the same

55
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,810
number of cards can
be arranged.

56
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,500
So in order to not overcount, we
have to divide this by the

57
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,150
ways in which nine cards
can be rearranged.

58
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,350
So we have to divide this by
the way nine cards can be

59
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,160
rearranged.

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,330
So how many ways can nine
cards be rearranged?

61
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,520
If I have nine cards and I'm
going to pick one of nine to

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,150
be in the first slot, well, that
means I have 9 ways to

63
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,690
put something in
the first slot.

64
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,050
Then in the second slot, I have
8 ways of putting a card

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,710
in the second slot, because I
took one to put it in the

66
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,170
first, so I have 8 left.

67
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:16,390
Then 7, then 6, then 5, then
4, then 3, then 2, then 1.

68
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,050
That last slot, there's only
going to be 1 card

69
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,110
left to put in it.

70
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,610
So this number right here,
where you take 9 times 8,

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,530
times 7, times 6, times 5, times
4, times 3, times 2,

72
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,610
times 1, or 9-- you start with
9 and then you multiply it by

73
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,230
every number less than 9.

74
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,340
Every, I guess we could say,
natural number less than 9.

75
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,480
This is called 9 factorial,
and you express it as an

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,660
exclamation mark.

77
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,890
So if we want to think about all
of the different ways that

78
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,640
we can have all of the different
combinations for

79
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,160
hands, this is the number of
hands if we cared about the

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,010
order, but then we want to
divide by the number of ways

81
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,640
we can order things so that
we don't overcount.

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,260
And this will be an answer
and this will

83
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,230
be the correct answer.

84
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,620
Now this is a super, super
duper large number.

85
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,010
Let's figure out how large
of a number this is.

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:11,060
We have 36-- let me scroll to
the left a little bit-- 36

87
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:24,040
times 35, times 34, times 33,
times 32, times 31, times 30,

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,870
times 29, times 28,
divided by 9.

89
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,900
Well, I can do it this way.

90
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,610
I can put a parentheses--
divided by parentheses, 9

91
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,900
times 8, times 7, times 6, times
5, times 4, times 3,

92
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,030
times 2, times 1.

93
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,180
Now, hopefully the calculator
can handle this.

94
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,770
And it gave us this number,
94,143,280.

95
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,680
Let me put this on the side,
so I can read it.

96
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:01,950
So this number right here
gives us 94,143,280.

97
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,750
So that's the answer
for this problem.

98
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,650
That there are 94,143,280
possible 9 card

99
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,680
hands in this situation.

100
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
Now, we kind of just
worked through it.

101
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,060
We reasoned our way
through it.

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,280
There is a formula for this
that does essentially the

103
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,730
exact same thing.

104
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,380
And the way that people denote
this formula is to say, look,

105
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:32,060
we have 36 things and we are
going to choose 9 of them.

106
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,370
Right?

107
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,070
And we don't care about order,
so sometimes it'll be written

108
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,440
as n choose k.

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,520
Let me write it this way.

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
So what did we do here?

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,670
We have 36 things.

112
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,010
We chose 9.

113
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,580
So this numerator over here,
this was 36 factorial.

114
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,970
But 36 factorial would go all
the way down to 27, 26, 25.

115
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,810
It would just keep going.

116
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,860
But we stopped only
nine away from 36.

117
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,190
So this is 36 factorial, so
this part right here, that

118
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,070
part right there, is not
just 36 factorial.

119
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,000
It's 36 factorial divided by
36, minus 9 factorial.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,990
What is 36 minus 9?

121
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,570
It's 27.

122
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,580
So 27 factorial-- so let's
think about this-- 36

123
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,540
factorial, it'd be 36 times
35, you keep going all the

124
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,960
way, times 28 times 27, going
all the way down to 1.

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,750
That is 36 factorial.

126
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,970
Now what is 36 minus 9

127
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,210
factorial, that's 27 factorial.

128
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,760
So if you divide by 27
factorial, 27 factorial is 27

129
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,370
times 26, all the
way down to 1.

130
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,600
Well, this and this are
the exact same thing.

131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,820
This is 27 times 26, so that
and that would cancel out.

132
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,960
So if you do 36 divided by 36,
minus 9 factorial, you just

133
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,980
get the first, the largest nine
terms of 36 factorial,

134
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,070
which is exactly what
we have over there.

135
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,950
So that is that.

136
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,730
And then we divided
it by 9 factorial.

137
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,310


138
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,320
And this right here is
called 36 choose 9.

139
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,270
And sometimes you'll see this
formula written like

140
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,700
this, n choose k.

141
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,230
And they'll write the formula as
equal to n factorial over n

142
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,890
minus k factorial, and also in
the denominator, k factorial.

143
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,420
And this is a general formula
that if you have n things, and

144
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,840
you want to find out all of the
possible ways you can pick

145
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,950
k things from those n things,
and you don't

146
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,170
care about the order.

147
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,390
All you care is about which k
things you picked, you don't

148
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,100
care about the order in which
you picked those k things.

149
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,240
So that's what we did here.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,640
Determine whether the
ordered pairs 3 comma 5 and 1

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,740
comma negative 7 are solutions
to the inequality 5x minus 3y

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,040
is greater than or equal to 25.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,060
So again, let me just try
each of these ordered pairs.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,290
We could try what happens
when x is equal to 3

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,720
and y is equal to 5
in this inequality

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,314
and see if it satisfies it.

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,230
And then we could try
it for 1 and negative 7.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,220
So let's do that first.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,750
Let's do it first for 3 and 5.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,970
So when x is 3, y is 5.

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,410
Let's see if this
actually gets satisfied.

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,176
So we get 5 times 3.

15
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,050
Let me color code it.

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,070
So this is 5-- I didn't want to
do it in that color-- 5 times

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:52,200
3 minus 3 times 5.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,380

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,640
Let's see if this is
greater than or equal to 25.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,900
So 5 times 3 is 15.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,350
And then from that, we're
going to subtract 15,

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,915
and let's see if that is
greater than or equal to 25.

23
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:15,150
Put that question mark
there because we don't know.

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,700
And 15 minus 15, that is 0.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,810
So we get the expression 0 is
greater than or equal to 25.

26
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,970
This is not true.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,640
0 is less than 25.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,580
So this is not true.

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,130
This is not true.

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,030
So this ordered pair is not
a solution to the inequality.

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,450
So this is not a solution.

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,810
You put in x is
3, y is 5, you get

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,840
0 is greater than
or equal to 25,

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,360
which is absolutely not true.

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,390
Now let's try it with
1 and negative 7.

36
00:01:49,390 --> 00:02:00,140
So we have 5 times 1
minus 3 times negative 7

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,120
needs to be greater
than or equal to 25.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,120
5 times 1 is 5, and then
minus 3 times negative 7

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,229
is negative 21.

40
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,295
So it becomes minus
negative 21 is

41
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,610
to be greater than
or equal to 25.

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,300
This is the same thing as
5 plus 21-- subtracting

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,170
a negative same thing as
adding the positive-- is

44
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,520
greater than or equal to 25.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,510
And 5 plus 21 is 26 is indeed
greater than or equal to 25.

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,770
So this works out.

47
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,512
So this is a solution.

48
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,970
And just to see if
we can visualize

49
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,287
this a little bit better, I'm
going to graph this inequality.

50
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,620
I'm not going to show you
exactly how I do it this time,

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,280
but I'm going to show you
where these points lie relative

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,055
to this solution.

53
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:47,420

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,750
So we have 5-- let me
do this is a new color.

55
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,830
So we have 5x-- that's
not a new color.

56
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,530
Having trouble
switching colors today.

57
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,090
We have 5x minus 3y is
greater than or equal to 25.

58
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,590
Let me write this
inequality in kind

59
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,927
of our slope-intercept form.

60
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,260
So this would be the same thing.

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,830
If we subtract 5x
from both sides,

62
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,020
we get negative
3y is greater than

63
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,510
or equal to negative 5x plus 25.

64
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,420
I just subtracted
5x from both sides.

65
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,850
So that gets eliminated, and you
have a negative 5x over here.

66
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,210
Now let's divide both
sides of this equation,

67
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,182
or I should say this
inequality, by negative 3.

68
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:31,140
And when you divide both
sides of an inequality

69
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,730
by a negative number, multiply
or divide by a negative number,

70
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,580
it swaps the inequality.

71
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,360
So if you divide both
sides by negative 3,

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,920
you get y is less than or
equal to negative 5 divided

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,560
by negative 3 is 5 over 3x.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,370
And then 25 divided by
negative 3 is minus 25/3.

75
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,190

76
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,860
So this is now the
expression or the inequality,

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,850
y is less than or equal
to 5/3 x minus 25/3.

78
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,930
So if I wanted to
graph this-- I'll

79
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,224
try to draw a relatively
rough graph here,

80
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,140
but really just so that
we can visualize this.

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,420

82
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,740
So our y-intercept
is negative 25/3.

83
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,380
That's the same thing
as negative 8 and 1/3.

84
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,240
So that's 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,650
and a little bit more than 8.

86
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,120
So our y-intercept is
negative 8 and 1/3 like that.

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,860
And it has a slope of 5/3.

88
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,320
So that means for every 3 it
goes to the right, it rises 5.

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,120
So it goes 1, 2, 3, it rises 5.

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,515
So the line is going to
look something like this.

91
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,590
I'm drawing a very
rough version of it.

92
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,950
So the line will look something
like that, this line over here.

93
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,480
That's if it was a y is
equal to 5/3 x minus 25/3.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,810
But here we have an inequality.

95
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,740
It's y is less than or equal to.

96
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,490
So for any x, the y's that
satisfy it are the y's

97
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,550
that equals 5/3 x minus 25/3--
that would be on the line,

98
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,970
so it would be
that point there--

99
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,820
and all the y's less than it.

100
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,360
So the solution is this
whole area right over here.

101
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,160
Since it's less than or equal
to, we can include the line.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,360
The equal to allows us
to include the line,

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,260
and the less than tells us we're
going to go below the line.

104
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,931
And we can verify
that by looking

105
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:28,180
at these two points over here.

106
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,870
We saw that 3 comma 5 is
not part of the solution.

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,010
So 3 comma 5 is 1, 2--
it's right about there

108
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,760
and then up 5.

109
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,252
So 3 comma 5 is
right above here.

110
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,710
It's in this region
above the line,

111
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,590
and notice not part
of the solution.

112
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,610
And then 1 comma negative 7 is
going to be right over here.

113
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,020
It's almost on the line.

114
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,630
So 1 comma negative 7 is
going to be right over there.

115
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,016
But it is, at least,
within this solution area.

116
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,140
So hopefully that gives
you a little bit more sense

117
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,514
of how to visualize
these things.

118
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:05,200
And we'll cover this in more
detail in future videos.

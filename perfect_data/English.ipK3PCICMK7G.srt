1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540


2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,560
A microbiologist has 1,256
microbes growing in culture.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,880
When he checks again after
fifteen minutes, there are

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,100
2,283 microbes in the same
culture, so they're growing

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,790
pretty fast. Estimate the
difference between the number

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,720
of microbes at each check by
rounding each number to the

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,330
nearest ten.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,830
So what they want us to do,
they want us to round each

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,470
number to the nearest ten, and
then with the rounded numbers,

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,890
find the difference between
the two checks.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,940
So let's round each
of these numbers.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:44,910
So we started with
1,256 microbes.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,000
So how do we round this
to the nearest ten?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,590
That's what they
want us to do.

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,140
So you look at the tens place.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,750
The tens place is that
5 right there.

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,390
So if we round it up,
it would go to a 6.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,230
If we round it down, it
would stay at a 5.

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,970
If we round it up,
this would be 60.

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,400
If we round it down,
this will be 50.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,730
And the rule for rounding is
you look at the place one

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,310
below that.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,680
You go to the ones place in this
case, and you see if that

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,990
is 5 or more, or 5 or
greater, and it is.

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,420
It's 6, which is definitely
5 or greater, so we

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,270
want to round up.

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,200
So we want to round up, and
we're rounding up to the

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,950
nearest ten.

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:34,690
So this will be go from 56
to 60, so it'll be 1,260.

30
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,380
We've rounded up.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,720
Now, when we wait fifteen
minutes, we check and we see

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,640
that there are 2,283 microbes.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,400
Once again, let's look
at the tens place.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
That's the 8 right there.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,250
Let me do that in a
different color.

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,580
That is the 8 right there.

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,380
And you look at the place
one below that.

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,860
If that's 5 or greater,
you round up.

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,480
Otherwise, you round down.

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,170
This right here, 3 is
less than 5 so you

41
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,919
want to round down.

42
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,350
We want to round down, so we're
going to be left with

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,840
2,200, and instead of 83, we're
just going to have 80.

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,010
2,280.

45
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,800
Now, they want us to estimate
the difference between the

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,830
number of microbes at each check
by rounding each number

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,070
to the nearest ten, so
we've done that part.

48
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,640
We've rounded each number
to the nearest ten.

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,330
Now we have to find
the difference.

50
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,460
So let's subtract the first
check from the second check.

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,980
That's how we get a
positive number.

52
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,080
So let's do that.

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,030
So if we subtract this 1,260--
let me just copy and paste it.

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,280
So we want to subtract this--
copy it and paste it.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,730
We want to subtract that from
the 2,280 to figure out the

56
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,900
difference.

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,270
So we're going to
subtract here.

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,020
Let me put the subtraction
sign, and let's do some

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,730
subtraction.

60
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,900
So you go first to
the ones place.

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,270
0 minus 0.

62
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,590
Well, that's just
going to be 0.

63
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,100
8 minus 6 in the tens place,
it's really 80 minus 60.

64
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,035
That's going to be 2, but since
it's in the tens place,

65
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,960
it's 20, or you could just
do 80 minus 60 is 20, so

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,640
everything makes sense so far.

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,010
2 minus 2 is 0, and then
2 minus 1 is 1.

68
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,010
So when we rounded each number
to the nearest ten and then

69
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,780
took the difference, our
estimated difference is 1,020.

70
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,467

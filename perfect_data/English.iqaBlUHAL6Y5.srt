1
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:09,801
What are you doing?&lt;br&gt;Hurry and come!

2
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:21,249
Do we really need to do all this?

3
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:22,745
You came all the way here. &lt;br /&gt;Why are you hesitating?

4
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,831
You said you don't have money to pay for the settlement.

5
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,134
First, let's do the act and then see.

6
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:31,914
After we write the contract, what can he do?

7
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,341
Man Ok, do you trust me?

8
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:38,072
Good! &lt;br&gt;Take a deep breathe.

9
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:43,071
Okay. Let's go.

10
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:48,987
Is this really 100%? &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Episode 3, Part 1

11
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:55,542
You... Who are you?

12
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:01,902
Ouch! My stomach!

13
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,666
Oh! That's right!&lt;br&gt;It's fine. It's fine.

14
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,589
Here.

15
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:12,761
Say hello. This is our new stylist, Apsala.

16
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,141
Stylist?

17
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:18,035
The rumors of your bad attitude has spread all over.

18
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,343
There isn't a single person who will be your stylist in Korea.

19
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,171
So, Sir Me specially found a foreigner.

20
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,743
Even so, how do we use someone with whom we can't communicate?

21
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:31,317
I can speak Korean, a little bit.

22
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,018
That's right. She can speak Korean a little and English a little, too.

23
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:35,902
And where was that...?

24
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,848
She was known for being the best dresser in her country.

25
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,861
Best dresser?

26
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:43,778
Hey, we're going to be late for our shoot at this rate.

27
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:48,694
First, let's work with her today, then we can decide whether or not to hire her, right?

28
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:55,128
&lt;i&gt;Subtitles brought to you by the Maid of the House 2 team at Viki

29
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,904
It's so stuffy, I could die!

30
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,181
Hey, Mr. Won.

31
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,083
Um.. He can't look at me.

32
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:29,341
In our country, if a man looks at a woman's face, I( the woman) has to die.

33
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,411
You die. We die.

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,850
What is she saying?

35
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,122
Don't look at her.

36
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:43,599
In her country, if a man looks at a woman's face,&lt;br /&gt;you die, I die and everybody dies.

37
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:44,418
Okay?

38
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,749
Okay.

39
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,135
Tae Ik's outfit is this one.

40
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,701
What's the matter?

41
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:19,621
He doesn't want to have eye contact with Man... Apsala.

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,446
I will die, you die, we die.

43
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,833
It basically means he doesn't want to die.

44
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,485
Don't worry. Don't worry. This is my job.

45
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,551
What is this?&lt;br&gt;Is this not 100% wool?

46
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,082
It's itchy.

47
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:39,257
Baek Ho Dong, what happened?

48
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,416
This is what the last stylist brought...

49
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:47,182
So, you're telling me to wear this?

50
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,403
No... I'll go bring a different one from the car.

51
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,045
Stop!

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:01,573
This jacket... outside is 100% wool.

53
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:06,872
Its size 44. &lt;br&gt;Change. Change.

54
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,407
You okay? No problem.

55
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:11,332
What did she say?

56
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,841
That is... Flip.. flip it over?

57
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,178
Okay.

58
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,987
She said that it won't itch if you flip it over and wear it.

59
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,426
Flip this over and wear it?

60
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,438
Hey! What is this? &lt;br&gt;Let go of this!

61
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:26,955
Who wears clothes inside out?

62
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,526
It looks good.

63
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,813
No problem.

64
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:35,658
Look at you. Gorgeous.

65
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:36,788
Very good.

66
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,190
Very good.

67
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,351
Wow.

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,000
What are you doing?

69
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,815
Aren't you going?

70
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:57,667
Are you happy? You like it?

71
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:00,345
What?

72
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:07,558
The fashion terrorist, Tae Ik, clears his name and becomes a fashionista.

73
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:12,344
How can you get rid of your label as terrorist that followed you around for 5 years at one go?

74
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:15,967
I don't know who found her, but that stylist is indeed great! Right?

75
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:22,789
Here. So, I prepared this for you.

76
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:24,077
What is this?

77
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,332
Memorandum for the contract of our stylist.

78
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:26,706
Memorandum?

79
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:31,298
Neither party can unilaterally break the contract for at least 3 months.

80
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:34,027
Regardless of any situations, &lt;br /&gt;whoever breaks the contract first

81
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,212
will give the other party whatever penalty fees he/she wants.

82
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:38,582
What's with a memorandum when hiring just one stylist?

83
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,806
See, this is why a memorandum is needed.

84
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,788
Sir Me found a special stylist globally,

85
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:47,063
but if you fire her suddenly, what would my position be like?

86
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,271
Your record has been pretty spectacular so far.

87
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,667
Leave it here, I'll read it later.

88
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,559
When later?

89
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:56,077
There are more than one or two companies which want to take Apsala.

90
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,882
If she goes somewhere else like this, I don't know then.

91
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:03,195
Where will you find a stylist like this? &lt;br /&gt;You kick away your own luck.

92
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,899
You should have done that earlier.

93
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:26,203
And this is...

94
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:33,166
an agreement that you will keep the location of Full House and all activities that take place in it a secret.

95
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:37,338
Oh, this is compulsory if you want to work in our industry.

96
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,863
Yes.

97
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,626
The 10 million won for the settlement for the violation of portrait rights...

98
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,122
You know that I'll be deducting it from your salary every month, right?

99
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:51,756
Yes.

100
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:54,597
Oh, and thank you for reducing the settlement.

101
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,735
Oh, that... that.. I requested it.

102
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:58,822
Since you have now become a family member, to be nice to you.

103
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:00,062
Isn't that right, Bum Soo hyung?

104
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,604
Yes.

105
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,636
Kang Hwi put in a lot of effort this time.

106
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:06,597
He also put in a lot of favorable articles for you.

107
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:09,974
Kang Hwi, thank you very much.

108
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:13,398
Oh, but instead you have to let me use all the items in Manokin Wardrobe.

109
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,930
Of course.

110
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:18,755
We are also going to get it certified, so you must carry through with the contract completely.

111
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,925
If you quit whenever you want to, or can't keep secrets...

112
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:24,038
Stylist Jang, you need to pay all the penalty fees also.

113
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,412
Don't worry.

114
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:29,912
I don't know about other things, but I'm very good at keeping secrets.

115
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:33,451
Anyway, Tae Ik successfully agreed to work with you.

116
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,716
Because of the flier incident, he must not be feeling good.

117
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:44,993
My heart was completely pounding because I was scared he caught on.

118
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:47,566
It doesn't matter. If we get it certified, it is over.

119
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:48,922
What can he do?

120
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,930
We will do it according to the law.

121
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,670
But... Can't I take this off now? It's really stuffy.

122
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,478
Wear it till we get it certified.

123
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:01,481
What will you do if Tae Ik finds out in the mean time and says he won't do it?

124
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:03,507
Ah! That's right!

125
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,911
Once it gets certified, I will tell you immediately.

126
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,435
Let's take this off quickly then.

127
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:15,923
Aigo! But... it must really be stuffy in there.

128
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,496
What day is today?

129
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,155
Tuesday.

130
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,945
Let's go.

131
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:23,704
Where?

132
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:25,403
The best place here.

133
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,032
Where are we going?

134
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,146
Let's go.

135
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,334
Hurry up!

136
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:42,914
He said "The best place"? What is this?

137
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,786
Go ahead in.

138
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:02,262
Wow! It's fascinating!

139
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,000
So that door is connected like this?

140
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,214
I think I am the only one who knows this.

141
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:12,409
Tae Ik always acts smart, but he doesn't even know that there is a secret pathway like this in his house.

142
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,652
Lee Tae Ik, you idiot!

143
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:17,291
What if he hears?

144
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:21,792
Its fine, he has health training class today, so he'll be home late at night.

145
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,465
It's over there.

146
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:34,675
Ta dah! What do you think? &lt;br&gt; Nice, isn't it?

147
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,488
Wow! What in the world!

148
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,837
I'm seeing something like this for the first time.

149
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:41,432
There's even a sauna in the house?

150
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:44,738
That guy (Tae Ik) thinks immensely about his health.

151
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:49,202
I also sometimes use the sauna, but he keeps nagging about the electricity bills.

152
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:51,843
Ugh, he's so cheap.

153
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,523
Wow! Oh my goodness!

154
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:14,251
This is that thing, right? &lt;br&gt;You hit your back with it! I saw it on TV!

155
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,212
Don't do it. It really hurts.

156
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,706
Wow, it must be so great... to have a sauna in a place like this...

157
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:25,611
Have one! That's why I brought you here.

158
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:26,512
What?

159
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:30,386
It must have been tiring going around wearing that. &lt;br&gt;It must have felt disagreeable and stuffy.

160
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:33,944
You suffered all day long, relax your body while taking a sauna.

161
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,042
Kang Hwi.

162
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:39,768
Still... how could I in somebody else's house?

163
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,355
We're one family now.

164
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:46,889
Then just do it for an hour. You can leave after cleaning up before that guy comes back.

165
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,542
But that's still... That's a little...

166
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,060
Just a moment.

167
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:54,774
Hello?

168
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,770
Ah.. It has arrived at the store?

169
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,708
Ok, I'll go to the store immediately now.

170
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:01,631
You mustn't sell it to anyone else!

171
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:05,302
Man Ok, something urgent came up and so I've got to go immediately.

172
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,878
Today, don't think about anything, just go after you've stayed here and rested.

173
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,337
Oh! And when you leave, don't forget the secret passage way, alright?

174
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,442
Kang Hwi!

175
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:19,828
It hurts a lot.

176
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:22,334
Ah! Seriously!

177
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,373
Fine... if this is fate...

178
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:43,166
It feels good!

179
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,718
Give Coach Kang a warning.

180
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:17,782
He should tell me in advance if the fitness center is closed for the day.

181
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:18,887
No, that's okay.

182
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,886
I will just take a sauna today and rest.

183
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,220
Hang up.

184
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,500
That feels so good, so good!

185
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:29,411
What is it?

186
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,517
What sound is this?

187
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,007
What's wrong with this?

188
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:21,953
Won Kang Hwi, you again!

189
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:25,044
Come out quickly when I say it nicely.

190
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:32,254
Ah! No... No way!

191
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,789
Oh! You are going to keep holding out?

192
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,482
It will be hot.

193
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:51,244
It will be suffocating!

194
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:56,162
Come out!

195
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,922
I won't move one step until you come out.

196
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:04,405
I'm going crazy!

197
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,666
Hey!

198
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,967
Why don't you come out now?

199
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:14,519
You could die like that. Huh?

200
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:18,553
Hey!

201
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:21,177
Oh my! &lt;br&gt;Ouch!

202
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,000
Who are you? &lt;br&gt;How did you come in here?

203
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,831
You are going to keep staying in that state?

204
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:33,146
Oh my! &lt;br&gt;Uh? Uh?

205
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,149
What are you looking for?

206
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,802
My clothes.

207
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:38,086
There aren't anything like that.

208
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,512
I took them off and placed them here.

209
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:46,637
Take off my clothes. Quickly!

210
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,123
This woman is crazy! &lt;br&gt;Where are you touching?

211
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,150
Give me my clothes.

212
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,440
- Give me my clothes! &lt;br&gt;- Let go of this!

213
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:55,538
Pervert! Stalker! &lt;br&gt;Let this go!

214
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,171
It's me!

215
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,332
I'm your stylist!

216
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:10,218
You...

217
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,009
Did you or didn't you see?

218
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,080
Ah! I couldn't see.

219
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:17,937
So, you collaborated with Won Kang Hwi and deceived me?

220
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,990
Putting on something like that?

221
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:24,496
Ha! You are a complete swindler.

222
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:28,303
A swindler... &lt;br&gt;I'm not one.

223
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,210
How can you not be?

224
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,593
Who is the one who cheated me saying that you are a foreigner?

225
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,969
What? Islam?

226
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,177
Apsala?

227
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,521
"You die, I'm die, we die?"

228
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,560
What is your identity?

229
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,427
You said that you are a Master of Hapkido.

230
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:47,597
So what's with the internet shopping mall and what's with the stylist?

231
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:48,604
Have you ever been a stylist?

232
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:51,739
Beginning in earnest...

233
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:54,645
But I am really good at things like this.

234
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,878
I did all the DP and styling on my shopping mall.

235
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,027
That's enough.

236
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:00,574
Leave! Leave immediately!

237
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:04,666
That... &lt;br&gt;is not possible.

238
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:05,665
Not possible?

239
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,751
Why? &lt;br&gt;I said that I don't want to but why?

240
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,220
You signed on the memorandum.

241
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,882
Ha! That is absolutely useless.

242
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,920
It's not like it is even certified.

243
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:25,263
&lt;i&gt;Man Ok, the certification is over. &lt;br&gt;Congrats! Congrats!

244
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,651
&lt;i&gt;Now, take off the chador!

245
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,990
Won Kang Hwi, this jerk!

246
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:35,951
I'm also not doing this because I want to.

247
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,334
Still, I'm really going to work hard and well.

248
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,658
Because public matters and private matters are different.

249
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:42,663
If you really don't like it...

250
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,416
I really don't like it.

251
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,641
Let's do it according to the law then.

252
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,484
You are going to act inappropriately now?

253
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:49,582
But what to do?

254
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:52,195
I absolutely can't work with someone I don't like.

255
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:53,524
You will have to.

256
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,890
If you don't want to pay the penalty for breach of contract.

257
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:01,414
So... that is how you are going to act?

258
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,897
Fine.

259
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:06,318
But I don't think Won Kang Hwi told you this?

260
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:10,996
That, among the stylists, I am the ultra no. 1 on their blacklist.

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Let's wait and see who breaks the contract first.

262
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:26,653
How dare he threaten me! &lt;br&gt;He isn't even worth one fist!

263
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,046
Ha! &lt;br&gt;Fine, bring it on!

264
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,247
I'm Jang Man Ok.

265
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,299
How dare you deceive me!

266
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,929
Bring it on!

267
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,266
Let's see if you can bear not leaving with your own feet.

268
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,734
Hello?

269
00:18:57,199 --> 00:19:02,379
I am going to check the outfits right now, so bring all the clothes I can wear for today's schedule.

270
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:05,092
What outfit...

271
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:08,208
From where at this hour?

272
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,048
So, are you saying that you can't do it?

273
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,198
I'm not saying that I can't.

274
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,564
It's till 5 o'clock.

275
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,290
Don't be late.

276
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:18,268
What is this?

277
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,257
What can I do in one hour?

278
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,828
That rude bastard!

279
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,471
Next.

280
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:44,229
I don't like it, next!

281
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:45,781
Pass. Next!

282
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:50,342
The next one, right?

283
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:53,703
But what to do? This is the last one.

284
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:59,681
What is this? &lt;br&gt;You only brought these?

285
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,949
Are you joking?

286
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:02,946
You said you only have one scheduled appointment today.

287
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:06,746
But you rejected over 30 outfits now.

288
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:09,773
You said it is a radio broadcast. &lt;br&gt;You can just wear anything.

289
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,330
Are you belittling the radio now?

290
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,652
In this age, even a radio broadcast is visible.

291
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:16,845
Internet broadcasting and captures are all possible.

292
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,572
You are asking me to just wear anything and go?

293
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,947
Then, decide on this.

294
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,481
Oh! It's wearable and good!

295
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,271
Get rid of it!

296
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,976
Really! Your standards for choosing clothes!

297
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:33,727
Where did you get all these?

298
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:36,773
Where? At a cheap market?

299
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,479
Indeed, would there be a boutique open at this hour?

300
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,930
There are. &lt;br&gt;A really nice boutique.

301
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:43,629
Forget it.

302
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,500
Hey! I don't like any of these. Get something else.

303
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,885
But why do you treat me like a neighborhood mongrel calling me , "Hey! Hey!"

304
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,334
I also have a name.

305
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:53,082
"Man", as in full.

306
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:53,821
"Ok", as in house.

307
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,990
It is Jang Man Ok, Jang Man Ok.

308
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,919
Jang Man Ok?

309
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,410
Like Jang Man Ok in "In a Mood for Love?"

310
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,741
So, you know... Jang Man Ok.

311
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:08,976
That name is too excessive for you.

312
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:09,782
That's enough!

313
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:13,082
Hey! You! Stylist Jang! &lt;br&gt;Choose between the 3.

314
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:18,113
Then, Stylist Jang.

315
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:20,707
Good, Stylist Jang.

316
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,449
I only collected all the brands that I like.

317
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,110
Go there and get wardrobe sponsorship by using my name.

318
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:28,115
Tell them that I am going to wear it during a fan meeting.

319
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,008
Sponsorship?

320
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,744
You don't know what sponsorship is?

321
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,799
I do.

322
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:39,183
Wow! This place is the place I like best.

323
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,539
She has a discerning eye. &lt;br&gt;Who is she?

324
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:04,004
It's the first time I'm seeing her.

325
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,969
Here.

326
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:11,297
Hello. I am Lee Tae Ik's stylist. &lt;br&gt;I would like some sponsorship.

327
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:12,891
Did you say Lee Tae Ik?

328
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:14,974
Yes, Lee Tae Ik in &lt;i&gt;Take One&lt;/i&gt;

329
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,810
I don't know . . .&lt;br /&gt;Now, if it was Won Kang Hwi . . .

330
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,925
But, if it is Lee Tae Ik, it would be... slightly difficult.

331
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,751
What? Why?

332
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:26,546
He didn't even wear the clothes that he took last time.

333
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:31,056
Another star wanted to wear them, but he persisted and took them.

334
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,260
I'm sorry, but look for them at some other shop.

335
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,680
For Lee Tae Ik, it will be slightly difficult.

336
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:41,377
For Lee Tae Ik, it would be slightly problematic.

337
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,590
For Lee Tae Ik, it will be slightly difficult.

338
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:45,123
Can't you allow it just once?

339
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:46,683
Isn't it possible somehow?

340
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:48,367
This is the last place. &lt;br&gt;Unni, please talk to her.

341
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,851
- I'm sorry. &lt;br&gt;- I'm sorry.

342
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,222
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,250
Yes, Department Head.

344
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:06,872
You received the press release for &lt;i&gt;Take One's&lt;/i&gt; fan meeting, right?

345
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:10,243
Yes, the scale is a slightly larger one this time.

346
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:13,695
Because all the Korean, Chinese and Japanese fans are meeting together.

347
00:23:13,697 --> 00:23:17,117
What? &lt;br&gt;What do you want?

348
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,260
How could you choose a person like that?

349
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:20,665
When was it you said that you were grateful?

350
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,608
When was it you said thank you for making you a fashionista?

351
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:24,517
When did I?

352
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:25,517
Look at him!

353
00:23:25,515 --> 00:23:28,985
Hey! Who is the one who signed the memorandum saying that you like it?

354
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:32,196
Hey! That is all because of you.

355
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:33,258
What is?

356
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:36,983
I didn't force you to do it. You did it willingly.

357
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:41,498
If you break that, you'll have to pay a huge penalty fee.

358
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,530
What are you two doing?

359
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:46,723
Is there a problem that I don't know of? &lt;br /&gt;What's with the penalty fee?

360
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:47,933
Nothing.

361
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:50,479
Are you having other thoughts because there isn't much time left on your contract?

362
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:52,115
That's not it.

363
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:54,292
If there is an agency calling you, tell me first.

364
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,603
I hate people who stab me in the back the most.

365
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:00,573
If we stab you in the back, would you even let it pass?

366
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,734
But, why did you call us?

367
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,520
Yes.

368
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:05,908
Fan meeting.

369
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:08,939
We started promotions today. &lt;br&gt;We will start selling tickets soon.

370
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:11,634
It is a fan meeting where many foreign fans will also gather.

371
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:13,872
So, starting from today, get fully prepared.

372
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:17,166
What preparations? They are people who are thankful for our mere existence.

373
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,656
Don't sass! &lt;br&gt;You are nothing without the fans.

374
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,137
I know.&lt;br&gt;I know.

375
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:26,908
Fans are like our girlfriends and family. Isn't that what you're trying to say?

376
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:34,625
&lt;i&gt;How can everything become a pictorial by just taking photographs?

377
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,765
&lt;i&gt;I want to see my Kang Hwi oppa!

378
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:37,924
&lt;i&gt;Me, too. Me, too.

379
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,560
&lt;i&gt;I have great expectations for the fan meeting.

380
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,785
&lt;i&gt;Kang Hwi's Wife, &lt;br&gt; are you going to the fan meeting?

381
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:42,705
&lt;i&gt;Of course!

382
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:43,809
&lt;i&gt;Once the ticketing opens,

383
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:46,658
&lt;i&gt; in order to obtain it through lightning-speed clicks, I am diligently exercising my fingers.

384
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:48,801
&lt;i&gt;Me, too. Me, too. Now there is only 5 minutes left.

385
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:52,985
&lt;i&gt;Once it strikes 12, I will start clicking at a crazy speed!

386
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:16,717
Four.

387
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,349
Three.

388
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,080
Two.&lt;br&gt;One.

389
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:33,695
Aish! &lt;br&gt;What is this?

390
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:36,967
Mister! Why are you turning the computer off?

391
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,680
My fingers were all ready to go!

392
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:43,228
Ah! This makes me crazy! Ah!

393
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,807
What do you mean by sold out?

394
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:49,544
How could it in 3 minutes?

395
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,260
Why did the lights go off at that timing? Aish!

396
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,051
No. No.

397
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:17,236
Wine has to be enjoyed.

398
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,209
Excuse me.

399
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,391
But, where from abroad did you come from?

400
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:26,423
Paris.

401
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:27,169
Paki?

402
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,860
Paris, where the Eiffel Tower is.

403
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,780
Ah... Paris?

404
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,611
Mon ami, Take One. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(My friend, Take One)

405
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:37,982
I really, really wanted to see them.

406
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:39,724
Mon Ami?

407
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:42,429
By chance, are you Mon Ami T1?

408
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:43,999
Yes. &lt;br&gt;And you?

409
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,711
I am Kang Hwi's Wife.

410
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:55,459
I can't go back like this.

411
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,836
I gave up everything and flew here to see &lt;i&gt;Take One&lt;/i&gt;.

412
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,224
Me, too. Me, too.

413
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:05,251
To go to this fan meeting, I even broke my friendship of 15 years and saved money.

414
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,040
Could there be any method somehow?

415
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:12,445
Kids with a lot of money buy press cards and go in.

416
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:15,571
But, the cost isn't just a few pennies. &lt;br /&gt;And, I have no connections either.

417
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:17,182
Press card?

418
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,888
If there is a method, we need to try everything.

419
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:22,824
How much money is needed will not be a problem.

420
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:26,684
Could we get it for around 1 million won?

421
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:27,974
1 million won? &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;($ 1,000)

422
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,968
Entering is important, money isn't.

423
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:34,213
That is true, but...

424
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:38,304
You must really have a lot of money, right?

425
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,430
No.&lt;br&gt;I have a little money.

426
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:43,672
Or do I have a lot of money?

427
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:46,726
- Excuse me!&lt;br&gt;- Yes?

428
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:50,939
You dropped something.

429
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:57,727
You are a reporter?

430
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:58,495
Yes.

431
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:01,417
Let's see, let's see. &lt;br&gt;Broadcasting company? Newspaper?

432
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,936
It's an internet magazine, so you wouldn't know it even if I told you where.

433
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:08,111
Do you also get press cards when singers have concerts?

434
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:08,988
Of course.

435
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,567
Without that, you can't even enter the event hall.

436
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:14,963
It's there... it's there! &lt;br&gt;Weekly Entertainment, it's there!

437
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,632
Excuse me, by any chance...

438
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,571
Can you get us some press cards?

439
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,467
How much is it?

440
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,539
This is the last place.

441
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:34,123
Welcome.

442
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:35,862
How may I help you?

443
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:40,257
That is... &lt;br&gt;I came to get some sponsorship...

444
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,142
I think it is your first time at our store.

445
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:44,719
Whose stylist are you?

446
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,671
&lt;i&gt;Take One&lt;/i&gt;.

447
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:49,902
Ah! &lt;i&gt; Take One&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;For whom...?

448
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,047
That is...&lt;br&gt;I...

449
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,125
Who do you think it is for?&lt;br&gt;It's for me. For me.

450
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:55,722
Kang Hwi.

451
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,805
Kang Hwi.

452
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:03,138
This is our new stylist, Jang Man Ok. &lt;br&gt; Please greet her, Jang Man Ok.

453
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:04,715
Hello.

454
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:07,206
Senior Manager Lee sponsors everything that I want.

455
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,098
Choose as you wish! &lt;br&gt;Isn't it alright, nuna?

456
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:14,968
Of course. We are rather grateful if you wear it as you are so stylish.

457
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:19,166
But nuna... &lt;br&gt;This time, can't you also sponsor Tae Ik's?

458
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:21,621
That is...&lt;br /&gt;We would also like to, but...

459
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:25,861
Even if we sponsor, he has never once worn it.

460
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:30,494
There is no meaning for us to sponsor if it isn't exposed.

461
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:35,519
Ah! Don't worry. &lt;br&gt;I will make sure he wears your clothes this time.

462
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,439
First, I would like to check the lining. &lt;br&gt;It would be good if it was 100% natural textile.

463
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:47,055
See... for you, this work suits you perfectly.

464
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,234
All the things you brought today . . .

465
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:52,422
The design is pretty, the fabric is good and it is well-fitting.

466
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,075
You chose them very well.

467
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:57,355
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been able to get any of these sponsored.

468
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:59,398
They were all so cold.

469
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:02,383
The business cards given by that rude bastard was of no help at all.

470
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,023
I will do it.

471
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,469
Ah, it's okay, it's okay.

472
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:10,835
He hasn't bought anything at all in the past few years.

473
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:13,366
He kept wearing his old clothes again and again.

474
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,901
Or he kept rejecting everything saying that it itches.

475
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,080
Then, why did he give me his business cards?

476
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:20,668
Excuse me, Man Ok.

477
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:24,291
Doesn't Tae Ik give you a hard time or anything like that?

478
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:27,565
He should be jumping up and down with anger because he knows that we deceived him.

479
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:31,401
That is why I... &lt;br&gt;haven't even gone near the annex for a few days.

480
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,809
What can he do? &lt;br&gt;We even got it certified.

481
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:36,206
He wouldn't fire me now.

482
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:38,363
That, we don't know yet.

483
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:43,468
Because you could leave on your own feet.

484
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,692
That will never happen.

485
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:48,382
That we will have to wait and see.

486
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:52,702
But...

487
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,470
You both seem very friendly.

488
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:58,401
Did you know each other from before?

489
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:05,641
Won Kang Hwi, why don't you explain?

490
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:17,403
&lt;i&gt;Subtitles brought to you by Maid of House 2 Team @ Viki

491
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:24,056
&lt;i&gt;Preview

492
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:27,156
&lt;i&gt;I... will bear it for just 3 months.

493
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,084
&lt;i&gt;Are you crazy?

494
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:31,975
&lt;i&gt;You aren't even a kid.&lt;/i&gt;

495
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,147
&lt;i&gt;Why do you not like it?&lt;/i&gt;

496
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:36,769
&lt;i&gt;If you aren't going to wear the stuff here, then go out naked.

497
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,048
&lt;i&gt;What the? &lt;br&gt;Are they dating each other?

498
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:41,112
&lt;i&gt;Wow!&lt;br&gt;What's all this?

499
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:45,836
&lt;i&gt;- There are many presents. &lt;br&gt;- Donate all of mine, I'm not a petty person like somebody.

500
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:47,282
&lt;i&gt;Petty person?

501
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,121
&lt;i&gt;Wow!

502
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,650
&lt;i&gt;- Should we ask him to keep wearing it?&lt;br&gt;- Yes!

503
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:54,574
&lt;i&gt;Did you by any chance see a watch?

504
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:58,134
&lt;i&gt;One got lost. &lt;br&gt;I even checked inside, but it disappeared.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,421

2
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:01,920
What we're going
to do in this video

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,190
is study a proof of
the Pythagorean theorem

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,590
that was first
discovered, or as far

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,695
as we know first discovered,
by James Garfield in 1876,

6
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,070
and what's exciting
about this is

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,670
he was not a professional
mathematician.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,086
You might know James Garfield
as the 20th president

9
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:21,960
of the United States.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,950
He was elected president.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,070
He was elected in 1880, and then
he became president in 1881.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,930
And he did this proof while
he was a sitting member

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,889
of the United States
House of Representatives.

14
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,264
And what's exciting
about that is

15
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:38,390
that it shows that Abraham
Lincoln was not the only US

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,330
politician or not the only
US President who was really

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,280
into geometry.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,429
And what Garfield realized
is, if you construct

19
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,970
a right triangle--
so I'm going to do

20
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,310
my best attempt
to construct one.

21
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,820
So let me construct
one right here.

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,440
So let's say this side
right over here is length b.

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,060
Let's say this side is
length a, and let's say

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,269
that this side, the hypotenuse
of my right triangle,

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,150
has length c.

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,860
So I've just constructed
enough a right triangle,

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,200
and let me make it clear.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,020
It is a right triangle.

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,090
He essentially flipped and
rotated this right triangle

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,750
to construct another one that
is congruent to the first one.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,900
So let me construct that.

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,420
So we're going to have length b,
and it's collinear with length

33
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,920
a.

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,600
It's along the same
line, I should say.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,530
They don't overlap
with each other.

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,070
So this is side of
length b, and then you

37
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,340
have a side of
length-- let me draw

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,460
a it so this will be a little
bit taller-- side of length b.

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,210
And then, you have your side
of length a at a right angle.

40
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,190
Your side of length a
comes in at a right angle.

41
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,970
And then, you have
your side of length c.

42
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,232

43
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,940
So the first thing we
need to think about

44
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,190
is what's the angle
between these two sides?

45
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,140
What's this mystery angle?

46
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,787
What's that mystery
angle going to be?

47
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,620
Well, it looks like
something, but let's see

48
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,411
if we can prove to
ourselves that it really

49
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:12,570
is what we think it looks like.

50
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,340
If we look at this
original triangle

51
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,030
and we call this
angle "theta," what's

52
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,210
this angle over here,
the angle that's

53
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,840
between sides of
length a and length c?

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,000
What's the measure of
this angle going to be?

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,650
Well, theta plus this
angle have to add up to 90.

56
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,900
Because you add those two
together, they add up to 90.

57
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,149
And then, you have another 90.

58
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:35,080
You're going to get 180
degrees for the interior angles

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,640
of this triangle.

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,360
So these two have
to add up to 90.

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,950
This angle is going
to be 90 minus theta.

62
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,850
Well, if this triangle
appears congruent--

63
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,110
and we've constructed
it so it is congruent--

64
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,600
the corresponding
angle to this one

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,850
is this angle right over here.

66
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,430
So this is also going to be
theta, and this right over here

67
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,385
is going to be 90 minus theta.

68
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,760
So given that this
is theta, this

69
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,550
is 90 minus theta, what
is our angle going to be?

70
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,310
Well, they all collectively
go 180 degrees.

71
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,010
So you have theta,
plus 90 minus theta,

72
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,020
plus our mystery angle is going
to be equal to 180 degrees.

73
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,770
The thetas cancel out.

74
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,840
Theta minus theta.

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,610
And you have 90 plus our
mystery angle is 180 degrees.

76
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,840
Subtract 90 from
both sides, and you

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,310
are left with your mystery
angle equaling 90 degrees.

78
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,950
So that all worked out well.

79
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,130
So let me make that
clear, and that's

80
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,940
going to be useful
for us in a second.

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,960
It's going to be useful.

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,840
So we can now say definitively
that this is 90 degrees.

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,260
This is a right angle.

84
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,780
Now, what we are
going to do is we

85
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,350
are going to
construct a trapezoid.

86
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,490
This side a is parallel
to side b down here,

87
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,190
the way it's been constructed,
and this is just one side right

88
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,960
over here.

89
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,760
This goes straight
up, and now let's just

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,890
connect these two
sides right over there.

91
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,811

92
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,310
So there's a couple
of ways to think

93
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,940
about the area of
this trapezoid.

94
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,090
One is we could just
think of it as a trapezoid

95
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,970
and come up with its
area, and then we

96
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,190
could think about it as the sum
of the areas of its components.

97
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,900
So let's just first think
of it as a trapezoid

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,410
so what do we know about
the area of a trapezoid?

99
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,580
Well, the area of a
trapezoid is going

100
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,590
to be the height of the
trapezoid, which is a plus b.

101
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,490

102
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,930
That's the height
of the trapezoid.

103
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,500
Times-- the way I
think of it-- the mean

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,260
of the top and the
bottom, or the average

105
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,405
of the top and the bottom.

106
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:45,990

107
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:53,510
Since that's this times one
half times a plus a plus b.

108
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,239

109
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,280
And the intuition there,
you're taking the height

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,030
times the average of
this bottom and the top.

111
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,530
The average of the
bottom and the top

112
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,510
gives you the area
of the trapezoid.

113
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,500
Now, how could we
also figure out

114
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,260
the area with its
component parts?

115
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,470
Regardless of how we
calculate the area, as long

116
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,050
as we do correct things,
we should come up

117
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,900
with the same result.

118
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,260
So how else can we
come up with this area?

119
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,170
Well, we could say it's the
area of the two right triangles.

120
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:37,260
The area of each of them
is one half a times b,

121
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
but there's two of them.

122
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,160
Let me do that b in
that same blue color.

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,500
But there's two of
these right triangle.

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,710
So let's multiply by two.

125
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,170
So two times one half ab.

126
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,360
That takes into consideration
this bottom right triangle

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,880
and this top one.

128
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,400
And what's the area
of this large one

129
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,150
that I will color in in green?

130
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,200
What's the area
of this large one?

131
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,920
Well, that's pretty
straightforward.

132
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,800
It's just one half c times c.

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,280
So plus one half c times c,
which is one half c squared.

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,560
Now, let's simplify this thing
and see what we come up with,

135
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,360
and you might guess where
all of this is going.

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
So let's see what we get.

137
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,680
So we can rearrange this.

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,670
Let me rearrange this.

139
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:36,370
So one half times
a plus b squared

140
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,740
is going to be equal
to 2 times one half.

141
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,280
Well, that's just
going to be one.

142
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,855
So it's going to be equal
to a times b, plus one half

143
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:49,355
c squared.

144
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:52,309

145
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,350
Well, I don't like these
one halfs laying around,

146
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,770
so let's multiply both
sides of this equation by 2.

147
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,930
I'm just going to multiply both
sides of this equation by 2.

148
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,386
On the left-hand side, I'm just
left with a plus b squared.

149
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:06,260
So let me write that.

150
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,080

151
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,395
And on the right-hand
side, I am left with 2ab.

152
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:19,340

153
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,530
Trying to keep the
color coding right.

154
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,220
And then, 2 times
one half c squared,

155
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,250
that's just going to be
c squared plus c squared.

156
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,870
Well, what happens
if you multiply out

157
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,260
a plus b times a plus b?

158
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,740
What is a plus b squared?

159
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:45,590
Well, it's going to be a
squared plus 2ab plus 2ab plus b

160
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,230
squared.

161
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,080
And then, our
right-hand side it's

162
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,930
going to be equal to
all of this business.

163
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,390
And changing all the
colors is difficult for me,

164
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,009
so let me copy and
let me paste it.

165
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,300
So it's still going to be
equal to the right-hand side.

166
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,440
Well, this is interesting.

167
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,660
How can we simplify this?

168
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,427
Is there anything that we
can subtract from both sides?

169
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,260
Well, sure there is.

170
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,790
You have a 2ab on
the left-hand side.

171
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,373
You have a 2ab on
the right-hand side.

172
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:14,830
Let's subtract 2ab
from both sides.

173
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,650
If you subtract 2ab from both
sides, what are you left with?

174
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,340
You are left with the
Pythagorean theorem.

175
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:31,040
So you're left with a squared
plus b squared is equal

176
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,120
to c squared.

177
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,130
Very, very exciting.

178
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,799
And for that, we have to
thank the 20th president

179
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,919
of the United States,
James Garfield.

180
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,890
This is really exciting.

181
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,490
The Pythagorean theorem, it was
around for thousands of years

182
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,160
before James
Garfield, and he was

183
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,900
able to contribute just
kind of fiddling around

184
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,206
while he was a member of the
US House of Representatives.

185
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:55,706

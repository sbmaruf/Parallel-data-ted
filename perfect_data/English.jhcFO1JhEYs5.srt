1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is: these 2 characters here

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
appear only in these 2 locations

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
corresponding to the words corn cream

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which appear only in these locations in the English text.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Again, we're not 100% sure that's the right answer,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but it looks like a strong correlation.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, 1 more question.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Tell me what character or characters in Chinese

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
correspond to the English word soup.

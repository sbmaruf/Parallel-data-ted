1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,040
Let's think about what
functions really do, and then

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,590
we'll think about the idea of
an inverse of a function.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,450
So let's start with a pretty
straightforward function.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,510
Let's say f of x is
equal to 2x plus 4.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:20,340
And so if I take f of 2, f of 2
is going to be equal to 2 times

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,560
2 plus 4, which is 4
plus 4, which is 8.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,470
I could take f of 3, which
is 2 times 3 plus 4,

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,920
which is equal to 10.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
6 plus 4.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,280
So let's think about it
in a little bit more

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,800
of an abstract sense.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,990
So there's a set of things that
I can input into this function.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,700
You might already be
familiar with that notion.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,050
It's the domain.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,760
The set of all of the things
that I can input into that

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
function, that is the domain.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,290
And in that domain, 2 is
sitting there, you have 3 over

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,700
there, pretty much you could
input any real number

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,850
into this function.

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,810
So this is going to be all
real, but we're making it a

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,150
nice contained set here just
to help you visualize it.

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,830
Now, when you apply the
function, let's think about

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,000
it means to take f of 2.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,900
We're inputting a number, 2,
and then the function is

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,790
outputting the number 8.

26
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,270
It is mapping us from 2 to 8.

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,490
So let's make another set here
of all of the possible values

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,930
that my function can take on.

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,300
And we can call that the range.

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,320
There are more formal ways to
talk about this, and there's a

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,640
much more rigorous discussion
of this later on, especially in

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,060
the linear algebra playlist,
but this is all the different

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,200
values I can take on.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,550
So if I take the number 2 from
our domain, I input it into the

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,270
function, we're getting
mapped to the number 8.

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,260
So let's let me draw that out.

37
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,210
So we're going from 2 to
the number 8 right there.

38
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,060
And it's being done
by the function.

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,210
The function is
doing that mapping.

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,190
That function is mapping
us from 2 to 8.

41
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,180
This right here, that
is equal to f of 2.

42
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,080
Same idea.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:18,810
You start with 3, 3 is being
mapped by the function to 10.

44
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,480
It's creating an association.

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,320
The function is mapping
us from 3 to 10.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,400
Now, this raises an
interesting question.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,840
Is there a way to get back from
8 to the 2, or is there a

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,220
way to go back from
the 10 to the 3?

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,340
Or is there some
other function?

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,870
Is there some other function,
we can call that the inverse

51
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,660
of f, that'll take us back?

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,260
Is there some other
function that'll take

53
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,200
us from 10 back to 3?

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,970
We'll call that the inverse
of f, and we'll use that as

55
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,790
notation, and it'll take
us back from 10 to 3.

56
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,360
Is there a way to do that?

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,070
Will that same inverse of f,
will it take us back from--

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,290
if we apply 8 to it-- will
that take us back to 2?

59
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,760
Now, all this seems very
abstract and difficult.

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,990
What you'll find is it's
actually very easy to solve for

61
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,030
this inverse of f, and I think
once we solve for it, it'll

62
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,540
make it clear what
I'm talking about.

63
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,820
That the function takes you
from 2 to 8, the inverse will

64
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,360
take us back from 8 to 2.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,470
So to think about that, let's
just define-- let's just

66
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,790
say y is equal to f of x.

67
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,510
So y is equal to f of x,
is equal to 2x plus 4.

68
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,110
So I can write just y is equal
to 2x plus 4, and this once

69
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,420
again, this is our function.

70
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,470
You give me an x,
it'll give me a y.

71
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,990
But we want to go the
other way around.

72
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,760
We want to give you
a y and get an x.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,490
So all we have to do is
solve for x in terms of y.

74
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,160
So let's do that.

75
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,460
If we subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation-- let me

76
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,350
switch colors-- if we subtract
4 from both sides of this

77
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,310
equation, we get y minus 4 is
equal to 2x, and then if we

78
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,270
divide both sides of this
equation by 2, we get y over 2

79
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,750
minus 2-- 4 divided by 2
is 2-- is equal to x.

80
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,160
Or if we just want to write it
that way, we can just swap the

81
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,100
sides, we get x is equal to
1/2y-- same thing as

82
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,190
y over 2-- minus 2.

83
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,270
So what we have here is
a function of y that

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,750
gives us an x, which is
exactly what we wanted.

85
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,510
We want a function of these
values that map back to an x.

86
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,100
So we can call this-- we could
say that this is equal to--

87
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,840
I'll do it in the same color--
this is equal to f inverse

88
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,570
as a function of y.

89
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,080
Or let me just write it
a little bit cleaner.

90
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,050
We could say f inverse as a
function of y-- so we can have

91
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,650
10 or 8-- so now the range is
now the domain for f inverse.

92
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,120
f inverse as a function of y
is equal to 1/2y minus 2.

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,570
So all we did is we started
with our original function, y

94
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,300
is equal to 2x plus 4, we
solved for-- over here, we've

95
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,870
solved for y in terms of x--
then we just do a little bit of

96
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,250
algebra, solve for x in terms
of y, and we say that that is

97
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,580
our inverse as a function of y.

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,370
Which is right over here.

99
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,570
And then, if we, you know, you
can say this is-- you could

100
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,640
replace the y with an a, a b,
an x, whatever you want to do,

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,240
so then we can just
rename the y as x.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,000
So if you put an x into this
function, you would get f

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,660
inverse of x is equal
to 1/2x minus 2.

104
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,340
So all you do, you solve for x,
and then you swap the y and the

105
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,720
x, if you want to
do it that way.

106
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,240
That's the easiest way
to think about it.

107
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,110
And one thing I want to point
out is what happens when you

108
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,255
graph the function
and the inverse.

109
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:48,420
So let me just do a
little quick and dirty

110
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,160
graph right here.

111
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,190
And then I'll do a bunch of
examples of actually solving

112
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,580
for inverses, but I really
just wanted to give

113
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,030
you the general idea.

114
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,010
Function takes you from the
domain to the range, the

115
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,570
inverse will take you from that
point back to the original

116
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,810
value, if it exists.

117
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,500
So if I were to graph these--
just let me draw a little

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,790
coordinate axis right here,
draw a little bit of a

119
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,040
coordinate axis right there.

120
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,630
This first function, 2x plus 4,
its y intercept is going to be

121
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:24,520
1, 2, 3, 4, just like that, and
then its slope will

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,610
look like this.

123
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,470
It has a slope of 2, so it will
look something like-- its graph

124
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,870
will look-- let me make it a
little bit neater than that--

125
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,400
it'll look something like that.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,450
That's what that
function looks like.

127
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,390
What does this
function look like?

128
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,680
What does the inverse function
look like, as a function of x?

129
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,980
Remember we solved for x,
and then we swapped the x

130
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,900
and the y, essentially.

131
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,570
We could say now that y is
equal to f inverse of x.

132
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,400
So we have a y-intercept
of negative 2, 1, 2, and

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,150
now the slope is 1/2.

134
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,230
The slope looks like this.

135
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,120
Let me see if I can draw it.

136
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,510
The slope looks-- or the line
looks something like that.

137
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,170
And what's the
relationship here?

138
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,060
I mean, you know, these look
kind of related, it looks

139
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,080
like they're reflected
about something.

140
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,990
It'll be a little bit more
clear what they're reflected

141
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,530
about if we draw the
line y is equal to x.

142
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,250
So the line y equals
x looks like that.

143
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,420
I'll do it as a dotted line.

144
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,620
And you could see, you have
the function and its inverse,

145
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,780
they're reflected about
the line y is equal to x.

146
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,100
And hopefully, that
makes sense here.

147
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,330
Because over here, on
this line, let's take

148
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,530
an easy example.

149
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,610
Our function, when you take
0-- so f of 0 is equal to 4.

150
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,130
Our function is mapping 0 to 4.

151
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:00,050
The inverse function, if
you take f inverse of 4, f

152
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,920
inverse of 4 is equal to 0.

153
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,120
Or the inverse function is
mapping us from 4 to 0.

154
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,210
Which is exactly
what we expected.

155
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,720
The function takes us from the
x to the y world, and then we

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,240
swap it, we were swapping
the x and the y.

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,060
We would take the inverse.

158
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,055
And that's why it's reflected
around y equals x.

159
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:24,030
So this example that I just
showed you right here, function

160
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:30,070
takes you from 0 to 4-- maybe I
should do that in the function

161
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,810
color-- so the function takes
you from 0 to 4, that's the

162
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,680
function f of 0 is 4, you see
that right there, so it goes

163
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,550
from 0 to 4, and then
the inverse takes us

164
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,830
back from 4 to 0.

165
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,380
So f inverse takes us
back from 4 to 0.

166
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,430
You saw that right there.

167
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,750
When you evaluate 4 here,
1/2 times 4 minus 2 is 0.

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,730
The next couple of videos we'll
do a bunch of examples so you

169
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,180
really understand how to solve
these and are able to do

170
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,010
the exercises on our
application for this.

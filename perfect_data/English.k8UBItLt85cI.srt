1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670


2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,520
A town had a population
of 11,256 in 1995.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,340
By 2010, the population
in that town had

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,560
increased by 4,312.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,290
Estimate the town's population
in 2010 by first rounding

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,300
these two numbers to the
nearest hundred.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,470
So we could figure out the
exact population just by

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,400
adding these two, but they
want us to round to the

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,930
nearest hundred first and get an
estimate, and then add, so

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,430
it'll be an estimate of
the town's population.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,840
So first we have this 11,256.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,130
That's the population in 1995.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,610
11,256.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,020
We need to round to the nearest
hundred, so let's look

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,350
at the hundreds place here.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,790
So this is either going to go
down to 200 or go up to 300,

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,130
depending on what the
next place is or

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,290
the next lowest place.

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,370
So we go down to the tens
place, we see a 5.

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,140
5 is 5 or greater, so we want
to round this number up.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,000
We are going to round up.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,220
So if you round up
to the nearest

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,960
hundred, you get 11,000.

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,970
Instead of having 256, we're
rounding up to 300.

25
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,170
300 is closer to 256
than 200 is.

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,770
That's why we're rounding
up to that.

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,010
That's why it's to the
nearest hundred.

28
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:19,780
Now, we added 4,312
people, so 4,312.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,270
Now once again, we look
at the hundreds place.

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,920
We go one spot below that.

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,730
The question we're trying to
answer: Do we go down to 4,300

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,900
or do we go up to 4,400?

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,370
Which one is closer?

34
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,230
Well, we see we only
have a 1 here.

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:38,420
1 is definitely less than 5,
so we want to round down.

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,930
So 312 is closer to 300.

37
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,850
We round down to just a 3 here
and these get zeroed out.

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,310
So 4,300.

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,520
And now we're ready to add
our rounded numbers.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,700
0 plus 0 is 0.

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,160
0 plus 0 is 0.

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,140
3 plus 3 is 6.

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,630
Let's put a comma here
so it's easy to

44
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,880
read every third digit.

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,080
1 plus 4 is 5, and then 1 plus--
we have nothing here,

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
so we just bring down that 1.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,710
We could have written
that addition there.

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,944
We're adding those
two numbers.

49
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:14,005
So our estimate of the town's
population in 2010 is 15,600.

50
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,399

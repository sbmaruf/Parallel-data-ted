1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,880
We need to add 7.056
to 605.7 to 5.67.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,170
Now when you're adding any
number, you always want to

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,370
make sure you line up numbers
in the same place.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,910
And especially when you're
dealing with decimals, the

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,790
easiest way to do that is to
just line up the decimals.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,783
So let's do that.

7
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:27,010
So the first number right
here is 7,056.

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:36,700
This second number right
here is 605.7.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,150
And then this last
number is 5.67.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,940
So now we have everything
lined up.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,340
Everything that's in the ones
place is below or above

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,420
everything else in
the ones place.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,430
Everything in the tenths place
is below or above everything

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,190
else in the tenths place,
and so on and so forth.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,770
So we can add.

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,020
So let's add it.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,690
So you want to start off
in the smallest place.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,040
So you start off here.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,950
This is the tenths, hundredths,
thousandths place.

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,680
This is literally 6 thousandths,
and you want to

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,170
add it to the other
thousandths.

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,990
There aren't any other
thousandths.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,950
So you can view it two ways.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,770
You can just bring in this 6
down, or you could view this

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,450
605.7 as the same thing
as 605.700.

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,920
You can add as many zeroes to
the right of this decimal, to

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,970
the right of the 7, as you want,
since we're sitting on

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,890
the right side of the decimal,
without changing its value.

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,840
You can also do it here.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,350
This 5.67, you can write
it as 5.670.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,800
When you write it like
this, and you have 6

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,910
plus 0 plus 0 is 6.

33
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,780
And you keep going.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,550
5 plus 0 plus 7 is 12.

35
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,480
You write the 2 in the
hundredths place,

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,130
and carry the 1.

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,440
1 plus 0 plus 7 is
8, plus 6 is 14.

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,170
Write the 4, regroup the
1 into the ones place.

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,950
1 plus 7 is 8.

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,759
8 plus 5 is 13.

41
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,350
13 plus 5 is 18.

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,500
This is 18.

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,190
Carry or regroup the 1.

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,120
1 plus 0 is just 1.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,010
And then finally.

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,380
You have the 6 in the
hundreds place.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,840
Nothing gets added to it, so you
can just bring down that 6

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,190
and it's right there.

49
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,410
And you don't want to
forget the decimal.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,730
And so when you add the numbers
you get 618.426, or

51
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,010
618 and 426 thousandths.

52
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,620
And we're done.

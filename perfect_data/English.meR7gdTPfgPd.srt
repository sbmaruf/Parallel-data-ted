1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, I want to start with a question:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When was the last time you were called childish?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For kids like me,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
being called childish can be a frequent occurrence.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Every time we make irrational demands,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
exhibit irresponsible behavior

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or display any other signs

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of being normal American citizens,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we are called childish.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Which really bothers me.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
After all, take a look at these events:

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Imperialism and colonization,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
world wars, George W. Bush.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, what have kids done?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, Anne Frank touched millions

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with her powerful account of the Holocaust,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and, most recently,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Charlie Simpson helped to raise

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
120,000 pounds for Haiti

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
on his little bike.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, as you can see evidenced by such examples,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
age has absolutely nothing to do with it.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The traits the word childish addresses

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
are seen so often in adults

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that we should abolish this age-discriminatory word

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
when it comes to criticizing behavior

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
(Applause)

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then again, who's to say

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that certain types of irrational thinking

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
aren't exactly what the world needs?

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Maybe you've had grand plans before

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but stopped yourself, thinking,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
"That's impossible," or, "That costs too much,"

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or, "That won't benefit me."

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For better or worse, we kids aren't hampered as much

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and hopeful thinking.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like my wish that no one went hungry

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
or that everything were a free kind of utopia.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How many of you still dream like that

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and believe in the possibilities?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Sometimes a knowledge of history

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and the past failures of utopian ideals

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
can be a burden

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
because you know that if everything were free,

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
then the food stocks would become depleted

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and scarce and lead to chaos.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
On the other hand,

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we kids still dream about perfection.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And that's a good thing because in order

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to make anything a reality,

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you have to dream about it first.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In many ways, our audacity to imagine

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
helps push the boundaries of possibility.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
my home state -- yoohoo Washington!

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
(Applause) --

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
has a program called Kids Design Glass,

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and kids draw their own ideas for glass art.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now, the resident artist said they got

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
some of their best ideas through the program

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
because kids don't think about the limitations

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes;

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
they just think of good ideas.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now, when you think of glass, you might

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
think of colorful Chihuly designs

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
or maybe Italian vases,

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
into the realm of broken-hearted snakes

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
(Laughter)

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now, our inherent wisdom

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
doesn't have to be insider's knowledge.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults,

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and we have a lot to share.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I think that adults should start learning from kids.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Now, I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd,

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
teachers and students, and I like this analogy:

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
telling students, "Do this, do that."

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The students should teach their teachers.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Learning between grown ups and kids

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
should be reciprocal.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The reality, unfortunately, is a little different,

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right?

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If I doubt my older sister's ability

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to pay back the 10 percent interest

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I established on her last loan,

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
until she pays it back. (Laughter)

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
True story, by the way.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now, adults seem to have

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
from every "don't do that,

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
don't do this" in the school handbook

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to restrictions on school Internet use.

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
As history points out, regimes become oppressive

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
when they're fearful about keeping control.

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And although adults may not be quite at the level

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of totalitarian regimes,

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
kids have no, or very little say in making the rules,

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
when really the attitude should be reciprocal,

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
meaning that the adult population should learn

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and take into account the wishes

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
of the younger population.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, what's even worse than restriction

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is that adults often underestimate kids abilities.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We love challenges, but when expectations are low,

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
trust me, we will sink to them.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My own parents had anything but low expectations

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
for me and my sister.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
or lawyers or anything like that,

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but my dad did read to us

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
about Aristotle

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and pioneer germ fighters

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
when lots of other kids were hearing

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
(Laughter)

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I loved to write from the age of four,

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and when I was six

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I wrote over 300 short stories

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
on that little laptop,

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and I wanted to get published.

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that a kid wanted to get published

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
or saying wait until you're older,

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
my parents were really supportive.

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Many publishers were not quite so encouraging,

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
one large children's publisher ironically saying

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that they didn't work with children --

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
children's publisher not working with children?

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
(Laughter)

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, one publisher, Action Publishing,

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
was willing to take that leap and trust me

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and to listen to what I had to say.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," -- you see it here --

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools,

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
keynoting to thousands of educators

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and finally, today, speaking to you.

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I appreciate your attention today,

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
because to show that you truly care,

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you listen.

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But there's a problem with this rosy picture

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
of kids being so much better than adults.

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Kids grow up and become adults just like you.

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
(Laughter)

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Or just like you? Really?

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult,

160
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but rather better adults than you have been,

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
which may be a little challenging

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
considering your guys' credentials (Laughter).

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But the way progress happens

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is because new generations and new eras

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
grow and develop and become better than the previous ones.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No matter your position or place in life,

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it is imperative to create opportunities for children

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
so that we can grow up to blow you away.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(Laughter)

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Adults and fellow TEDsters,

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you need to listen and learn from kids

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and trust us and expect more from us.

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You must lend an ear today,

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because we are the leaders of tomorrow,

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
which means we're going to be taking care of you

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
when you're old and senile. No, just kidding.

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, really, we are going to be the next generation,

179
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the ones who will bring this world forward.

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you,

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
remember that cloning is possible,

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and that involves going through childhood again,

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
in which case you'll want to be heard

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
just like my generation.

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now, the world needs opportunities

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
for new leaders and new ideas.

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you ready to make the match?

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Because the world's problems

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.

191
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Thank you.

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
(Applause)

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you. Thank you.

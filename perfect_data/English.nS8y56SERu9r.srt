1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,330
Let's try to learn a thing or two about ratios.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,280
So ratios are just expressions that compare quantities.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,840
So that might just be a fancy way-- let me just --of saying

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,790
something that you may or may not understand.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,050
So let me give you actual examples.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,530
If I have ten horses and I have five dogs.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,810
And someone were to come to me and say Sal, what is the

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:36,660
ratio is of horses to dogs?

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,000
So I want to know how many horses do I have for

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,270
some number of dogs.

11
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:45,890
So I could say I have ten horses for every five dogs.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,460
So I could say the ratio of horses to dogs is ten:five.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,310
Or I could also write that as a fraction.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,720
I could say the ratio of horses to dogs is ten / five.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
Or I could just write it out.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,890
I could say it is ten to five.

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,070
These all are saying the same thing.

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,600
And the thing I write first, or the thing that I write on

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,610
top, is the number of horses.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,790
So this is the number of horses right there.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,850
If I wanted to talk about the number of dogs, this is the

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,610
number of dogs, that's the number of dogs, or that's

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,430
the number of dogs.

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,710
I'm just-- These are all just expressions that are

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,130
comparing two quantities.

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,590
Now, I just said I have ten horses for every five dogs.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,730
But what does that mean?

28
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,300
That means I have five horses for every one dog.

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,760
Sorry.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,390
Not five horses for every one dog.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,100
It means I have two horses for every one dog, right?

32
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,360
If for five dogs I have ten, that means that for every one of these

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,230
dogs, there are two horses.

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,650
For every one of-- every two of these horses, there's one dog.

35
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,470
I just kind of reasoned through that.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,800
So this is-- I have two horses for every one dog.

37
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,020
But how do you get there?

38
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,450
How do you get from ten:five to two:one?

39
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,820
Well you can think of what's the biggest number that divides

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,070
into both of these numbers?

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,880
What's their greatest common divisor?

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,310
I have a whole video on that.

43
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,450
The biggest number that divides into both of these guys is five.

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,180
So you divide both of them by five and you can kind of get this

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,200
ratio into a reduced form.

46
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,120
And if I write it here, it would be the same thing

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,080
as two / one or two to one.

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,590
And so what's interesting about ratios, it isn't literally, or

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,120
doesn't always have to be literally, the number of horses

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,170
and the numbers of dogs you have.

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,410
What a ratio tells you is how many horses do

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,560
I have for every dog.

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,640
Or how many dogs do I have for every horse.

54
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,490
Now, just to make things clear, what if someone asked me what

55
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,330
is the ratio of dogs to horses?

56
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,900
So what's the difference in these two statements?

57
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,050
Here I said horses to dogs.

58
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,900
Here I'm saying dogs to horses.

59
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,700
So, since I've switched the ratio-- What I'm looking for--

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,150
I'm looking for the ratio of dogs to horses, I

61
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,950
switch the numbers.

62
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,080
So dogs-- For every five dogs, I have ten horses.

63
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,250
Or if I divide both of these by five, for every one

64
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,830
dog, I have five horses.

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,090
So the ratio of dogs to horses is five:ten or one:five.

66
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,070
Or you could write it this way.

67
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,830
one to-- I can write it-- Let me write it down here.

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,270
one / five.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,740
Or I could write one to five.

70
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,180
And the general convention-- This wouldn't be

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,160
necessarily incorrect.

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,270
That's not wrong.

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,220
But the general convention is to get your ratio or your

74
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,510
fraction, if you want to call it that, into the simplest

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,360
form or into this reduced form right there.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,880
Let's just do a couple of other examples.

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,370
Let's say I have twenty apples.

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,260
Let's say I have forty oranges.

79
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,020
And let's say that I have sixty strawberries.

80
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,220
Now what is the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries?

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,880
I could write it like this.

82
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,910
I could write what is the ratio of-- I'll write it like this

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,300
--apples:oranges:strawberries?

84
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:48,590
Well I can start off by literally saying, well for sixty

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,810
strawberries-- for every sixty strawberries, I have forty

86
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,500
oranges and I have twenty apples.

87
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,490
And this would be legitimate.

88
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,620
You could say the ratio of apples to oranges to

89
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,180
strawberries are twenty:forty-- Sorry.

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,710
twenty:forty:sixty.

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,950
And that wouldn't be wrong.

92
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,700
But we saw before, we could put into reduced form.

93
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,440
So we think of what's the largest number that divides

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,540
into all three of these?

95
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,050
We can't just do it into two of these now because now my ratio

96
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,180
has three actual quantities.

97
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,130
Well the largest number that divides into all

98
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,960
of these guys is twenty.

99
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,160
If we divide all of them by twenty, we can then say for every one

100
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,610
apple, I now have-- you divide this guy by twenty --I have two

101
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,740
oranges, and I have three strawberries.

102
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,750
So the ratio of apples to oranges to

103
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,650
strawberries is one:two:three.

104
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,190
And I got that, in every case, by just dividing

105
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,560
these guys all by twenty.

106
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,750
I divided by twenty.

107
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,160
I think you get the general idea.

108
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,660
If someone were to ask you what's the ratio of-- Let me

109
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,860
just write it down because it never hurts to have a little

110
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,260
bit more clarification.

111
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,910
If someone wanted to know the ratio of strawberries

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,000
to oranges-- Let me get into my orange color.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,670
Strawberries to oranges to apples.

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,320
I thought I was going to do that in yellow.

115
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,890
To apples.

116
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,570
What is this ratio going to be?

117
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:29,090
Well for every three strawberries, I have two oranges

118
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,570
and I have one apple.

119
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,060
So then it would be three:two:one.

120
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,780
The general idea is whatever order someone asks you for the

121
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,420
different items, you put-- the ratio is going to be in

122
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,320
that same exact order.

123
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,360
Now, in all of the examples so far I gave you the number of

124
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,680
quantity-- the quantity of things we had and I-- we

125
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,160
figured out the ratio.

126
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,800
What if it went the other way?

127
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,330
What if I told you a ratio?

128
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:07,910
What if I said the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom

129
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,920
is-- Let's say the ratio of boys to girls is two / three.

130
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,180
Which I could've also written as two:three just like that.

131
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,350
So for every two boys, I have three girls or for every three

132
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,190
girls, I have two boys.

133
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:38,080
And let's say that there are forty students in the classroom.

134
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,000
And then someone were to ask you how many girls are there?

135
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:50,310
How many girls are in the classroom?

136
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,310
So this seems a little bit more convoluted than

137
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,190
what we did before.

138
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,540
We know the total number of students and we know the ratio.

139
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,070
But how many girls are in the room?

140
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,380
So let's think about it this way.

141
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,860
The fact that the ratio of boys to girls-- I'll

142
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,890
write it like this.

143
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,500
Boys-- Maybe I'll be stereotypical with the colors.

144
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:14,480
The ratio of boys to girls is equal to two:three.

145
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,010
Hate to be so stereotypical, but it doesn't hurt.

146
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,110
two:three.

147
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,860
The ratio of boys to girls is two:three.

148
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,850
So this stands for every three girls, there's two boys.

149
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,340
For every two boys, there's three girls.

150
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,070
But what does it also say?

151
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:39,480
It also says for every five students, there are what?

152
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,930
There are two boys and three girls.

153
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,790
Now why is this statement helpful?

154
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,530
Well how many groups of five students do I have?

155
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,230
I have forty students in my class right there, right?

156
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
I have forty students in my class.

157
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,720
And for every five students, there are two boys and three girls.

158
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,320
So how many groups of five students do I have?

159
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,910
So I have a total of forty students.

160
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,480
Let me do it in this purple color.

161
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:28,830
I have forty students and then there are five students per group.

162
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,490
And I figured out that group just by looking at the ratio.

163
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,120
For every five students, I have two boys and three girls.

164
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,370
How many groups of five students do I have?

165
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,270
So that means that I have eight groups-- forty divided by five --I

166
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,100
have eight groups of five students.

167
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,940
Now we're wondering how many girls there are.

168
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:06,770
So each group is going to have three girls.

169
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,340
So how many girls do I have?

170
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,950
I have eight groups, each of them have three girls.

171
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,760
So I have eight groups times three girls per group is equal to

172
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,950
twenty-four girls in the classroom.

173
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,080
And you could do the same exercise with boys.

174
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,110
How many boys are there?

175
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
There's a couple of ways you could do it.

176
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,520
You could say for every group, there are two boys.

177
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
There's eight groups.

178
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,770
There's sixteen boys.

179
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,850
Or you could say there's forty students.

180
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,550
twenty-four of them are girls.

181
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,340
forty minus twenty-four is sixteen.

182
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,850
So either way you get to sixteen boys.

183
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,750
And if you want to pick up a fast way to do it.

184
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,650
It would be identical.

185
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,930
You'd say look, two plus three is five.

186
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,080
For every five students, two boys, three girls.

187
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,350
How many groups are there?

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
You say forty divided by five is equal to eight groups.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,070
Every group has three girls.

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,670
So you do eight times three is equal to twenty-four girls.

191
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,120
Let's do one that's a little bit harder than that.

192
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:16,780
Let's do one where I say that the ratio of let's say--

193
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,140
Well let's go back to the farm example.

194
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,910
The ratio of sheep-- I'll do sheep in white.

195
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:35,970
The ratio of sheep to-- I don't know --chickens

196
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,350
to-- I don't know.

197
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,960
What's another farm animal?

198
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,910
--to pigs.

199
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,500
The ratio of sheep to chicken to pigs-- Maybe I should just

200
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,540
say chicken right there.

201
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,820
The ratio of sheep to chicken to pigs-- Or chickens.

202
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,380
I should say chickens.

203
00:11:51,380 --> 00:12:02,120
Is-- Let's say the ratio is two:five:ten.

204
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,980
And notice, I can't reduce this anymore.

205
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,470
There's no number that divides into all of these.

206
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,100
So this is the ratio if sheep to chickens to pigs.

207
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,770
And let's say that I have a total of fifty-one animals.

208
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,730
And I want to know how many chickens do I have.

209
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,790
Well we do the same idea.

210
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,390
For every two sheep, I have five chickens and I have ten pigs.

211
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:48,760
That tells me for every seventeen animals-- So every group of

212
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,340
seventeen animals, what do I have?

213
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,720
And where did I get seventeen from?

214
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,590
I just added two plus five plus ten.

215
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,360
For every seventeen animals, I'm going to have-- Let

216
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,000
me pick a new color.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm going to have two sheep, five chickens, and ten pigs.

218
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,280
Now, how many groups of seventeen animals do I have?

219
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,590
I have a total of fifty-one animals.

220
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,820
So if there's seventeen animals per group, fifty-one animals divided

221
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,830
by seventeen animals per group.

222
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:32,370
I have three groups of seventeen animals.

223
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,060
Now I want to know how many chickens.

224
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,950
Every group has five chickens.

225
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,010
We already know that.

226
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,620
And I have three groups.

227
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,540
So I have three groups.

228
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,960
Every group has five chickens.

229
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,100
So I'm going to have three times five chickens, which

230
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,080
is equal to fifteen chickens.

231
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,960
Not too bad.

232
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,650
All I did is add these up and say for every seventeen animals,

233
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,110
I've got five chickens.

234
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,260
I've got three groups of seventeen.

235
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,250
So for each of those groups, I have five chickens.

236
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,520
three times five is fifteen chicken.

237
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,370
You could use the same process to figure out the number sheep

238
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,620
or pigs you might have.

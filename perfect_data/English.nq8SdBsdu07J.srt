<i>Episode 6

3
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:29,008
I'm sorry...

4
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,508
I'm really sorry.

5
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:37,133
I know how hard it was arranging to take this test.

6
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:40,007
Everyone was looking forward to it... But...

7
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,009
Because of me...

8
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:48,121
All because I needlesly tagged along.

9
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:51,767
You should have just left me and went on.

10
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,033
I should have, shouldn't I?

11
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,667
What you're saying is right.

12
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:03,004
I really am an obstacle in your life.

13
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:08,567
No!Even that word doesn't describe it.

14
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm a disaster.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,333
Oh, it's here.

16
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:19,733
Where?

17
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,575
Oh, Ha Ni!

18
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:21,367
Ha Ni!

19
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:24,933
Aigoo! What's happening here?!

20
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:30,833
What!? You even have a cast!? Aigoo! What to do...

21
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, Baek Seung Jo! You agai...

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,002
Joon Gu, drop it.

23
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey! Whenever you're around Ha Ni, she's always prone to accidents!

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,233
I told you to drop it!

25
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,933
Oh? Ha... Ha Ni...

26
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,067
Just go.

27
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,003
Ha Ni...

28
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:54,067
I want to be alone now.

29
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,933
Hey, Ha Ni... Are you alright?

30
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:01,004
Come on, let go of me!

31
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:04,233
Ha Ni, is there anything you want to eat? I'll go buy it and come back.

32
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,933
Ha Ni! Let go of me, will you?

33
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,939
Should I leave as well?

34
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,433
Go...

35
00:02:11,433 --> 00:03:03,005
Go and get some rest.

36
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:05,567
I'm really sorry.

37
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,567
I'm at a loss for words, Jae Su (sister-in-law) (He's referring to Seung Jo's dad as his brother)

38
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,567
Not at all...

39
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:17,033
That's right. After dropping her off at the hospital, he still had plenty of time to go, but he chose not to.

40
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:22,433
But still... He was reluctant to take the test before and now he was going to...

41
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,467
He must have something in mind.

42
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:28,033
Don't worry...

43
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:47,007
After all, a youth who doesn't rebel is not a youth. It's just a child.

44
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,533
Thanks, Unni.

45
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,367
Alright, now let's get to work! The customers should be rolling on in soon.

46
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,967
- Yes.- Yes.

47
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:01,504
Hey, Ha Ni, our family must have a knack for speedy recoveries.

48
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:07,933
Even the doctor said that there wasn't such a case like yours, where a patient left the hospital so early.

49
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,000
Dad...

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,467
Yeah?

51
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:14,933
Shouldn't we leave Seung Jo's house?

52
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,003
Why?

53
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:19,033
Do you feel like we're being senseless?

54
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:25,001
There's no need to! Everyone is worrying about you more than they are for Seung Jo.

55
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,593
That's why it bothers me even more.

56
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:33,067
Why am I always like this?

57
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,533
Oh, welcome!

58
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,004
Hey, a customer came in now, so come on and get up.

59
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:54,067
I'll drop you off.

60
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:57,796
Is Ha Ni still sulking?

61
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:02,002
She won't move an inch from her room and she'll barely eat anything.

62
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,367
When everyone's asleep, she comes out and starts to walk around.

63
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:14,367
In the middle of the night, I was startled because I thought she was a ghost!

64
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,767
Baek Seung Jo.

65
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,967
You should treat her well.

66
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:23,567
Just a kind word from you will solve things. Why are you causing her so much grief!

67
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,005
I did tell her!

68
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,967
Really?

69
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,003
What did you say?

70
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:32,667
Thanks for not letting me do the interview.

71
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:39,233
Is that some sort of condolence? That's like slapping the face of a crying kid.

72
00:05:39,233 --> 00:06:01,667
You don't get to eat either until Ha Ni starts eating again.

73
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:05,667
<i>I heard you gave Seung Jo some sleeping pills on the morning of the test.<i>

74
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:15,233
<i>Even like this, do you think you still have any right to say that you like him?<i>

75
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:29,008
Good luck on your test! FIGHTING!

76
00:06:29,008 --> 00:07:04,004
I'm feeling uneasy so I'm going to at least make sure he goes inside of the building.

77
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:57,633
[From: Ha Ni For: Mother, Father... I'm sorry...]

78
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:06,467
Long time no see.

79
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:11,433
Are you leaving?

80
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:15,006
Is it because I didn't get into Tae Sung University?

81
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:20,867
That, too, but also because of the cough medicine incident.

82
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,067
I keep trying to do well, but I keep...

83
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:30,367
No matter how hard I think about it, I don't think I should be by your side.

84
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,599
I don't know what might happen because of me.

85
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,833
Don't hold me back.

86
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,008
I don't have any thought like that.

87
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,566
Huh?

88
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:45,733
Should I help you? It seems heavy.

89
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,008
It's okay.

90
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,004
Alright then.

91
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,003
Take care!

92
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:54,167
Ah.

93
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:58,533
Is it for me?

94
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:03,004
Parang University?

95
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:09,133
Oh... Enrollment fee?

96
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,833
Eh, zero won?

97
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:18,433
The enrollment fee is zero won!

98
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:23,233
Undecided major? Ah, this must be a mistake. It isn't for me.

99
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:27,333
It's addressed to "Baek Seung Jo".

100
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,567
Baek Seung Jo...?

101
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,939
Baek Seung Jo?!

102
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:39,063
<i>Oh my...

103
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:42,404
Really?

104
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:45,781
You're really going to Parang University?

105
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,676
Why?

106
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,098
Who knows?

107
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:50,854
Because they begged me to go?

108
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,066
What?!

109
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:55,452
<i>If you would enroll at our school,

110
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:58,077
<i>we would offer everything and anything.

111
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,494
They're going to pay for me to study abroad, as well as combined masters and doctorate degrees.

112
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,716
If I stay within the school,

113
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:08,131
they said they would even give me a tenured position there.

114
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:13,004
For me, they were really pissed asking why they should pick me.

115
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:17,187
But, even if it's Parang University,

116
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:20,838
isn't priority admission the same for every university?

117
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,954
Through all of my life up until now,

118
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:25,807
I think I was the angriest last year.

119
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:31,602
I was anxious and pissed wondering what's going to happen today.

120
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:35,438
It was a complete mess.

121
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:37,687
Sorry.

122
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,865
But it was fun.

123
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:44,833
Falling asleep while taking the exam was fun.

124
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,284
Wondering what my score would be after taking the exam, that was new too.

125
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:54,000
Thanks to you, I experienced a lot of new things.

126
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,454
It was pretty exciting and fun.

127
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,198
So...

128
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:04,086
So?

129
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:07,406
So you're saying...

130
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:10,082
You're going because of me? To Parang University?

131
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:15,091
It's not because of you, but because of me!

132
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,052
Just until I figure out what I want to do.

133
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:22,296
I want to live an exciting life until then.

134
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:28,094
I thought your grandmother said to live a fun life!

135
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:28,089
Right.

136
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,019
Well then...

137
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:36,732
See you.

138
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:40,168
Wait!

139
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,387
Then...

140
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:45,132
Does that mean I can stay here longer?

141
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:47,204
I won't be a pain anymore!

142
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,294
You won't?

143
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:53,573
Sure you won't.

144
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:56,731
I guess so...

145
00:11:56,731 --> 00:11:58,724
...but I'll try!

146
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:19,898
I promise your life will be fun and exciting!

147
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:23,187
Thanks.

148
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:25,387
But...

149
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:30,077
So you've been feigning ignorance this whole time even knowing about Parang University?!

150
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:34,208
Even after seeing how I was dying of guilt?

151
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,305
Why?!

152
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,384
Because it was fun.

153
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,813
What?!

154
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,388
You don't like it?

155
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:41,314
If you don't like it, I can cancel it right now...

156
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,454
No, no, no!

157
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:48,133
I like it.

158
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:48,097
I'm happy.

159
00:12:48,097 --> 00:13:23,949
I know.

160
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,682
See, I told you he had something in mind.

161
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,057
Parang University?

162
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:33,094
When did he apply here?

163
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:34,698
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:39,271
If my Ha Ni hadn't gotten into that accident, he would have just gone to Tae San University.

165
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:45,493
What's so great about Tae San University? It's probably full of kids like Seung Jo.

166
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:49,823
Ha Ni and Seung Jo at the same university...

167
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:55,702
No matter how you see it, don't you think those two are a match made in heaven?

168
00:13:55,702 --> 00:14:12,725
Match made in heaven...

169
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,322
Welcome!

170
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:15,437
Hello, Father!

171
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,187
I came again! Oh, let me do it, I'll do it!

172
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:21,216
It's fine!

173
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,057
Look here, look here!

174
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:25,027
What chef does chores like this?!

175
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:27,893
Chef?

176
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:29,919
If it's what I think you came here to say, then just go on your way.

177
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,527
Oh no, today I came to give you this.

178
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:35,184
What's this?

179
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:38,037
Oh yes, it's safflower seeds.

180
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,046
Safflower seeds?

181
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,077
I hear this is the best for healing broken bones!

182
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:45,165
Even after one has taken off the cast, stuff like this needs to be eaten like crazy!

183
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:49,238
Please mix it with some water and feed it to Ha Ni.

184
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:54,735
Thanks.

185
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:55,557
Chef!

186
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:57,522
What are you doing?

187
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,594
Please don't be like this! Can't you just take me in?!

188
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:03,337
Sixty years of tradition, So Pal Bok Noodles!

189
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,184
That tradition can't come to end, right?!

190
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:09,689
How many times do I have to tell you? Do something you want to do. Don't decide because of my Ha Ni!

191
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:12,725
What I want to do is this!

192
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,003
When I first ate your noodles...

193
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:17,403
...my heart felt like it was sinking!

194
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:18,237
Let go.

195
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:19,795
Father!

196
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,185
- Let go! - Please, please!

197
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,027
Excuse me!

198
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:25,728
Yes, welcome!

199
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:28,097
Oh yes.

200
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:29,347
Is this...

201
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:34,395
...the place that sells some porridge that helps people get accepted into university?

202
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:36,503
It's just that I hear that...

203
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:40,757
...eating your porridge helps even the 90th place students get into Parang University.

204
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:43,451
By any chance, do you mean Bul Nak porridge?

205
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,009
Yes, that's right!

206
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,655
This is it, this is the place! Come in, come in!

207
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,047
- Oh, this is wonderful! - Oh, yes, welcome!

208
00:15:49,047 --> 00:16:01,362
So this is where it was!

209
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:03,402
Hey, hurry and get up!

210
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:04,062
No sir!

211
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,037
I will not budge from this spot today, not until you take me in!

212
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:09,027
You little...

213
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:12,703
Your act is an obstruction of business!

214
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,037
Obstruction? Oh, that won't do.

215
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,816
Excuse me, can we get some warm water here?

216
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:20,242
- Oh, yes, yes! - Yes, yes! It's fine, I'll do it!

217
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:22,005
Can we see a few menus?

218
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:22,903
Oh, yes!

219
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:29,057
Menu, menu, menu! Oh, here they are!

220
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:30,042
Here you go.

221
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:33,749
You look so hardworking.

222
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:36,046
There's even pine mushroom and oyster chopped noodles!

223
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:38,937
This is the best time for oysters, you know.

224
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:41,254
The aroma of the ocean is embedded in them!

225
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:44,194
Such a youngster, but you're great at business.

226
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:48,007
- Then I'll have the oyster noodles. - I want the Bul Nak porridge.

227
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,353
Alright, then one order of oyster noodles, and three Bul Nak porridges?

228
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:54,337
Got it! Please wait just a bit!

229
00:16:54,337 --> 00:17:07,182
One Chopped Noodles and three Bul Nak porridges!

230
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:09,103
Are you looking for something in particular?

231
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:12,057
I was just...

232
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,784
Where are the mp3s and digital cameras?

233
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:26,437
They're in that corner.

234
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:39,017
How nifty!

There are so many things I want to buy for him.

237
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:06,068
It looks so nice.

238
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:27,462
It'll probably look really good on Seung Jo.

239
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:29,831
Thank you, boss! I'll give it my all!

She's constantly late these days.

250
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:23,103
She's probably lazing around now that she's been accepted into university!

Worried?

Don't you know that my mom stays up late every day so that she can open the door for you?

Huh?

Ah, what do i do!

Out of all those chicken places, why did he have to order from this one?

00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:09,606
Hurry up.

332
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,049
She is not here.

333
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:24,444
Let's go.

334
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:25,292
Hey!

335
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:26,063
Jong Joo Ri!

336
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,079
Oh my gosh!

337
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,926
I thought I was about to drop my liver! (saying for when you get surprised)

338
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:35,093
What's up with you Jung Joo Ri? And your phone is off too.

339
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,913
What are you doing here alone?

340
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:40,305
You are busy...

341
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:41,948
Since you guys are college students.

342
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:43,645
Not yet.

343
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,845
We haven't graduated.

344
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:47,303
Sorry!

345
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:50,156
My mind was everywhere.

346
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:52,731
It is alright.

347
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:55,807
I said I was going to go to the academy (cram school) this morning and left.

348
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,886
I didn't want to.

349
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:03,083
But there wasn't anywhere for me to go but school.

350
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,065
You're going to retake your SATs?

351
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:09,733
My parents are telling me to retake them and try to get into even a 2 year college.

352
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:15,999
What will I do if I go to college? It's just a waste of money.

353
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:18,755
Why don't they know their daughter?

354
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:22,021
Then, tell them that you're going to do what you want to do.

355
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:24,025
I have to know how to do something in order for me to tell them.

356
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:26,743
Why would you not (have something you know how to do)?

357
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:32,766
What is there?

358
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:36,231
You're the one that made me this hairstyle.

359
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,013
You are right!

360
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:40,961
You always tie my hair and pin it too.

361
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:41,972
That's right.

362
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,003
Our teacher did also recognize it.

363
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:45,185
- Of course! - Right?

364
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:48,275
The best.

365
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:49,584
Okay.

366
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:50,758
I'm not going to retake them!

367
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:53,291
I'm not retaking the SATs!

368
00:28:53,291 --> 00:29:10,381
It is also the end of the annoying stuff.

369
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:18,275
Colleges that are concerned only with names, this dirty world!

370
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:22,773
You dirty world that only makes it easy for the pretty girls!

371
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:24,673
Jung Joo Ri is beautiful.

372
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:31,371
Dok Go Min Ah is pretty too!

373
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:35,322
Anyways, congratulations to you both on going to college.

374
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:37,748
Ah embarrassing! This isn't my style.

375
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:38,723
We know, we know!

376
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:41,593
So strange of you!

377
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:49,885
Don't do it.

378
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:56,115
<i>What's the deal about life.You're filled with so many worries.

379
00:29:56,115 --> 00:30:02,799
<i>Change up that frustration.

380
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,647
<i>A completely empty wallet.

381
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:10,397
<i>You're drenched in despair.

382
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:14,587
<i>I know how that feels.

383
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:17,122
<i>But with your...

384
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:19,098
<i>Heart afire!

385
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:22,839
<i>Sometimes you have to face it head on.

386
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:28,121
<i>Sometimes you've got to cry, that is youth.

387
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:31,549
<i>Just kick it out.

388
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:34,472
<i>Sometimes you have to face it head on.

389
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:38,595
<i>Sometimes you've got to cry, that is youth.

390
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:46,286
<i>That's what it is!

391
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:47,779
I'm not going to university.

392
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,098
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't go!

393
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:56,078
<i>

394
00:30:56,078 --> 00:31:01,409
<i>

395
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,531
Ha Ni!

396
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:14,957
Baek Seung Jo, hurry and come down!

397
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,058
You know...

398
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:17,893
What?

399
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,504
Here!

400
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,013
What is it?

401
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,255
Just because I feel bad for a lot of things...

402
00:31:24,255 --> 00:31:26,524
And I'm thankful for a lot of things too.

403
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:28,189
You could call it a graduation gift too.

404
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:33,208
You're going to do an all-in-one, is it?

405
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:40,122
Want to see?

406
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:41,456
What the hell is this?

407
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,421
It's a head massager.

408
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:45,922
It seems like you're constantly talking about how your head hurts.

409
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:48,024
Where did you buy something like this?

410
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:52,453
Definitely a gift like Oh Ha Ni.

411
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:55,379
You don't like it?

412
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:56,172
Want me to exchange it for something else?

413
00:31:56,172 --> 00:32:00,579
You're going to be late to your graduation? Why aren't you two coming down?

414
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,838
Oh my, what's this?

415
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,798
Is it a helmet?

416
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,885
It's a head massager.

417
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,702
Since Seung Jo uses his head a lot.

418
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:12,508
Oh this works as a neck massager as well.

419
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:14,825
It's a gift for Seung Jo?

420
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:19,328
Oh godness, you're so thoughtful.

421
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:20,768
Try it on Seung Jo!

422
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:26,387
I don't want to! Who in the world wears things like this!

423
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:29,002
He's so mean.

424
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:31,268
Goodness, this looks expensive.

425
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:33,447
Where did you get the money?

426
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:34,646
I took on a part-time job.

427
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,657
So that's why you were late these days.

428
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:45,497
Oh my.

429
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:50,373
Mic test. 1. 2.

430
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:52,941
What are you going to do if you're freaking out already?

431
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,055
Guys, I can't breathe very well.

432
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:58,802
I've never been up on stage!

433
00:32:58,802 --> 00:32:59,648
Oh gosh.

434
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03,056
Our homeroom teacher put on a real show in order to have you accept on behalf of our class.

435
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:05,248
- Really?- That's right.

436
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:09,924
Class 1's representative is Baek Seung Jo, and Class 7's is Oh Ha Ni.

437
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:14,029
So do a good job! Don't go up there and fall over! Crashing all over the place!

438
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,201
Don't say such negative things.

439
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,005
Be careful.

440
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:20,332
Hey Baek Seung Jo.

441
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,009
I hear you got into Parang University.

442
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:24,068
Speak up. What kind of intentions do you have?

443
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,083
Intentions?

444
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,816
That's right. There are hundreds of universities.

445
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:31,817
But I hear you've got the skills to get into Taesan University even if you took the exams with your eyes closed.

446
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:33,482
So why the hell are you going to Parang University?

447
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:34,977
So I could see you react like this.

448
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:35,766
What?

449
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:36,813
You little! Till the very end I see!

450
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:39,046
Can everyone hear?

451
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:42,693
We will now be commencing with

452
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:51,663
Parang High School's graduation ceremony.

453
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:52,424
Ha Ni and Seung Jo?

454
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:57,012
Though there were SAT mysteries every year...

455
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:59,115
This year,

456
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:03,486
There were 2 events that were

457
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:06,913
so absurd you couldn't really call it a mystery.

458
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:09,115
One of them is...

459
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:14,583
Class 7's Oh Ha Ni getting into Parang University.

460
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:20,359
The other one is that Class 1's Baek Seung Jo is also attending Parang University.

461
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,976
Does this make any sense?!

462
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:28,843
It doesn't make any sense!

463
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:30,744
Next is the speech from the representative of the graduating class.

464
00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:48,052
Class 1's Baek Seung Jo.

465
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,628
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said this.

466
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:55,032
The great thing in the world...

467
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:57,833
Is not so much where we stand,

468
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,447
As in what direction we are moving.

469
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:03,941
Today we graduate.

470
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,891
After 3 years, this is how far we have come.

471
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:10,334
Once this chapter of your life ends, where will all of you go?

472
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,818
To the Chinese restaurant?

473
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:17,019
Family restaurants?

474
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,406
Though I joke about it,

475
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:21,028
Even I didn't know which direction I was supposed to go.

476
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:26,202
Actually no, I've still yet to find it.

477
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:30,544
But I found something out.

478
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:35,978
It's thanks to a grandmother whose face I've never even seen.

479
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:39,693
She said that I just need to have fun, and others need to be happy.

480
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:42,526
She said that's how to live life.

481
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:47,017
But as you all know, I don't have the personality to make others happy?

482
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:51,349
So for the time being, I'm planning on at least living a fun life.

483
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,414
Though I still don't know how to yet.

484
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:58,315
I hope for all of you out there, despite which direction your life is headed...

485
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:02,017
I hope that road is filled with fun.

486
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:12,776
Thank you.

487
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:14,616
<i>Just have a fun life.

488
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:15,823
<i>Have fun.

489
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:17,309
<i>Fun?

490
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,189
<i>My grandmother used to say it all the time.

491
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:24,507
<i>Ha Ni, enjoy your life, have fun.

492
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:27,247
<i>You have fun, and make sure others are happy.

493
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:30,243

Here! I'm here!

Please come up to the podium.

505

Do you, Baek Seung Jo, take Oh Ha Ni to be your lawfully wedded wife,

506
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:49,701
Despite rain, snow, wind, and flowers?

507
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:54,002
Do you vow to love and cherish her?

508
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:56,651
I do.

509
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,818
Do you, Oh Ha Ni, take Baek Seung Jo to be your lawfully wedded husband,

Despite...

511
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:15,665
Yes, I do!

Ha Ni, I promise too!

513
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,384
You're the only one for me!

514
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:23,626
I'm going to look onto just you until my dying days!

515
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:27,978
Who says?! I'm against it! I'm totally against it!

516
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:33,122
Hey Seung Jo, you say something too! Tell him that you're totally against it too!

517
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:35,382
Is that Baek Seung Jo's mom?

518
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:36,096
Baek Seung Jo's got it rough too.

519
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:39,228
There's Oh Ha Ni, and his mom.

520

What are you doing? Hurry and come down!

521
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:02,051
Oh gosh, Oh Ha Ni.

522
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,646
You were so funny today.

523
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,034
Seriously!

524
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:08,408
I told you, you were going to fall.

525
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:13,884
Oh goodness Ha Ni, I'm sorry. I was just so worked up earlier on.

526
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,892
It's fine. Did Eun Jo leave too?

527
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:20,131
Yeah. He said I'm too embarassing.

528
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:24,044
What does it matter? Right? What's it matter?

529
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:25,685
It was totally like you, Oh Ha Ni.

530
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:31,052
- You think so?- That's right, if nothing happened you wouldn't be Oh Ha Ni.

531
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:35,111
Oh yea, but where is Seung Jo?

532
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:39,094
I told him I wanted to take pictures.

533
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:42,764
I want to start school again

534
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:44,554
And wear a school uniform like this.

535

Yeah.

Are you saying that you want me to take a picture with you now?

562

No.

563
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:17,037
It doesn't.

00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:41,237
Intimidated?

yes?

636
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:49,637
I didn't mean to point out class 7. Why...did you feel intimidated?

637
00:46:49,637 --> 00:46:53,503
Sending students who are smart to college isn't special enough to boast about

Do you know how sad it feels to have a student flying sky high get crumpled up in Parang University?

641
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:11,909
Teacher, I told you, that's not it.

642

it's not because of her

My life in the dumps, because of a stupid girl like her,

644
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:23,065
That's an insult.

645
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:26,303
stupid?

00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,332
Just a little?

650
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:40,103

She really is an idiot.

652
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:48,603
I was taught to never boast about what you didn't earn

653
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:52,003
just because you were born smart, doesn't give you the right to look down on other people

654
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:56,337
nobody is putting anyone down, those people just put themselves down

655
00:47:56,337 --> 00:48:01,937
You call that an inferiority complex.

656
00:48:01,937 --> 00:48:04,017
Bad jerk.

657
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:07,137
A jerk that doesn't even have one grain of human feelings.

658
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:11,269
Rude... Icy... BAD LUCK!!!

659
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:17,802
But then why do you love that rude, icy, bad luck jerk?

660
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:19,037
What?

661
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:23,077
You said that you're happy and that you liked it.

662
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:29,843
Even in your textbook, it was filled with my name.

663
00:48:29,843 --> 00:48:33,403
Therefore, could you have even studied?

664
00:48:33,403 --> 00:48:38,003
Really~ you want to take it that far, huh?

665
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:43,803
In that case, I have something in mind too

666
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:48,017
You are prepared for this?

667
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:54,037
Everyone! I present to you little Baek Seung Jo!

668
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:55,097
Oh Ha Ni!

669
00:48:55,097 --> 00:48:57,403
Hey! What's this?!

670
00:48:57,403 --> 00:49:00,437
Totally cute!

671
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:09,203
Did you really think I'd only have one picture? And you call yourself a genius?

672
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:11,637
You, come with me.

673
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:15,067
It hurts! I said it hurts!

674
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:22,008
What do you think you're doing?!

675
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:24,633
What?

676
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,000
What are you going to do?

677
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,009
So you spilled the beans, huh?

678
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:34,867
Even if you try to scare me, I'm not scared!!

679
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:37,667
The feelings I had for you...

680
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:42,233
You made it the target of ridicule in front of all those kids.

681
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:46,767
I was getting revenge.

682
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:49,633
I want to quit now.

683
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:53,167
I don't want to like you anymore.

684
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,006
Can you do that?

685
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:58,133
I can!

686
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,967
Baek Seung Jo, your temper...

687
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:03,467
I've figured out how tiring it is.

688
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:07,009
With graduation, my crush will also come to an end.

689
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:10,767
I'm going to stop.

690
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:12,267
You're going to forget me?

691
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:13,633
Yeah.

692
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:16,133
I'll forget someone like you, and at college I'll meet someone...

693
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:30,533
Then try to forget me.

694
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:33,000
<i>I don't know from when it was.

695
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,007
<i>Since the moment I saw you.

696
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:39,933
<i>Every minute, every second I think of you.

697
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:41,005
Looks like something else.

698
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,367
<i>What are you doing

699
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:46,833
Merong. (sticking tongue out)

700
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:50,000
<i>Where could you be right now.

701
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,004
<i>Ooh baby.

702
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:54,067
<i>Even when I look here and there.

703
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:56,667
<i>Even this and that.

704
00:50:56,667 --> 00:51:00,533
<i>I keep on liking you that I'm about to go crazy.

705
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:04,567
K... kiss?

706
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:08,067
Did I... with Baek Seung Jo...

707
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:17,267
Baek Seung Jo kissed me.

708
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:22,067
<i>I want to know only you and love you.

709
00:51:22,067 --> 00:51:26,867
<i>Although spending time in love can be a waste,

710
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:31,567
<i>I don't want to do anything without you.

711
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:32,733
<i>Everyday.

712
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:37,006
<i>When I open my eyes in the morning, I want to see you.

713
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:42,533
<i>Now I can't live a day without you.

714
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:47,767
<i>I want to hear that you love me too.

715
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:50,333
<i>I love you everyday.

716
00:51:50,333 --> 00:52:03,004
<i>I love only you. The two of us.

717
00:52:03,004 --> 00:52:05,001
Ha Ni!

718
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,367
You said you have to go to school today!

719
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:21,967
Ah that's right.

720
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:26,633
What should I do if we see each other?

721
00:52:26,633 --> 00:52:30,067
How awkward.

722
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:39,833
What should I say?

723
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:46,367
You already got up.

724
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:57,433
Ah come on.

725
00:52:57,433 --> 00:53:07,267
So thick(headed).

726
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:14,767
Thick? Can you say that between people who kissed?

727
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:16,833
What is this?

728
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:20,167
I was the only one who didn't know what to do.

729
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:25,133
I'm like a dummy.

730
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:29,567
I was wanting to see you kids in your high school uniforms as high school students again.

731
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:33,322
But seeing you guys today, it's like seeing you as college students.

732
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:37,767
What's wrong with me?

733
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,167
Ha Ni ah.

734
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:42,004
What do you think about Seung Jo's hairstyle?

735
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:48,467
After he said he wouldn't go, I forced him to go and get a perm.

736
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:50,667
What do you think? It turned out good, huh?

737
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,567
Yes, it looks good on him.

738
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:55,000
See, I told you it looked okay.

739
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,008
I ate well. I'll be leaving first.

740
00:53:57,008 --> 00:54:01,002
Why are you going already? There's still time.

741
00:54:01,002 --> 00:54:06,633
Hey! You should go with Ha Ni.

742
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:16,006
Oppa!

743
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:20,004
After saying to go together, he just leaves.

744
00:54:20,004 --> 00:54:23,133
Then why did he come to the same school as me?

745
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:25,333
No...

746
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:29,867
Aigoo, what are you talking to yourself about?

747
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,667
Did you get a perm?

748
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:32,867
Yeah.

749
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:36,467
Beauty students get a 50% discount. How does it look?

750
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:39,867
It looks like you're wearing a helmet.

751
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,967
Yeah, you're right. It looks like I'm wearing a helmet.

752
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:44,167
Hey take it off. Take it off.

753
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:46,009
No, it's pretty!

754
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:51,000
Considering that it's done by only half price.

755
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,233
Hey when is Dok Go Min Ah coming? She's the one that wanted to get lunch together.

756
00:54:57,233 --> 00:55:11,133
I'm here.

757
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:13,004
Are you Min Ah?

758
00:55:13,004 --> 00:55:14,004
What's wrong?

759
00:55:14,004 --> 00:55:17,167
Hey, I saw you earlier.

760
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,006
But I couldn't recognize you!

761
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:22,533
What's up... you look so cool!

762
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:27,006
You liked reading animation books so much... it looks like you jumped right out of one of them.

763
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:29,005


764
00:55:29,005 --> 00:55:31,096
You're really pretty.

765
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:31,537
You like it?

766
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:37,067
Yeah.

767
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:41,933
Should I retake the SATs?

768
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:51,933
You threw away all your books.

769
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,002
What is it Oh Ha Ni...

770
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:56,033
Something happened didn't it?

771
00:55:56,033 --> 00:56:00,633
What is it? Hurry up and tell us.

772
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:02,233
What?

773
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:08,667
Why do you keep covering your mouth?

774
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:12,667
Actually... I kissed.

775
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:16,823
What did you say?

776
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:19,904
WHAT!!! KISSED???

777
00:56:19,904 --> 00:56:22,033
When? Where? How was it?

778
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,133
You're being too loud.

779
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:26,767
If you guys kissed, doesn't that make you guys a couple?

780
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:30,003
But... what should I call it?

781
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:32,006
It was like he was playing around.

782
00:56:32,006 --> 00:56:36,567
What are you talking about? It's a kiss, a kiss. You said you did it?

783
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,759
I'm going to tell everyone.

784
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:41,767
Hey!

785
00:56:41,767 --> 00:57:05,267
Oh Ha Ni, you have some good luck.

786
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:07,004
You like it, you liked it didn't you?

787
00:57:07,004 --> 00:57:10,002


788
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:14,004


789
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:15,867
Are you alright Ha Ni-ya?

790
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:17,933
Are you ok?

791
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:19,067
Yes.

792
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:29,000
Are you okay?

793
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,467
You didn't get hit, did you?

794
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:35,367
Yes. I'm sorry.

795
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:36,867
Are you a new student?

796
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:39,033
Yes.

797
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:39,967
Welcome.

798
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:58,633
Pardon?

799
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:03,533
Where is it?

800
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:04,533
It must be here.

801
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:05,733
Oh.

802
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,008
Isn't this the car from earlier?

803
00:58:09,008 --> 00:58:11,167
Maybe.

804
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:14,167
That girl was super pretty.

805
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,001
Pretty?

806
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:17,767
I saw her up close.

807
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:21,533
Her hair was really nice and thick.

808
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:26,533
"New student? Welcome!"

809
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:27,933
She must be an upperclassman

810
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:30,233
Yeah. What grade could she be in?

811
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:31,001
3rd year?

812
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:33,467
That's enough. Stop talking about the girl and let's hurry.

813
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,067
Hey, don't you have to go meet your husband?

814
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:41,567
yyaa~ husband!?!

815
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:42,467
You're coming later, right?

816
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:44,467
No, I don't think I'll be able to go.

817
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:46,167
He's over there.

818
00:58:46,167 --> 00:59:05,533
Oh Ha Ni!

819
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,433
Hi!

820
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:09,098
Hi. Hi.

821
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:13,681
What, is there something?

822
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:18,048
I just wanted to see what your class looked like.

823
00:59:18,048 --> 00:59:19,567
I was curious.

824

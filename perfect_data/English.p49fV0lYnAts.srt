00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,400
E=mc^2 may be the most famous equation inthe worldâ€¦ but what you might not know is

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,869
that it isn't the whole story. It just describesobjects that have mass and that aren't moving.

3
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:17,670
The full equation is E, squared, equals mc squared, squared, plus p times c, squared,

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,929
where p represents the momentum of the objectin question. This might all seem a bit confusing,

5
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:28,859
but in fact you can draw it as a right trianglewith sides E, m c squared, and p times c - and

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,329
just use the pythagorean theorem (a squaredplus b squared equals c squared) to give you

7
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,320
the equation.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,440
Also, from here it's clear to see that foran object that isn't moving and thus doesn't

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,719
have any momentum and thus p is zero, we getback our good ole' friend E=mc2. On the other

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,719
hand, if the particle in question is massless(like light), then mass is zero and we get

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,750
E equals p times c. This tells us that theenergy of a massless particle (like a photon

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,629
of light) is the same as its momentum (upto a factor of the speed of light).

13
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:03,399
In fact, the closer the energy of somethingis to p times c, the closer that something

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,950
is to behaving like light (I mean, look here,this tiny little bit of mass is hardly mass

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,860
at all).

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,660
Anyway, as an example, an object's velocityis equal to the speed of light times the ratio

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,720
of the object's momentum to energy - or pcover E. If your momentum increases, p times

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,250
c gets closer and closer to equaling yourenergy, so their ratio gets closer and closer

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,830
to being one, and your speed gets closer andcloser to light speed. But because of that

20
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,860
tiny little bit of mass, the momentum sideof the triangle will always be a little bit

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,420
smaller than the energy side. No matter howhard you try to increase your momentum, it

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,960
never quite gets to the point where p timesc equals your energy, and thus your velocity

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,460
can never quite reach the speed of light,all because the hypotenuse of a right triangle

24
00:01:46,460 --> 99:59:59,999
is longer than its legs.

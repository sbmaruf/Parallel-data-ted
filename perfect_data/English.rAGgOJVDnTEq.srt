1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,490
We have the inequality 2/3
is greater than negative

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,380
4y minus 8 and 1/3.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,410
Now, the first thing I want to
do here, just because mixed

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,770
numbers bother me-- they're
actually hard to deal with

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,470
mathematically.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,950
They're easy to think about--
oh, it's a little

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,079
bit more than 8.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,910
Let's convert this to an
improper fraction.

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,910
So 8 and 1/3 is equal to-- the
denominator's going to be 3.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,080
3 times 8 is 24, plus 1 is 25.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,920
So this thing over here is the
same thing as 25 over 3.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,240
Let me just rewrite
the whole thing.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:42,340
So it's 2/3 is greater than
negative 4y minus 25 over 3.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,730
Now, the next thing I want to
do, just because dealing with

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,260
fractions are a bit of a pain,
is multiply both sides of this

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,430
inequality by some
quantity that'll

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,550
eliminate the fractions.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,610
And the easiest one I can think
of is multiply both

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,480
sides by 3.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,870
That'll get rid of the 3's
in the denominator.

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,430
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 3.

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,850
That's the left-hand side.

23
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,520
And then I'm going to multiply
the right-hand side.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,750
3, I'll put it in parentheses
like that.

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,870
Well, one point that I want to
point out is that I did not

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,160
have to swap the inequality
sign, because I multiplied

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,300
both sides by a positive
number.

28
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,600
If the 3 was a negative number,
if I multiplied both

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,650
sides by negative 3, or negative
1, or negative

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,920
whatever, I would have had to
swap the inequality sign.

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,290
Anyway, let's simplify this.

32
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,040
So the left-hand side, we have
3 times 2/3, which is just 2.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,660
2 is greater than.

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,050
And then we can distribute
this 3.

35
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,580
3 times negative 4y
is negative 12y.

36
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,880
And then 3 times negative 25
over 3 is just negative 25.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,450
Now, we want to get all of our
constant terms on one side of

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,830
the inequality and all of our
variable terms-- the only

39
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,660
variable here is y on the other
side-- the y is already

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,070
sitting here, so let's just get
this 25 on the other side

41
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,820
of the inequality.

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,490
And we can do that by
adding 25 to both

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,310
sides of this equation.

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,755
So let's add 25 to both sides
of this equation.

45
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:09,300
--Adding 25--

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,642
And with the left-hand side, 2
plus 25 five is 27 and we're

47
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:16,070
going to get 27 is
greater than.

48
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,030
The right-hand side of the
inequality is negative 12y.

49
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,930
And then negative 25 plus 25,
those cancel out, that was the

50
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,300
whole point, so we're left
with 27 is greater than

51
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,190
negative 12y.

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,970
Now, to isolate the y, you can
either multiply both sides by

53
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,710
negative 1/12 or you could say
let's just divide both sides

54
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,180
by negative 12.

55
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,630
Now, because I'm multiplying
or dividing by a negative

56
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,950
number here, I'm going to need
to swap the inequality.

57
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,030
So let me write this.

58
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,690
If I divide both sides of this
equation by negative 12, then

59
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,055
it becomes 27 over negative 12
is less than-- I'm swapping

60
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,900
the inequality, let me do this
in a different color-- is less

61
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,190
than negative 12y over
negative 12.

62
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,280
Notice, when I divide both sides
of the inequality by a

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,150
negative number, I swap the
inequality, the greater than

64
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,950
becomes a less than.

65
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,620
When it was positive, I didn't
have to swap it.

66
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,280
So 27 divided by negative
12, well, they're both

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,520
divisible by 3.

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,850
So we're going to get, if we
divide the numerator and the

69
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,960
denominator by 3, we get
negative 9 over 4 is less

70
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,580
than-- these cancel out-- y.

71
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,260
So y is greater than negative
9/4, or negative 9/4

72
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,220
is less than y.

73
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,740
And if you wanted to write
that-- just let me write

74
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,110
this-- our answer is y is
greater than negative 9/4.

75
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,660
I just swapped the order, you
could say negative 9/4

76
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,870
is less than y.

77
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,590
Or if you want to visualize that
a little bit better, 9/4

78
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,140
is 2 and 1/4, so we could also
say y is greater than negative

79
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,300
2 and 1/4 if we want to put
it as a mixed number.

80
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,410
And if we wanted to graph it
on the number line-- let me

81
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,620
draw a number line right here,
a real simple one.

82
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,820
Maybe this is 0.

83
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,870
Negative 2 is right over, let's
say negative 1, negative

84
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,450
2, then say negative
3 is right there.

85
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,610
Negative 2 and 1/4 is going
to be right here, and it's

86
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,930
greater than, so we're not going
to include that in the

87
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,170
solution set.

88
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,700
So we're going to make an
open circle right there.

89
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,560
And everything larger than that
is a valid y, is a y that

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,450
will satisfy the inequality.

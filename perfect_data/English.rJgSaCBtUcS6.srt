00:00:00,346 --> 00:00:04,009
Welcome to the presentation
on level 4 subtraction.

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,206
Let's get started
with some problems.

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:21,804
First problem I have here
is 33,220 minus 399.

4
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:25,119
So this like we did with, I
believe,

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,455
that we also did borrowing in the level 3
subtraction,

6
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:31,322
we have to go through all of the digits in
the top number

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:35,406
starting with the top right digit and make
sure that

8
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:37,623
they are larger than the digit below it.

9
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:41,953
Because you can only subtract
a smaller number

10
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:42,970
from a larger number.

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,616
You can't do it the other
way, at least,

12
00:00:44,616 --> 00:00:45,793
until we learn negative numbers.

13
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:46,928
So let's go through this and
check to

14
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:48,899
make sure all the top numbers are larger.

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,465
Well immediately, we see no.

16
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:52,812
Well this 0 is not
larger than 9.

17
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:56,077
So we have to borrow
to make the 0 bigger.

18
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,544
So what we do is we borrow
1

19
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:01,229
well some people say we're borrowing a 1.

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,161
Some people say, I mean,
borrowing a 1 from the 10's place

21
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,694
is really
like borrowing a 10.

22
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:09,890
So for simplicity let's just
say we're borrowing a 1.

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,994
So you borrow a 1 from this 2
and this 10

24
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:18,282
will become a,the 0 sorry, will become a 10.

25
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:21,796
And since we borrowed that
1, this 2 will become a 1.

26
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:26,183
We took 1 away from this 2 and
we gave it to the 0 to make 10.

27
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:29,282
We actually took 10 away
from this 2

28
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:30,649
because this 2's in the 10's place.

29
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:31,816
I don't want to
confuse you too much.

30
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:35,584
If just the mechanics of it are
we took 1 away from the 2

31
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:38,283
and we put it in front of
the 0 to make 10.

32
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:40,583
Now let's keep checking.

33
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,267
So now we have a
1 in this place.

34
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,616
1 is smaller than 9, so
we have to borrow again.

35
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:49,950
So we borrow 1 from this 2 now.

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,182
So this 2 now becomes 1.

37
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:56,300
And this 1 will
now become an 11.

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,600
So now we have a 10
is larger than a 9.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,866
11 is larger than a 9.

40
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:05,982
1 is not larger than 3, so
we have to borrow again.

41
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:07,867
This is a good problem.

42
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,726
Maybe I should've warmed you
all up a little bit more.

43
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:11,844
It involves a lot of borrowing.

44
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:14,128
So in order to borrow we do
the same thing over again.

45
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:16,878
This 1 will become 11.

46
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,344
And it's going to borrow from
this 3, which will become a 2.

47
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,511
I think we're done now.

48
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:26,580
10 is larger than 9, 11 is
larger than 9, 11 is larger

49
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,912
than 3, 2 is larger than
nothing,

50
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:29,111
3 is larger than nothing.

51
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,111
So now we're ready to subtract.

52
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:32,579
This is the easy part.

53
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,495
10 minus 9 is 1.

54
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:38,245
11 minus 9 is 2.

55
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:44,462
11 minus 3 is 8.

56
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:47,996
2 minus nothing is 2.

57
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,344
3 minus nothing is 3.

58
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:54,694
So we get 32,821.

59
00:02:54,694 --> 00:03:00,029
The only thing that makes this
harder than just normal subtraction

60
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,402
is that you have to
know how to do the borrowing.

61
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:03,621
And the way I do the borrowing
might be different than the way

62
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,306
you learned in school, but I
think it's easier

63
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:08,253
because you do all of the borrowing at once
instead of switching

64
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:11,103
back and forth between borrowing
and subtracting.

65
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,880
So all we did here, we said
that 0 is less than 9.

66
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,097
Let's borrow 1.

67
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:18,097
The 0 becomes a 10 because
we got this 1 right here.

68
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:22,256
We got this 1 from this 2
and this 2 became a 1.

69
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:25,003
I think you might see the
pattern

70
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,486
if we do a couple of more problems.

71
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,020
So let's do a couple of more.

72
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:46,937
If I had 25,633 ,let's see,minus 578.

73
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:49,151
So name drill.

74
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,569
Start at the top right and we
make sure that

75
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,387
the digits on top are larger than
the digit below it.

76
00:03:55,387 --> 00:04:00,016
Immediately we see 3 is smaller
than 8, so we have to borrow.

77
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,790
So this 3 will become 13.

78
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,072
And then we borrow from this
3, which will now become 2.

79
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:13,482
We took a 1 away from this
3, it became a 2,

80
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,025
and this 1 is right here.

81
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:19,955
13 is now larger than 8, but
2 is now smaller than 7.

82
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,025
So we have to borrow again.

83
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,107
This 2 becomes a 12.

84
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:27,307
And this 6 will become a 5.

85
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:31,874
13 is larger than 8, 12 is
larger than 7,

86
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:36,056
5 is the same as 5, so you can actually
do the subtraction.

87
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,839
Because 5 minus 5 is 0.

88
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,333
As long as the top number's
not smaller

89
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,495
than the number below it.

90
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,459
And then obviously this 5
is larger than this 0

91
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,436
and this 2 is larger than
this nothing here.

92
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,336
So now we're ready to subtract.

93
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:52,943
13 minus 8 is 5.

94
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:57,444
12 minus 7 is 5.

95
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,559
5 minus 5 is 0.

96
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:03,161
5 minus nothing is 5.

97
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,861
Bring down the 2.

98
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:12,194
So the answer is 25,055.

99
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:17,326
So let's do a problem now that
I think will confuse you a little bit more

100
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:20,127
because the
borrowing isn't as easy.

101
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,994
You have to actually borrow
from a couple places.

102
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:38,176
Let's say I had 37,002
minus-- let's say I had 155.

103
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:41,327
So the same drill.

104
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:45,093
So this 2 is less than 5,
so we have to borrow.

105
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,861
So this 2 will become a 12.

106
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,661
But huh, there's a 0 here, so
you can't borrow from the 0.

107
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,577
Some people will let you borrow
from the 0

108
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,210
but I think that just confuses things

109
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,277
because you can't borrow from the 0, there's nothing there.

110
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,961
So instead of borrowing from
the 0 we look to this 0.

111
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,227
Well, there's still
nothing there.

112
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,694
So now we look, oh,
there's a 7 here.

113
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:07,612
So what we do is instead of
borrowing a 1 from the 0,

114
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:14,177
which is hard to do, we borrow 1 from
this 700, from this whole 700.

115
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:17,361
And what is 700 minus 1?

116
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,211
Right, it's 699.

117
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:25,177
So that 700 becomes 699.

118
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,527
Cross all of this out.

119
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,328
And now let's check
our numbers again.

120
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:37,329
12 is larger than 5, nine is
larger than 5, 9 is larger than 1

121
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,579
6 is larger than nothing,
and 3 is larger than nothing,

122
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,912
so we're ready to subtract.

123
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:44,894
12 minus 5 is 7.

124
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,777
9 minus 5 is 4.

125
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:50,644
9 minus 1 is 8.

126
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,645
6 minus nothing is 6.

127
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,028
3 minus nothing is 3.

128
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,345
So there, we're done.

129
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:01,761
The answer is 36,847.

130
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,662
I think we could have time
for one more problem.

131
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:20,094
Let's say I had 3,201
minus-- let's say it's 502.

132
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:22,611
Same drill.

133
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,578
1 is less than 2, so
we have to borrow.

134
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,227
Turn that into an 11.

135
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,569
But you can't borrow from the
0, so you're going to

136
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:31,969
have to borrow from this entire 20.

137
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,520
Well, what's 20 minus 1?

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,004
Right, it's 19.

139
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:38,897
This becomes a 19.

140
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:41,599
so,lets check again

141
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,207
11 is greater than 2.

142
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:44,130
Check.

143
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:45,794
9 is greater than 0.

144
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:46,573
Check.

145
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:47,393
Uh-oh.

146
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,598
1 is not greater than 5.

147
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:50,748
So we have to borrow again.

148
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:52,483
This 1 becomes an 11.

149
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,482
We borrowed from this
3, which becomes a 2.

150
00:07:54,482 --> 00:08:01,287
11 is greater than 2, 9 is
greater than 0, 11 is greater than 5

151
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,136
2 is obviously greater
than nothing below it.

152
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,436
So we're ready to subtract.

153
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,588
11 minus 2 is 9.

154
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,469
9 minus 0 is 9.

155
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,320
11 minus 5 is 6.

156
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,903
And 2 minus nothing is 2.

157
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:25,904
So 3,201 minus 502
is equal to 2,699.

158
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:27,737
I think you're now ready to

159
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:29,453
try some of the level 4 subtraction problems.

160
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:30,686
You just always have to
remember,

161
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,638
do you're borrowing first.

162
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,638
Make sure all the numbers on
top are larger than,

163
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:38,438
or at least as large as all the
numbers on the bottom.

164
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:40,171
And then you can just do your
subtraction

165
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,838
like a normal subtraction problem.

166
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,985
I hope you have some
fun doing this.

167
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:45,320
Talk to you later.

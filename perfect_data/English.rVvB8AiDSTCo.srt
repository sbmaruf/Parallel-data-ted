1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,080
We're all born of the same matter

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,100
However, we're not all born equal

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,150
Who will you be? What will you become?

4
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,150
Some people are born to be leaders, effecting great change amongst their people

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,080
Others are born into mediocrity, living unremarkable lives

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,180
But for some

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:01:00,110
Life will be a constant battle offering zero opportunities

8
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:16,050
So how can nothing... be something?

9
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,030
School was the only place where Zero received attention

10
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,090
He learnt important life lessons like his value in society

11
00:01:25,090 --> 00:02:07,000
And that it was forbidden for his denomination to multiply

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:31,040
Sometimes Zero was made to feel like a much larger number

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:03:05,050
But the children only wanted to remind him that a zero is a zero no matter which way you face

14
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:28,170
As Zero grew into an adult, he walked a lonely path

15
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:49,180
Despite his numerical shortcomings, Zero felt he had something to offer

16
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Zero never allowed bad situations to get him down...

17
00:03:54,180 --> 00:05:41,190
He didnâ€™t want to be a negative number

18
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,190
It was the first time Zero awoke with a battered and bruised body...

19
00:05:46,190 --> 00:06:28,230
But this time was different

20
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,210
For the first time Zero felt unaware of his lowly number

21
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:39,130
In the company of his new friend, he felt as important as a three...

22
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:48,050
Or even a four

23
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,010
But the most wonderful sensation

24
00:06:51,010 --> 00:07:10,160
Was the feeling of belonging

25
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,200
A lifetime of loneliness faded into the past

26
00:07:17,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Along with the notion that their love was forbidden

27
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,080
As the world continued without him

28
00:08:10,080 --> 00:10:27,240
Zero wondered how he could ever continue without his love?

29
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,060
The newborn bore the mark of infinity

30
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:40,150
The largest and most respected number the people had ever seen

31
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,140
Zero knew that for a nothing...

32
00:10:43,140 --> 99:59:59,999
He had created something truly magnificent

1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:03,460
Two weeks ago,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,567
I was sitting at the

3
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:08,567
kitchen table with my wife Katya,

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:13,433
and we were talking about what I was gonna talk about today.

5
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:18,460
We have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,153
doing his math homework.

7
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:22,570
And during a pause in my conversation

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:26,267
with Katya, I looked over at Lincoln

9
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:28,133
and I was suddenly thunderstruck

10
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:33,633
by a recollection of a client of mine.

11
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,525
My client was a guy named Will.

12
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,443
He was from North Texas.

13
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:43,539
He never knew his father very well, because his father left

14
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,233
his mom while she was pregnant with him.

15
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:51,600
And so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom,

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,167
which might have been all right

17
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,333
except that this particular single mom

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,654
was a paranoid schizophrenic,

19
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:03,267
and when Will was five years old she
tried to kill him with a butcher knife.

20
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:05,200
She was

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,335
taken away by authorities and placed in a
psychiatric hospital,

22
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:13,067
and so for the next several years Will
lived with his older brother

23
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,952
until he committed suicide by shooting
himself through the heart.

24
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:19,033
And after that

25
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:22,067
Will bounced around from one family
member to another,

26
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:27,400
until, by the time he was nine years old,
he was essentially living on his own.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,788
That morning that I was sitting with
Katya and Lincoln, I looked at my son,

28
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:35,833
and I realized that when my client, Will,

29
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,900
was his age,

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,933
he'd been living by himself for two years.

31
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,513
Will eventually joined a gang

32
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,860
and committed

33
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,800
a number of very serious crimes,

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,633
including, most seriously of all,

35
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,929
a horrible, tragic murder.

36
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:59,500
And Will was ultimately executed

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,433
as punishment for that crime.

38
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,436
But I don't want to

39
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,108
talk today

40
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:10,357
about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client

41
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:15,367
shouldn't have been executed, but what I would like to do today instead

42
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:18,252
is talk about the death penalty

43
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:20,800
in a way I've never done before,

44
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,100
in a way

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,633
that is entirely noncontroversial.

46
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:27,516
I think that's possible,

47
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:30,233
because there is a corner

48
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,114
of the death penalty debate --

49
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,900
maybe the most important corner --

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,083
where everybody agrees,

51
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:41,033
where the most ardent death penalty supporters

52
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,047
and the most vociferous abolitionists

53
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:47,950
are on exactly the same page.

54
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,665
That's the corner I want to explore.

55
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:55,752
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death

56
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:57,767
penalty case unfolds,

57
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:03,205
and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last 20 years

58
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:05,567
as a death penalty lawyer,

59
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:10,467
from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.

60
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:14,300
You can think of a death penalty case as
a story

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,467
that has four chapters.

62
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:19,733
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same,

63
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,619
and it is tragic.

64
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,725
It begins with the murder

65
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:25,589
of an innocent human being,

66
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,233
and it's followed by a trial

67
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,633
where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row,

68
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,534
and that death sentence is ultimately

69
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,667
upheld by the state appellate court.

70
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:38,593
The second chapter consists of a
complicated legal proceeding known as

71
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,286
a state habeas corpus appeal.

72
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:44,767
The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a

73
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,933
federal habeas corpus proceeding.

74
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,700
And the fourth chapter

75
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,850
is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition,

76
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,984
they might initiate even more complex
litigation,

77
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,333
or they might not do anything at all.

78
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,967
But that fourth chapter always ends

79
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,267
with an execution.

80
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:07,130
When I started representing death row
inmates more than 20 years ago,

81
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,067
people on death row did not have a right
to a lawyer in either the second

82
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,767
or the fourth chapter of this story.

83
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,280
They were on their own.

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,717
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s that they acquired a

85
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,923
right to a lawyer during the third chapter

86
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,757
of the story.

87
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:25,433
So what all of these death row inmates had to do

88
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,433
was rely on volunteer lawyers

89
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,629
to handle their legal proceedings.

90
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,717
The problem is that there were way more
guys on death row

91
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:39,233
than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.

92
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,733
And so inevitably,

93
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:44,433
lawyers drifted to cases that were
already in chapter four --

94
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,667
that makes sense, of course. Those are the
cases that are most urgent;

95
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,333
those are the guys who are closest to being executed.

96
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,522
Some of these lawyers were successful; they managed to get new trials for their clients.

97
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:58,467
Others of them managed to extend
the lives of their clients, sometimes by

98
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,467
years, sometimes by months.

99
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,567
But the one thing that didn't happen

100
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:07,400
was that there was never a serious and
sustained decline in the number of

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,800
annual executions in Texas.

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,567
In fact, as you can see from this graph,
from the time that the Texas execution

103
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,900
apparatus got efficient in the mid- to
late-1990s,

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,233
there've only been a couple of years where
the number of annual executions dipped

105
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,400
below 20.

106
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,940
In a typical year in Texas,

107
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,192
we're averaging about

108
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,864
two people a month.

109
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:33,500
In some years in Texas, we've executed
close to 40 people, and this number

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,222
has never significantly declined over
the last 15 years.

111
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:41,867
And yet, at the same time that we
continue to execute

112
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,967
about the same number of people every
year,

113
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,535
the number of people who we're sentencing
to death

114
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,696
on an annual basis

115
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:50,180
has dropped rather steeply.

116
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,567
So we have this paradox,

117
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:56,287
which is that the number of annual
executions has remained high

118
00:05:56,287 --> 00:06:00,722
but the number of new death sentences
has gone down.

119
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:02,000
Why is that?

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,767
It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate,

121
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,600
because the murder rate has not declined

122
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,867
nearly so steeply as the red line on
that graph has gone down.

123
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,733
What has happened instead is

124
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,567
that juries have started to sentence
more and more people to prison

125
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:21,067
for the rest of their lives without the
possibility of parole,

126
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:24,383
rather than sending them to the
execution chamber.

127
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,733
Why has that happened?

128
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:31,140
it hasn't happened because of a
dissolution of popular support

129
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,700
for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact

130
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,360
that death penalty support in Texas is at
an all-time low.

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,367
Do you know what all-time low in Texas
means?

132
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,933
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.

133
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:47,667
Now that's really good compared to the
mid 1980s, when it was in

134
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,391
excess of 80 percent,

135
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:53,800
but we can't explain the decline in
death sentences and the affinity for

136
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,667
life without the possibility of parole
by an erosion of support for the death

137
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,133
penalty, because people still support the
death penalty.

138
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,207
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?

139
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,833
What's happened is

140
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,738
that lawyers

141
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:09,433
who represent death row inmates have
shifted their focus

142
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:13,935
to earlier and earlier chapters of the
death penalty story.

143
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:17,200
So 25 years ago, they focused on
chapter four.

144
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,063
And they went from chapter four 25 years ago to chapter three

145
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:22,767
in the late 1980s.

146
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,167
And they went from chapter three in the
late 1980s to chapter two in

147
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:29,367
the mid-1990s. And beginning
in the mid- to late-1990s,

148
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,557
they began to focus on chapter one of
the story.

149
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:36,567
Now you might think that this decline in
death sentences and the increase in the

150
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,033
number of life sentences is a good thing
or a bad thing.

151
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,589
I don't want to have a conversation about that
today.

152
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,747
All that I want to tell you is that the
reason that this has happened

153
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:47,859
is because death penalty lawyers have
understood

154
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,633
that the earlier you intervene in a
case,

155
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:55,133
the greater the likelihood that you're
going to save your client's life.

156
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,000
That's the first thing I've learned.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,935
Here's the second thing I learned:

158
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:00,100
My client Will

159
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,556
was not the exception to the rule;

160
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:06,633
he was the rule.

161
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:10,167
I sometimes say, if you tell me the name
of a death row inmate --

162
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,215
doesn't matter what state he's in, doesn't matter if I've ever met him before --

163
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,833
I'll write his biography for you.

164
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,033
And eight out of 10 times,

165
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,667
the details of that biography

166
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,130
will be more or less accurate.

167
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,133
And the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row are

168
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:31,100
people who came from the same sort of
dysfunctional family that Will did.

169
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,068
Eighty percent of the people on death row

170
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:35,200
are people who had exposure

171
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,833
to the juvenile justice system.

172
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,964
That's the second lesson

173
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:41,767
that I've learned.

174
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,167
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner

175
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,313
where everybody's going to agree.

176
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:50,506
People in this room might disagree

177
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:52,619
about whether Will should have been
executed,

178
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,133
but I think everybody would agree

179
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,833
that the best possible version of his story

180
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,167
would be a story

181
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:04,949
where no murder ever occurs.

182
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,933
How do we do that?

183
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:10,963
When our son Lincoln was working on that
math problem

184
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:14,005
two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.

185
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:17,488
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem,

186
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:21,400
sometimes the solution is to slice it
into smaller problems.

187
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,967
That's what we do for most problems -- in
math and physics, even in social policy --

188
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,733
we slice them into smaller, more
manageable problems.

189
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,468
But every once in a while,

190
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:32,500
as Dwight Eisenhower said,

191
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,020
the way you solve a problem

192
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,100
is to make it bigger.

193
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,033
The way we solve this problem

194
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:43,889
is to make the issue of the death
penalty bigger.

195
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,133
We have to say, all right.

196
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,394
We have these four chapters

197
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:51,233
of a death penalty story,

198
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,000
but what happens before

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,127
that story begins?

200
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:59,933
How can we intervene in the life of a murderer

201
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,600
before he's a murderer?

202
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,949
What options do we have

203
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:06,333
to nudge that person

204
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,567
off of the path

205
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:11,730
that is going to lead to a result that
everybody --

206
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,586
death penalty supporters and death penalty
opponents --

207
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,333
still think

208
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,767
is a bad result:

209
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,333
the murder of an innocent human being?

210
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,933
You know, sometimes people say

211
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,173
that something

212
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,300
isn't rocket science.

213
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,633
And by that, what they mean is rocket
science is really complicated

214
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:35,135
and this problem that we're talking
about now is really simple.

215
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,567
Well that's rocket science;

216
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,367
that's the mathematical expression

217
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,233
for the thrust created by a rocket.

218
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,600
What we're talking about today

219
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,001
is just as complicated.

220
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,625
What we're talking about today is also

221
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,272
rocket science.

222
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,083
My client Will

223
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,753
and 80 percent of the people on
death row

224
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:00,200
had five chapters in their lives

225
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,733
that came before

226
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,533
the four chapters of the death penalty
story.

227
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:08,300
I think of these five chapters as points
of intervention,

228
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,167
places in their lives when our society

229
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:16,100
could've intervened in their lives and
nudged them off of the path that they were on

230
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,368
that created a consequence that we all -- death penalty supporters or death

231
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,086
penalty opponents --

232
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,106
say was a bad result.

233
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,733
Now, during each of these five
chapters:

234
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,367
when his mother was pregnant with him;

235
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,633
in his early childhood years;

236
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,500
when he was in elementary school;

237
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,667
when he was in middle school and then high
school;

238
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:38,167
and when he was in the juvenile justice
system -- during each of those five chapters,

239
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,382
there were a wide variety of things that society could have done.

240
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,500
In fact, if we just imagine

241
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,600
that there are five different modes of
intervention, the way that society could intervene

242
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,484
in each of those five chapters,

243
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:52,700
and we could mix and match them any way
we want,

244
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,870
there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 -- possible strategies

245
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,733
that we could embrace in order to nudge
kids like Will

246
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,567
off of the path that they're on.

247
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,322
So I'm not standing here today

248
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,400
with the solution.

249
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,933
But the fact that we still have a lot to learn,

250
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:15,306
that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.

251
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:18,200
We know from experience in other states

252
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,867
that there are a wide variety of modes
of intervention

253
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:25,755
that we could be using in Texas, and in
every other state that isn't using them,

254
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:30,748
in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.

255
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:33,371
I'll just mention a few.

256
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:37,296
I won't talk today about reforming the
legal system.

257
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:42,067
That's probably a topic that is best
reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.

258
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,887
Instead, let me talk about a couple of
modes of intervention

259
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:48,255
that we can all help accomplish,

260
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,740
because they are modes of intervention
that will come about

261
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,700
when legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens,

262
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,933
agree that that's what we ought to be
doing

263
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,267
and that's how we ought to be spending our money.

264
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,653
We could be providing early childhood care

265
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:07,467
for economically disadvantaged and
otherwise troubled kids,

266
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,850
and we could be doing it for free.

267
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,960
And we could be nudging kids like Will
off of the path that we're on.

268
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,800
There are other states that do that, but we don't.

269
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,901
We could be providing special schools, at
both the high school level

270
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,268
and the middle school level, but even in K-5,

271
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:29,657
that target economically and otherwise
disadvantaged kids, and particularly kids

272
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:30,833
who have had exposure

273
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,933
to the juvenile justice system.

274
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,800
There are a handful of states that do that;

275
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,482
Texas doesn't.

276
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,300
There's one other thing we can be doing --

277
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,638
well, there are a bunch of other things that we could be doing -- there's one other thing that we could be

278
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:44,200
doing that I'm going to mention, and this is
gonna be the only controversial thing

279
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,833
that I say today.

280
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,133
We could be intervening

281
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,233
much more aggressively

282
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,457
into dangerously dysfunctional homes,

283
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,300
and getting kids out of them

284
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,771
before their moms pick up butcher knives
and threaten to kill them.

285
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,791
If we're gonna do that,

286
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,867
we need a place to put them.

287
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:08,271
Even if we do all of those things, some
kids are going to fall through the cracks

288
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:11,867
and they're going to end up in that last
chapter before the murder story begins,

289
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,900
they're going to end up in the juvenile
justice system.

290
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,002
And even if that happens,

291
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,906
it's not yet too late.

292
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:21,700
There's still time to nudge them,

293
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,457
if we think about nudging them

294
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,826
rather than just punishing them.

295
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,566
There are two professors in the Northeast --
one at Yale and one at Maryland  --

296
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,333
they set up a school

297
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,233
that is attached to a juvenile prison.

298
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,482
And the kids are in prison, but they go
to school from eight in the morning

299
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:39,167
until four in the afternoon.

300
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,803
Now, it was logistically difficult.

301
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:41,967
They had to recruit teachers

302
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:45,333
who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict

303
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,535
separation between the people who work
at the school and the prison authorities,

304
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:51,967
and most dauntingly of all, they needed
to invent a new curriculum because

305
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:52,967
you know what?

306
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:58,467
People don't come into and out of prison
on a semester basis.

307
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:01,584
But they did all those things.

308
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,333
Now what do all of these things have in common?

309
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:10,700
What all of these things have in common
is that they cost money.

310
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,728
Some of the people in the room might be
old enough to remember

311
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:17,490
the guy on the old oil filter commercial.

312
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,300
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now

313
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,367
or you can pay me later."

314
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,500
What we're doing

315
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,520
in the death penalty system

316
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,119
is we're paying later.

317
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,967
But the thing is

318
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,833
that for every 15,000 dollars
that we spend intervening

319
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:42,200
in the lives of economically and
otherwise disadvantaged kids

320
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,520
in those earlier chapters,

321
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,933
we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.

322
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,696
Even if you don't agree

323
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,092
that there's a moral imperative that we do it,

324
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:56,012
it just makes economic sense.

325
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,612
I want to tell you about the last conversation that
I had with Will.

326
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:06,700
It was the day that he was going to be executed,

327
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,012
and we were just talking.

328
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,067
There was nothing left to do

329
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,682
in his case.

330
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,033
And we were talking about his life.

331
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,900
And he was talking first about his dad,
who he hardly knew,

332
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,733
who had died,

333
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,367
and then about his mom,

334
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,131
who he did know,

335
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,300
who is still alive.

336
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,000
And I said to him,

337
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,051
"I know the story.

338
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:32,867
I've read the records.

339
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,509
I know that she tried to kill you."

340
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:37,947
I said, "But I've always wondered whether you
really

341
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,067
actually remember that."

342
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,570
I said, "I don't remember anything

343
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,729
from when I was five years old.

344
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,667
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you."

345
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,167
And he looked at me and he leaned forward,

346
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:52,767
and he said, "Professor," -- he'd known me for
12 years, he still called me Professor.

347
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,082
He said, "Professor, I don't mean any
disrespect by this,

348
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,733
but when your mama

349
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,833
picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger
than you are,

350
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,633
and chases you through the house
screaming she's gonna kill you,

351
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:08,458
and you have to lock yourself in the
bathroom and lean against the door and

352
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,221
holler for help until the police get
there,"

353
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:14,300
he looked at me and he said,

354
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,800
"that's something you don't forget."

355
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,300
I hope there's one thing you all won't forget:

356
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,156
In between the time you arrived here
this morning and the time we break for lunch,

357
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:26,567
there are going to be four homicides

358
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,000
in the United States.

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,167
We're going to devote enormous social
resources to punishing the people who

360
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,467
commit those crimes, and that's
appropriate, because we should punish

361
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,533
people who do bad things.

362
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,100
But three of those crimes are
preventable.

363
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,010
If we make the picture bigger

364
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:47,816
and devote our attention to the
earlier chapters,

365
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,200
then we're never going to write the
first sentence

366
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,994
that begins the death penalty story.

367
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,700
Thank you.

368
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,031
(Applause)

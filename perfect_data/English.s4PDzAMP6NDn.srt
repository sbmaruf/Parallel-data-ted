1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
By the end of this year,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that actively use social networking sites.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The one thing that all of them have in common

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is that they're going to die.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I think it has some really profound implications

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that are worth exploring.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What first got me thinking about this

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
who was a science and technology journalist

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
who died of cancer.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that went out shortly after he died.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He said, "Here it is. I'm dead,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and this is my last post to my blog.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
from the punishments of my cancer,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the first part of the process

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of turning this from an active website to an archive."

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, while as a journalist,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Miller's archive may have been better written

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and more carefully curated than most,

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the fact of the matter is that all of us today

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
are creating an archive

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that's something completely different

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
than anything that's been created

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
by any previous generation.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Consider a few stats for a moment.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Right now there are 48 hours of video

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And the average Facebook user

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is creating 90 pieces of content each month.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
at best they may have created

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
some photos or home videos,

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
years after we're gone.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
for technologists.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
so what I'd like to do briefly

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is paint a picture

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
of what the present and the future are going to look like.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now we're already seeing some services

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that are designed to let us decide

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
after we die.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
One of them actually, fittingly enough,

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
found me when I checked into a deli

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
at a restaurant in New York

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
on foursquare.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Death: Adam?

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
AO: Yeah.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
even at the Organic.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AO: Who is this?

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Death: Go to ifidie.net

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
before it's too late.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
(Laughter)

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So what that service does, quite simply,

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
is let you create a message or a video

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that can be posted to Facebook after you die.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Another service right now

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
is called 1,000 Memories.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
complete with photos and videos and stories

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that they can post after you die.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But what I think comes next is far more interesting.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
who, back in March,

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I think as machines' ability

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
to understand human language and process vast amounts of data

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
continues to improve,

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it's going to become possible

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to analyze an entire life's worth of content --

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that we're producing in such massive numbers.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I think as that happens,

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
it's going to become possible for our digital personas

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and technology's ability to make sense of it all.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
One service called My Next Tweet

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to make some predictions as to what you might say next.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well right now, as you can see,

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the results can be somewhat comical.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can imagine what something like this might look like

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
five, 10 or 20 years from now

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
as our technical capabilities improve.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Taking it a step further,

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
MIT's media lab is working on robots

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
that can interact more like humans.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But what if those robots were able to interact

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
based on the unique characteristics of a specific person

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that person produces in their lifetime?

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Finally, think back to this famous scene

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
from election night 2008

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
back in the United States,

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
where CNN beamed a live hologram

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
for an interview with Anderson Cooper.

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What if we were able to use that same type of technology

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
interacting in a very lifelike way

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
based on all the content they created while they were alive?

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think that's going to become completely possible

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
as the amount of data we're producing

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and technology's ability to understand it

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
both expand exponentially.

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is if we want that to become our reality --

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and if so,

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thank you very much.

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
(Applause)

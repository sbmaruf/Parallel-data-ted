1
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:01,665
In this video, I
really just want

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,280
to introduce you
to some terminology

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,380
for some basic angle types.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,010
And the terminology I
want to introduce you to

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:20,410
are acute angles, right
angles, and obtuse angles.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,190
And I think when we
just go through these,

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,660
they'll be pretty
self-explanatory.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,380
An acute angle is an
angle-- well, let me just

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,210
draw them first.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,230
Then it might start
to make sense.

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,509
So an acute angle will
look something like that.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,850
I draw two rays that are
coming from a common point.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,070
So the acute angle will be
this angle right over here.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,590
I could also draw an
acute angle, maybe

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,160
an angle that's formed from
the intersection of two lines.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,200
This angle will be acute,
and so will this angle.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,890
They're both acute angles.

18
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:55,064
And we're going to see is
acute angles are ones that

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,120
are-- since I haven't defined
right angles yet-- they're

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,620
narrower.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,410
And what we're going
to see is that they're

22
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:01,761
smaller than right angles.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,770
Right angles are when the
rays or the lines are going,

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,520
I guess, in the-- I don't
want to use the word, right,

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,650
in my definition-- but if
one is going horizontal,

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,460
the other one will
be going vertical.

27
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:19,037
So let me draw it
with the rays first.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,410
So the right angle, this
one's going from the left

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,220
to the right.

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,570
Then the other ray is going
from the bottom to the top.

31
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,330
This angle right over
here is a right angle.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,670
And I could label it like
that, as a traditional angle.

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,560
But the general convention
for labeling right angles

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,940
is to put a little, kind of a
half of a box right over there.

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,080
And that means that
is a right angle.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,770
Or that if this is
going left to right,

37
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,910
this is going perfectly
top to bottom,

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,360
that this is in no way kind of--
I guess the best way to think

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,150
about it and why
it's called right

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,140
is that this ray is
completely upright, compared

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,130
to this ray over here.

42
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,860
And let me draw it
with some lines.

43
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,090
So if I have one line
like this and then I

44
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,500
have another line like
that, a right angle

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,230
over here-- actually
all of these

46
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,090
would have to be right angles--
it would mean that this line is

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,860
completely-- if
this was the ground,

48
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,590
this line is completely
upright, relative to this line

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,090
over here.

50
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,010
So either of these, that's
what a right angle means.

51
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,860
And now that we've
defined right angle,

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,400
I can give you another
definition for an acute angle.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,250
An acute angle has a
measure, or it's smaller,

54
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,080
than a right angle.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,710
When you learn about
radians and degrees, which

56
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,510
are different ways
to measure angles,

57
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,950
you'll see that a right angle
can be measured as 90 degrees.

58
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,070
This over here is
less than 90 degrees.

59
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,180
So this is less than 90 degrees.

60
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,690
And one way to
conceptualize this

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,570
is that this angle, its opening
is smaller, it's more narrow,

62
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,520
the lines are-- you would
have to rotate one line less

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,650
to get to the other line
than you would over here.

64
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,130
Here, you'd have to move
it all the way over there.

65
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,180
Here, you'd only have
to move it a little bit.

66
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,950
So the acute angle is
less than a right angle.

67
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,180
And so you might imagine
already what an obtuse angle is.

68
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,370
It is greater than
a right angle.

69
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,500
So let me draw a couple of
examples of obtuse angles.

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,440
So an obtuse angle
might look like-- let

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,930
me make it a little bit clearer.

72
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,850
It might look like that.

73
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,730
If this was a right
angle, this line over here

74
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,550
would look something like that.

75
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,940
It would be completely
upright relative to this

76
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,120
if this were the ground.

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,680
But we don't see that.

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,130
This orange ray over here is
actually opened out wider.

79
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,930
It's opened up wider.

80
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,910
So it is obtuse.

81
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,860
And this kind of comes from
the actual everyday meaning.

82
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,910
Acute means very sharp
or very sensitive.

83
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,940
Obtuse means not very sharp
or not very sensitive.

84
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,800
So you could imagine this looks
like a sharp point or it's not

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,510
opening up much, so maybe
it's more sensitive relative

86
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,960
to other things,
or I don't know.

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,590
I'm just trying to
make connections.

88
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,040
This is less sensitive.

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,380
It's all big and open.

90
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,960
It won't be able
to notice things

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,070
that are small
because I don't know.

92
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,930
Maybe that's not an
appropriate analogy.

93
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,020
But one way to think about it,
it's kind of open up wider,

94
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,259
or it's bigger
than a right angle.

95
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,820
It's larger than 90
degrees if you measure it.

96
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,000
You would have to
rotate this ray more

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,220
to get to this other ray
than you would if they were

98
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,280
right angles, and
definitely a lot more than

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,860
if they were acute angles.

100
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,580
If I were to draw this with
lines, which of the angles

101
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,250
are obtuse and which are acute?

102
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,400
Well, the way I've drawn
them right over here,

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,720
these two over here are acute,
and then these over here

104
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,760
are going to be obtuse.

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,860
This one and this one, these
are both obtuse angles.

106
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,980
And I actually drew
it up here, as well.

107
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,160
This one and this one
are going to be obtuse.

108
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,460
So very simple idea.

109
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,250
If one line or one ray
relative to the other one

110
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,540
is straight up and down,
versus to left and right,

111
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,560
or is completely
upright, then we're

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,150
talking about a right angle.

113
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:21,766
If they're closer to
each other, if you

114
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,350
have to rotate them less, you're
talking about an acute angle.

115
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:26,003
If you have to rotate
them more, you're

116
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,251
talking about an object angle.

117
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,250
And I think when you just
look at them visually,

118
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:32,329
it's pretty easy to pick out.

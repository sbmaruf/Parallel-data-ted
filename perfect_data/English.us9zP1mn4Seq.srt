1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,535
We are asked, what number set
does the number 8 belong to?

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:05,910
So this is actually
a good review

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,180
of the different sets of numbers
that we often talk about.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,129
So the first set
under consideration

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,730
is the natural numbers.

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,740

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,729
And these are essentially
the counting numbers,

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,070
and you're not counting 0.

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,050
So just if you were
actually to count objects,

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,630
and you have at
least one of them,

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,296
we're talking about
the natural numbers.

13
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:30,400
So that would be 1, 2,
3, so on and so forth.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
So clearly, 8 is
a natural number.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,250
You can count up to 8 here.

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,270
You could count 8 objects.

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,960
So 8 is a member of
the natural numbers.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,950

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,360
The next one we
should consider, let's

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:54,070
consider the whole
numbers right over here.

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,880
And I should say
natural numbers.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,560
So let's consider
the whole numbers.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,934
The whole numbers
are essentially

24
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,650
the same thing as
the natural numbers,

25
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,860
but we're now
going to include 0.

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,260
So this is 0, 1, 2,
3, so on and so forth.

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,400
So clearly, 8 is one
of these as well.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,990
You could eventually
increment your way to 8,

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,240
like you're just counting
all of the whole numbers.

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,179
Another way to view this is
the non-negative numbers.

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,530
So 8 clearly belongs
to this as well.

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,100
So let's expand our
set a little bit.

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,225
Let's think about integers.

34
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:31,280

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,430
Now these are all the
numbers starting with,

36
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,700
well you could keep counting
down, all the way up

37
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,780
to negative 3, negative
2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3,

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,300
and you could just
keep going there.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,187
Now clearly, 8 is
one of these as well.

40
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,520
You can just keep counting to 8.

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,520
In fact, let me just
put our check box there.

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,700
In general, you
have your integers

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,850
that contain both the positive
and the negative numbers and 0,

44
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,539
depending on
whether you consider

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,720
that positive or
negative, or neither.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,970
So that's the integers,
right over here.

47
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,465
And then the whole numbers
is a subset of the integers.

48
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:13,995

49
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,370
So I'll draw it like this.

50
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,010
The whole numbers
are right over here,

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,170
that is the whole numbers.

52
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,589
We've now excluded all
of the negative numbers.

53
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,540
So these are all the
non-negative numbers.

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,019
All the non-negative
integers, I should say.

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,490
So these are the whole numbers.

56
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,020
And then the natural numbers
are a subset of that.

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,380
It's essentially everything.

58
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,380
So the only thing that's
in whole numbers that's

59
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,560
not in the natural numbers
is just the number 0.

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,710
So this whole area
right here just

61
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,340
corresponds to the number 0.

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,270
So it really should
be a bit of a point.

63
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,270
So let me make it clear.

64
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,180

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,330
This circle is
the whole numbers,

66
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,040
and then I have the
natural numbers,

67
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,519
which is a subset of that.

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,490
Obviously this isn't
drawn to scale.

69
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,210
The natural numbers
is a subset of that.

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,610
8 is a member of all of them.

71
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,630
8 is sitting right over here.

72
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,000
So it's a member of the
natural numbers, whole numbers,

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,365
and the integers.

74
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,160
Now let's keep expanding things.

75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,995
Let's talk about
rational numbers.

76
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:17,510

77
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,239
Now these are numbers that
can be expressed in the form p

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,090
over q, where both p
and q are integers.

79
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,330
So can 8 be expressed this way?

80
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:37,420
Well, you can express
8 as 8 over 1.

81
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,459
Or actually 16 over 2.

82
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,620
Or you could just
keep going, 32 over 4,

83
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,140
you can express it as a
bunch of p's over q's, where

84
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,070
both the p and q are integers.

85
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,140
So it's definitely
a rational number.

86
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,739
And in fact, all of these things
over here are rational numbers.

87
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,940
So let me draw.

88
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,940
So this is all a subset
of rational numbers.

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,130
So 8 is definitely a
member of that as well.

90
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,920
Rational numbers, so let me
put the check box over here.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,329
Now what about
irrational numbers?

92
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,900
Irrational numbers.

93
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,560
Well, by definition, these are
numbers that are not rational.

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,050
These are numbers that cannot
be expressed in this form,

95
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,959
where p and q are integers.

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,880
So if something is rational,
it just cannot be irrational.

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,110
So 8 is not a member of
the irrational numbers.

98
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,900
The irrational numbers are
just a completely separate set

99
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,039
over here.

100
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,980
So I would draw it like this.

101
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,700
This area right over
here, this would

102
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,150
be the irrational numbers.

103
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,349
Irrational.

104
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,350
Rational is not a subset of
irrational, they are exclusive.

105
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,800
You can't be in both sets.

106
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,830
So that's irrational
right over there.

107
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,996
And then finally let's ask, is
8 a member of the real numbers?

108
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:55,080
Now the real numbers are
essentially all of these.

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,810
It's combining both the
rational and the irrational.

110
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,590
So the real numbers is all
of this right over here.

111
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,270
And so 8 is clearly
a member of the real.

112
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,609
It's a member of the
real, and within the real,

113
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,310
you either can be rational or
irrational, 8 it is rational.

114
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,070
It's an integer.

115
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,490
It's a whole number.

116
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,010
And it is a natural number.

117
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,909
So it's definitely a
member of the reals.

118
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:19,450
And just to give
you might be saying,

119
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,130
hey well, what is an
irrational number then?

120
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,260
Can't almost every number
be represented like this?

121
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,980
Or every number you can think
of be represented like this?

122
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,480
And an example of maybe
the most famous example

123
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,890
of an irrational number is pi.

124
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,599
Pi is equal to 3.14159, and
people devote their lives

125
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,490
to memorizing the digits of pi.

126
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,330
But what makes this irrational
is you can't represent it

127
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,130
as a ratio, or as a
rational expression,

128
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,890
of integers, the way you
can for rational numbers.

129
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,650
And this right here
is non-repeating.

130
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,589

131
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,130
And if it was
repeating, you actually

132
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,310
could express it as
a ratio of integers,

133
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,000
and we do that in other videos.

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,960
It is non-repeating
and non terminating,

135
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,664
so you never run out digits to
the right of the decimal point.

136
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,830
So this would be an example
of an irrational number.

137
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,190
So pi would sit here
in the irrationals.

138
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,870
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,895

3
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,270
SPEAKER 1: I think
it's important

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,760
that people look at art because
we live in a visual world.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,510
And understanding,
and looking at,

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,750
and thinking about
the way images

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,890
communicate in all kinds of
ways is important to being alive

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,990
today.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,040
SPEAKER 2: If one has
heightened visual acumen, which

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,870
you get from spending time
looking at things, whether it's

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,620
looking at newspaper
photos closely,

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,240
or looking at works in
a museum, or looking

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,100
at your surroundings,
or birds more closely,

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,620
that sort of attention
to an environment

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,920
makes you a better person.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,116
You are existing in a more
aware, alert, present space.

17
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:47,490
SPEAKER 3: Sometimes
people think

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,070
that the only way
of looking at art

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,720
is going to museums
and places like that.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,150
But maybe sometimes art is
everywhere, in the street,

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,640
if you look at architectural
places, or everything.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,080
So you really don't need to
go to a museum to see art.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,450
It could be anywhere, in a
park, or looking at buildings,

24
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,050
or going to a movie.

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,750
So I think that's everyday life.

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,660
SPEAKER 4: It's all
about noticing for me.

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,690
It's all about trying to see
beyond the first impression.

28
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,660
People look at art.

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,081
And they'd say, I like this.

30
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:14,830
I don't like this.

31
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,880
And they move on.

32
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,350
They have predetermined notions.

33
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,480
But if you can just
stop and take a breath

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,197
and look a little
deeper at something,

35
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,280
you can really start to
notice some kind of detail

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,927
that you might have
not noticed before.

37
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:27,260
And I think that skill applies
to so many things in life

38
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,000
aside from art,
about being able just

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,660
to slow down and be aware of
actually where you're standing.

40
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,880
And just even stop talking, and
just maybe open up your ears,

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,570
for example.

42
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,660
There's so much
detail around that you

43
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,090
can absorb if you really
just take a moment,

44
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,490
and just let it
come in, and listen.

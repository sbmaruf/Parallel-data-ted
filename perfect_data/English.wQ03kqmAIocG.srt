1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,260
The perimeter of a rectangular
fence measures 0.72 kilometers.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,480
The length of the fenced
area is 160 meters.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,260
What is it's width?

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,150
Now, the first thing
that jumps out at me,

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,650
and it might have
jumped out at you,

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,400
is that they're giving
us different units.

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,099
They're giving us the perimeter
in terms of kilometers,

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,350
and they're giving us the
length in terms of meters.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,890
And I'm assuming that they want
the width in terms of meters,

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,991
since that's what they're
giving us the length in.

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,740
So what I want to do
right from the get go

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,240
is just convert the
perimeter into meters.

13
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:32,856
So we have the
perimeter, and I'll just

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,770
represent that with a p, is
equal to 0.72 kilometers.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,290
Which I'll write km for short.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,300
Kilometers, 1,000 meters.

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,240
That's what the
prefix kilo- means.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,590
And so we can say that
for every 1 kilometer

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,780
we have 1,000 meters.

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,700
Or we have 1,000 meters
per every 1 kilometer.

21
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,066
And you might say
Sal, how do you

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,260
know to multiply by 1,000,
instead of divide by 1,000?

23
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:01,385
And one way to think about
it, and this is probably

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,250
the best way to think
about it, is just look,

25
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:06,514
a kilometer is a
bunch of meters.

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,450
It's actually 1,000 meters.

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,620
So if I'm converting
kilometers into meters,

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,390
I should have a
much larger number.

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,060
Whatever my number
is in kilometers,

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,660
it must be a much
larger number of meters.

31
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,440
So that's what tells
you to multiply.

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,980
And also, if you care
about dimensional analysis,

33
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,010
the dimensions
cancel out here too.

34
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,350
We have kilometers in
the numerator, kilometers

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,650
in the denominator.

36
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,800
And so when you multiply it, you
have 0.72 times 1,000 meters.

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,670
And to multiply
anything times 1,000,

38
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,120
or really any power
of 10, you say, look,

39
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,280
if I multiply it by 10,
I'll move the decimal

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,060
to the right one space.

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,890
That'd be multiplying it
by 10, it would be 7.2.

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,800
Multiplying it by
100 would give us 72.

43
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,420
If we're multiplying by
1,000, that would give us 720.

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,870
And I'll put a trailing
0 here, just so

45
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,630
that we have something
to move to the right of.

46
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,230
So this is going to be
equal to 720 meters.

47
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,320
So that is the perimeter.

48
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,740
Now let's remind ourselves
what the perimeter even is.

49
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,530
And then hopefully we
can figure out the width.

50
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,010
So let me draw a
little box over here.

51
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,500
And they tell us that
the length is 160 meters.

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,050
So let's say that's this
dimension right over here.

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,330
The length is 160 meters.

54
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,340
So that would be this dimension
and this, it's a rectangle.

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,110
So these sides are
both the same length.

56
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,140
And our width is what
we need to solve for.

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,640
So that's our width, and
this is also our width.

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,190
And the perimeter is the
measure going around it.

59
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,130
So the perimeter is going to be
this length, plus this width,

60
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,300
plus that same length again,
plus that width over there.

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,160
Or another way to think
about it-- and this

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,490
might be a simpler
way-- so there's

63
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,240
a couple of ways you
could think about it.

64
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,050
You could say that
the perimeter is

65
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,840
equal to the length
plus the width,

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,260
plus the length plus the width.

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,860
And then we know
what the length is.

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,260
So the perimeter would be equal
to 160 meters plus the width.

69
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,270
Actually, let me
write the units down.

70
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,750
160 meters plus the width,
plus 160 meters plus the width.

71
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,990
And then we know what
know the perimeter is,

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,860
that's actually 720 meters.

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,730
So 720 meters is the perimeter.

74
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,140
So you would get 720
meters is equal to 160

75
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,340
meters, plus the width, plus
160 meters plus the width.

76
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,800
Now there's a bunch of different
ways to solve for the width.

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,890
One way, you could
just say, look,

78
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:40,564
if I just have the
width plus the length

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,740
once, that's going to add
up to half of the perimeter.

80
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,230
So if I just go halfway
around the rectangle,

81
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,550
that's going to add up
to half the perimeter.

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,130
So if I take my width, which
is w, plus my length, which

83
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:02,170
is 160 meters, this should be
equal to 1/2 of the perimeter.

84
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,920
This should be equal to 1/2
times our perimeter, which

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,230
is 720 meters.

86
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,100
Or you get width plus 160 meters
is equal to 1/2 times 720,

87
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:21,020
or 720 divided by
2 is 360 meters.

88
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,359
And so now you have
a situation where

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,940
we have the width plus
160 meters is 360 meters.

90
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,520
So we could now subtract
360 from both sides.

91
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,580
Or sorry, we could subtract
160 from both sides

92
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,260
to solve for it.

93
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,800
Or you could even
do it in your head.

94
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,771
If I say something plus 160 is
360, you could, in your head,

95
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,490
say well, that
something must be 200.

96
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,010
200 plus 160 is 360.

97
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,390
So you could just say
your width is 200 meters.

98
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,780
Or if you want to do it a
little bit more formally,

99
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,280
you could say look,
subtract 160 meters

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,020
from both sides
of this equation.

101
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,240
And you are left with the
width is equal to 200 meters.

102
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,356
So that's one way to do it.

103
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,600
We've solved the problem.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,100
The other way is,
you could actually

105
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,710
go straight from this equation.

106
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,120
So we get 720.

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,190
I'm just going to assume
everything is in meters.

108
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,980
720.

109
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,450
160 meters plus
160 meters is 320.

110
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,690
And that's going to
be the same thing

111
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,950
as the width plus the width.

112
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,370
Or 2 times the width.

113
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,910
Anything plus itself is
just 2 times that anything.

114
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,010
Now if this plus 320 is equal to
720, you could do in your head.

115
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,550
You could say well,
what plus 320 is 720?

116
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,540
Well, this thing
must be equal to 400.

117
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:44,915
Or you could do
it more formally,

118
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,720
and subtract 320 from
both sides of this.

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
And you would get--
if you subtract 320

120
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,990
from here-- you would
get 400 is equal to,

121
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,850
subtract 320 from this side,
you get 2 times the width.

122
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,120
So if I have 2 times
something is equal to 400,

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,170
that something must be 200.

124
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,709
Or if we want to do
it more formally,

125
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,830
you could divide both sides
of this equation by 2.

126
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,240
Either way, you will get the
width is equal to 200 meters.

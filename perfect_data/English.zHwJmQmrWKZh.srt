1
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:07,967
SPEAKER 1: We're here
in the British Museum,

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,810
and we're looking at the head
of Augustus from about 27 or 25

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,310
BC.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,360
SPEAKER 2: So who's Augustus?

5
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,861
SPEAKER 1: Well,
Augustus of course,

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,910
became the first emperor.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,200
He, of course, was part
of the triumvirate.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,740
So lots of people know the story
of Mark Antony and Cleopatra

9
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:21,861
through Shakespeare etc.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,380
And, of course, he defeated
Antony at the Battle of Actium,

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,670
and that was when he was
able to assume the position.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,420
He didn't become
Augustus until later

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,190
on when he finally defeated
all the other rivals.

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,999
SPEAKER 2: So he goes
from being Octavian,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
who's one of three in charge of
Rome, to defeating his rivals,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,110
including Antony, and--

17
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:40,784
SPEAKER 1: He's given
the name Augustus.

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,450
It's an honor that the
Senate give to him.

19
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,620
And with that is a shift.

20
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,870
He's saying, well, this is
a change from the past now.

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,570
He can't do the same kind of
promoting himself in the ways

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,500
he had before-- in
battle struggling

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,770
against the other people
that wanted to rule.

24
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,600
So here he's saying,
well, I'm ruling now,

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,570
and I'm changing the propaganda.

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,250
SPEAKER 2: Going back to looking
at this statue in front of us,

27
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,080
it's not necessarily the
kind of empire builder

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,150
that we would imagine.

29
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,330
This is quite stripped down.

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,380
I'm mean, he's a young man.

31
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,360
He's got a kind of
contemplative look.

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,750
He never seems to be meeting
your eye no matter where

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,270
you stand.

34
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,300
SPEAKER 1: I've walked
around him a few times now.

35
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,210
He won't look me in the eye.

36
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,140
SPEAKER 2: But he has
these very piercing eyes,

37
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,700
which are actually
made out of glass.

38
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,490
So they really stand out from
the dark bronze that we see.

39
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,990
SPEAKER 1: That's
something that you

40
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,300
see on other antique
sculptures as well.

41
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,110
SPEAKER 2: This is really well
preserved with a lot of detail

42
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,284
for something that's so old.

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,950
SPEAKER 1: And The
fact that it's bronze

44
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:31,926
is extremely unusual.

45
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,719
Because, of course,
not many bronze figures

46
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,640
would have lasted from
antiquity, because people

47
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,010
would usually melt
the metal down

48
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,734
and use it for another purpose.

49
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,480
SPEAKER 2: And there's
this fabulous story

50
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,590
about why this particular
head is so well preserved,

51
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,960
which is that it was
actually part of statue that

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,380
was put up in Egypt.

53
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,240
And at one point
the Kush Empire,

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,820
these enemies of the Romans
who were in charge of Egypt

55
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,050
at the time, invaded.

56
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,257
They knocked down the statue.

57
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:58,705
They took it away, and
it was like, ah-hah.

58
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:00,775
Thumb your nose at
the Roman Empire

59
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,370
by burying the head
of the emperor.

60
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,480
SPEAKER 1: And cutting
the head off a statue

61
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,980
is symbolic for
cutting the power--

62
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,310
the source of power of
the emperor himself.

63
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:11,099
And what they did with
it was very unusual.

64
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,750
They buried it underneath the
temple where they worshiped.

65
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:15,666
So they were actually
all standing on his head

66
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:18,312
and treading on him whenever
they went to worship.

67
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,599
So that's a good way of
trampling him under their feet,

68
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,580
always reminding him,
you're beneath us.

69
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,080
SPEAKER 2: The thing
that strikes me

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,980
about this is he's
portraying himself

71
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,900
in a very specific
way, obviously.

72
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,180
And there's this connection
to Alexander the Great

73
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,410
through the youth and the
tousled hair and, of course,

74
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,360
Alexander the Great
being the ultimate role

75
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,430
model for the young
military genius.

76
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,350
And this is clearly a
tradition that Augustus

77
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,920
is tapping into here.

78
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,080
But he's also giving himself
quite a bit of dignity

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,470
with this portrayal, He's got
the slightly furrowed brow,

80
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,410
but just enough to imply
a focus, not a worry.

81
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:53,834
SPEAKER 1: And
that's interesting,

82
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,850
because at this time when
he's creating this new image

83
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,730
he was trying to create
a shift in society.

84
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,850
He didn't want it to be warring,
infighting senators trying to

85
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:03,345
up themselves and promote
their own prowess.

86
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,520
He was bringing it
back to moral outlook,

87
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,490
down to the individual.

88
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,950
And he took the
name of Principate,

89
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:09,628
so he's the first
amongst equals.

90
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,520
And he tried to lead by example,
talking about family values.

91
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,450
And the imagery he took on,
he was promoting that as well.

92
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,330
And it's interesting to
talk about his youth,

93
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,860
because he used this
image until he died.

94
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,165
So he died at l think '76
or something like that.

95
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,200
And he never got another
[INAUDIBLE] or anything.

96
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,771
SPEAKER 2: So the idea of the
state portrait in Britain--

97
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,150
there's images of
Queen Elizabeth

98
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,105
and they're everywhere.

99
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:31,024
SPEAKER 1: We age her.

100
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,729
On our coins we have aged her
like every 20, 40 years or so,

101
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,620
we put a couple of wrinkles on
her and make her a bit fatter.

102
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,000
SPEAKER 2: Not so
much with Augustus?

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,100
SPEAKER 1: No, and
then every emperor

104
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,490
afterwards took that approach.

105
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,779
So they could maybe depict
themselves as an old person,

106
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,490
but they would never age
themselves any further

107
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,780
than their original image.

108
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,360
SPEAKER 2: It's also
worth remembering

109
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:47,843
that what had come
before this was

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,210
the Roman Republic-- the Senate.

111
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,590
And the idea was that
Roman citizens had a say

112
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,730
and voted on things.

113
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,150
And this is Augustus who's
breaking from that mold

114
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,420
and making it an empire.

115
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,050
So he's the first among
equals trying to connect back

116
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,770
to that republic idea, but
also putting himself slightly

117
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,390
over it.

118
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,500
And this is slightly
bigger than life size,

119
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,790
so he would have been a little
bit bigger than anybody.

120
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,292
SPEAKER 1: Anybody
else, definitely.

121
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,281
But he was everywhere.

122
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,930
This image would
have been everywhere.

123
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,290
And it was in towns
as far off, flung

124
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,560
afield as Egypt,
the furthest corner

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,780
of the empire at that time.

126
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,146
And it's that the
statue actually

127
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,970
stood in for the
emperor himself.

128
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,780
So he would be able to
preside over court hearings

129
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,170
and pass judgments in his
presence in the statue.

130
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,060
SPEAKER 2: So the idea
of imbuing a statue

131
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,170
with a bit of the
personality of the person

132
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,625
that it is portraying--

133
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,755
SPEAKER 1: The power that
dwells inside the statue.

134
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,540
SPEAKER 2: And, of course, we
don't know what he looks like.

135
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,060
But this is a quite
realistic seeming portrayal.

136
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,176
A man could look like that.

137
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,820
He's quite attractive.

138
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:45,845
SPEAKER 1: He's
very sympathetic.

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,850
SPEAKER 2: He looks
like someone who

140
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,185
would give you a fair trial.

141
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:49,725
SPEAKER 1: And the
fact that the head

142
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:51,266
has been removed
from the statute

143
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,230
by the Kush-- they are
attacking that power.

144
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,480
They're attacking the statute.

145
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,020
And remember, that
statute is Augustus

146
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,190
in all intents and purposes.

147
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:58,496
And they managed to behead him.

148
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,230
So unfortunate for him, they had
his head cut off in the statue,

149
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:02,692
but lucky for us,
because it's been

150
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,660
preserved in the sands of Egypt.

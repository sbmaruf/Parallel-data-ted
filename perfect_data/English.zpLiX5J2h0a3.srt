1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,670
Use completing the square
to find the roots of the

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,870
quadratic equation right here.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,830
And when anyone talks about
roots, this just means find

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,270
the x's where y is equal to 0.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,940
That's what a root is.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,270
A root is an x value that will
make this quadratic function

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,650
equal 0, that will
make y equal 0.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,205
So to find the x's, let's
just make y equal 0 and

9
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:31,150
then solve for x.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:39,310
So we get 0 is equal to 4x
squared plus 40x, plus 280.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,240
Now, the first step that we
might want to do, just because

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,430
it looks like all three of these
terms are divisible by

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,810
4, is just divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,970
That'll make our math a
little bit simpler.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,800
So let's just divide everything
by 4 here.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,300
If we just divide everything by
4, we get 0 is equal to x

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:12,160
squared plus 10x, plus-- 280
divided by 4 is 70-- plus 70.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,320
Now, they say use completing the
square, and actually, let

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,700
me write that 70 a little bit
further out, and you'll see

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,820
why I did that in a second.

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,110
So let me just write a plus 70
over here, just to have kind

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,280
of an awkward space here.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,690
And you'll see what I'm about
to do with this space, that

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,160
has everything to do with
completing the square.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,330
So they say use completing the
square, which means, turn

26
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,410
this, if you can, into
a perfect square.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,470
Turn at least part of this
expression into a perfect

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,650
square, and then we can use that
to actually solve for x.

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,960
So how do we turn this into
a perfect square?

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,280
Well, we have a 10x here.

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,440
And we know that we can turn
this into a perfect square

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,050
trinomial if we take 1/2 of the
10, which is 5, and then

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,300
we square that.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,880
So 1/2 of 10 is 5, you square
it, you add a 25.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,130
Now, you can't just willy-nilly
add a 25 to one

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,540
side of the equation without
doing something to the other,

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,780
or without just subtracting
the 25 right here.

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,160
Right?

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
Think about it, I have not
changed the equation.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
I've added 25 and I've
subtracted 25.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,889
So I've added nothing to
the right-hand side.

42
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,260
I could add a billion and
subtract a billion and not

43
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,160
change the equation.

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,610
So I have not changed the
equation at all right here.

45
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,880
But what I have done is I've
made it possible to express

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,130
these three terms as
a perfect square.

47
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,460
That right there,
2 times 5 is 10.

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,830
5 squared is 25.

49
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,580
So that is x plus 5 squared.

50
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,880
And if you don't believe
me, multiply it out.

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,250
You're going to have an x
squared plus 5x, plus 5x,

52
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,650
which will give you 10x, plus
5 squared, which is 25.

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,290
So those first three terms
become that, and then the

54
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,670
second two terms, right there,
you just add them.

55
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,870
Let's see, negative
25 plus 70.

56
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,560
Let's see, negative 20 plus 70
would be positive 50, and then

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,680
you have another 5,
so it's plus 45.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,730
So we've just algebraically
manipulated this equation.

59
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,460
And we get 0 is equal to x
plus 5 squared, plus 45.

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,810
Now, we could've, from the
beginning if we wanted, we

61
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,920
could've tried to factor it.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,970
But what we're going to do here,
this will always work.

63
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,360
Even if you have crazy decimal
numbers here, you can solve

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,810
for x using the method
we're doing here,

65
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,420
completing the square.

66
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,590
So to solve for x, let's just
subtract 45 from both sides of

67
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,840
this equation.

68
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,330
And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes negative

69
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,730
45, negative 45, and the right-hand
side will be just

70
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,260
the x plus 5 squared.

71
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,570
These guys, right here,
cancel out.

72
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,250
Now, normally if I look at
something like this I'll say,

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,280
OK, let's just take the
square root of both

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,670
sides of this equation.

75
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,000
And so you might be tempted to
take the square root of both

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,500
sides of this equation, but
immediately when you do that,

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,950
you'll notice something
strange.

78
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,800
We're trying to take
the square root

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,760
of a negative number.

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,180
And if we're dealing with real
numbers, which is everything

81
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,890
we've dealt with so far, you
can't take a square root of a

82
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,460
negative number.

83
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,380
There is no real number that if
you square it will give you

84
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,040
a negative number.

85
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,740
So it's not possible-- I don't
care what you make x-- it is

86
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,690
not possible to add x to
5 and square it, and

87
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,820
get a negative number.

88
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:33,680
So there is no x that can
satisfy-- if we assume that is

89
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,450
x is a real number-- that can
satisfy this equation.

90
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,200
Because I don't care what x you
put here, what real x you

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,920
put here, you add 5 to it, you
square it, there's no way

92
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,210
you're going to get
a negative number.

93
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,000
So there's no x that can satisfy
this equation, so we

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,260
could say there are no-- and
I'm using the word real

95
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,280
because in Algebra 2 you'll
learn that there are things

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,310
called complex numbers, but
don't worry about that right

97
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:08,236
now-- but there no real roots
to the quadratic equation.

98
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,340
And we're done.

99
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,070
And actually, if you had tried
to factor it, you would have

100
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,950
found it very difficult,
because this is not a

101
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,530
factorable expression right
here, and you know it because

102
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,680
there's no real roots.

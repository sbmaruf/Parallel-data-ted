1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,390
Simplify the rate of cans of
soda compared to people.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,400
So this ratio here says that
we have 92 cans of soda for

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,920
every 28 people.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
What we want to do is simplify
this, and really just putting

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,930
this ratio, or this fraction,
in simplest form.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,670
So the best way to do that is
just to figure out what is the

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,440
largest number, or the largest
common factor, of both 92 and

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,480
28, and divide both of these
numbers by that common factor.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,800
So let's figure out
what it is.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,320
And to do that, let's just take
the prime factorization

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,300
of 92, and then we'll do the
prime factorization of 28.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:46,820
So 92 is 2 times 46, which
is 2 times 23.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,360
And 23 is a prime number,
so we're done.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,940
92 is 2 times 2 times 23.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,400
And if we did the prime
factorization of 28, 28 is 2

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:06,100
times 14, which is 2 times 7.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:14,150
So we can rewrite the 92 cans of
soda as 2 times 2 times 23

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:31,530
cans of soda for every 2
times 2 times 7 people.

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,920
Now, both of these numbers have
a 2 times 2 in it, or

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,060
they're both divisible by 4.

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,770
That is their greatest
common factor.

22
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,210
So let's divide both the
top number and the

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,060
bottom number by 4.

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,625
So if you divide the top number
by 4, or if you divide

25
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,960
it by 2 times 2, it will cancel
out right over there.

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,410
And then if you do the bottom
number divided by 4, or 2

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,330
times 2, it will cancel out
with that 2 times 2.

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,080
And we are left with 23 cans of
soda for every 7 people, or

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,740
7 people for every
23 cans of soda.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,320
And we're done!

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,540
We've simplified the rate of
cans, or the ratio of cans, of

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,260
soda compared to people.

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,770
I guess they're considering this
a rate, so maybe they're

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,490
saying how quickly do 7 people
consume cans over some period,

35
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,700
or you can view it as a ratio.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,020
What is the least common
multiple, abbreviated as LCM,

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,850
of 15, 6, and 10?

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,949
So the least common
multiple is exactly what

5
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:10,740
the word is saying.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,054
It's the least common
multiple of these numbers.

7
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:15,970
And I know that probably
didn't help you much.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,620
But let's actually work
through this problem.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,161
So to do that, let's just think
about the different multiples

10
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,880
of the 15, 6, and 10 and
then find at the smallest

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,160
multiple, the least multiple,
they have in common.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,170
So let's find the
multiples of 15.

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,580
So you have 1 times 15 is 15.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,280
2 times 15 is 30.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,740
Then if you add 15
again, you get 45.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,880
You add 15 again, you get 60.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,100
You add 15 again, you get 75.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,370
You add 15 again, you get 90.

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,560
You add 15 again, you get 105.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,745
And if still none of
these are common multiples

21
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,245
with these guys over here, then
we might have to go further.

22
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:56,640
But I'll stop there for now.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,310
So that's the multiples
of 15 up through 105.

24
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,060
Obviously, we can
keep going from there.

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,335
Now, let's do the
multiples of 6.

26
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:10,450

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,160
1 times 6 is 6.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,700
2 times 6 is 12.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
3 times 6 is 18.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,250
4 times 6 is 24.

31
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,486
5 times 6 is 30.

32
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:23,640
6 times 6 is 36.

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,680
7 times 6 is 42.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,120
8 times 6 is 48.

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,030
9 times 6 is 54.

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,490
10 times 6 is 60.

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,800
60 already looks
interesting, because it

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,985
is a common multiple
of both 15 and 60,

39
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:39,610
although we have two
of them over here.

40
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,150
We have a 30, and we have a 30.

41
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,170
We have a 60 and a 60.

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,760
So the smallest common
multiple, so if we only

43
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,710
cared about the least
common multiple of 15 and 6,

44
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,320
we would say it's 30.

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,440
So let me write this
down as an intermediate.

46
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,700
The LCM of 15 and 6, so
the least common multiple,

47
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,870
the smallest multiple
that they have in common,

48
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,710
we see over here.

49
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,090
15 times 2 is 30.

50
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,140
And 6 times 5 is 30.

51
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,960
So this is definitely
a common multiple.

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,251
And it's the smallest of all
of their common multiples.

53
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:11,624
60 is also a common multiple.

54
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:12,540
But it's a bigger one.

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,160
This is the least
common multiple.

56
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,660
So this is 30.

57
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,600
Well, we haven't thought
about the 10 yet.

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,010
So let's bring the 10 in there.

59
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,660
And I think you already
see where this is going.

60
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,470
Let's do the multiples of 10.

61
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,730
They are 10, 20, 30, 40.

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,350
Well, we already
went far enough,

63
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,130
because we already got to 30.

64
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,040
And 30 is a common
multiple of 15 and 6.

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,250
And it's the smallest common
multiple of all of them.

66
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,270
So it's actually the fact
that the LCM of 15, 6, and 10

67
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,789
is equal to 30.

68
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:50,080
Now, this is one way to find
the least common multiple.

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Literally just look at the
multiples of each of the number

70
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,510
and then see what the
smallest multiple they have

71
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,350
is in common.

72
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,820
Another way to do
that is to look

73
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,670
at the prime factorization
of each of these numbers.

74
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,450
And the least common
multiple is the number

75
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,550
that has all of the elements
of the prime factorizations

76
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,140
of these and nothing else.

77
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,450
So let me show you
what I mean by that.

78
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,960
So you could do it this way.

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,440
Or you could say 15 is the
same thing as 3 times 5.

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,149
And that's it.

81
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,440
That's its prime factorization.

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,790
15 is 3 times 5.

83
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,800
Both 3 and 5 are prime.

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,346
We can say that 6 is the
same thing as 2 times 3.

85
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:27,846
That's it.

86
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,440
That's its prime factorization.

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,830
Both 2 and 3 are prime.

88
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,610
And then we can say that 10 is
the same thing as 2 times 5.

89
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,220
Both 2 and 5 are prime.

90
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,210
So we're done factoring it.

91
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:49,510
And so the least common
multiple of 15, 6, and 10 just

92
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,410
needs to have all of
these prime factors.

93
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,880
And what I mean, to be clear, is
in order to be divisible by 15,

94
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,180
it has to have at
least one 3 and one 5

95
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,760
in its prime factorization.

96
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,970
So it has to have at least
one 3 and at least one 5.

97
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,520
By having a 3 times 5 in
its prime factorization,

98
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,780
that ensures that this
number is divisible by 15.

99
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,890
To be divisible by 6, it has to
have at least one 2 and one 3.

100
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,870
So it has to have
at least one 2.

101
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,500
And we already
have a 3 over here.

102
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,529
So that's all we want.

103
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,709
We just need one 3.

104
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,310
So one 2 and one
3, this 2 times 3,

105
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,319
ensures that we
are divisible by 6.

106
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,360
And let me make it clear.

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,760
This right here is the 15.

108
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,090
And then to make sure that
we're divisible by 10,

109
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,550
we have to have at
least one 2 and one 5.

110
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,820

111
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,600
These two over here make sure
that we are divisible by 10.

112
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,190
And so we have all of them.

113
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,990
This 2 times 3 times 5 has
all of the prime factors

114
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,990
of either 10, 6, or 15.

115
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,060
So it is the least
common multiple.

116
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,430
And so if you multiply this out,
you will get 2 times 3 is 6.

117
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,370
6 times 5 is 30.

118
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,740
So either way, hopefully, both
of these resonate with you.

119
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,680
And you see why they make sense.

120
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,960
This second way is
a little bit better

121
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,920
if you're trying to do it for
really complex numbers, numbers

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,940
where you might have to be
multiplying it for a long time.

123
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,140
Either way, both of
these are valid ways

124
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,604
of finding the least
common multiple.

125
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,104

1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,290
Where, is the European Union? Obviously here
somewhere, but much like the the European

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,630
continent itself, which has an unclear boundary,
the European Union also has some fuzzy edges

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,130
to it.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,080
To start, the official members of the European
Union are, in decreasing order of population:

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,590
* Germany
* France

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,689
* The United Kingdom
* Italy

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,600
* Spain
* Poland

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,059
* Romania
* The Kingdom of the Netherlands

9
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:17,839
* Greece
* Belgium

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,980
* Portugal
* The Czech Republic

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,720
* Hungary
* Sweden

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,620
* Austria
* Bulgaria

13
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,509
* Denmark
* Slovakia

14
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:22,269
* Finland
* Ireland

15
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,100
* Croatia
* Lithuania

16
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:23,849
* Latvia
* Slovenia

17
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:24,539
* Estonia
* Cyprus

18
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,969
* Luxembourg
* Malta

19
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,880
The edges of the EU will probably continue
to expand further out as there are other countries

20
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,590
in various stages of trying to become a member.

21
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,410
How exactly the European Union works is hideously
complicated and a story for another time,

22
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,210
but for this video you need know only three
things:

23
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,300
1. Countries pay membership dues and

24
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,490
2. Vote on laws they all must follow and

25
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,920
3. Citizens of member countries are automatically
European Union citizens as well

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,720
This last means that if you're a citizen of
any of these countries you are free to live

27
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,830
and work or retire in any of the others. Which
is nice especially if you think your country

28
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,129
is too big or too small or too hot or too
cold. The European Union gives you options.

29
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,620
By the way, did you notice how all three of
these statements have asterisks attached to

30
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,240
this unhelpful footnote? Well, get used to
it: Europe loves asterisks that add exceptions

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,020
to complicated agreements.

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,630
These three, for example, point us toward
the first bit of border fuzziness with Norway,

33
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,580
Iceland and little Liechtenstein. None of
which are in the European Union but if you're

34
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,949
a EU citizen you can live in these countries
and Norwegians, Icelanders, or Liechtensteiner(in)s

35
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,950
can can live in yours.

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,710
Why? In exchange for the freedom of movement
of people they have to pay membership fees

37
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,310
to the European Union -- even though they
aren't a part of it and thus don't get a say

38
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,480
its laws that they still have to follow.

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,349
This arrangement is the European Economic
Area and it sounds like a terrible deal, were

40
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,170
it not for that asterisk which grants EEA
but not EU members a pass on some areas of

41
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,660
law notably farming and fishing -- something
a country like Iceland might care quite a

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,519
lot about running their own way.

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,260
Between the European Union and the European
Economic Area the continent looks mostly covered,

44
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,529
with the notable exception of Switzerland
who remains neutral and fiercely independent,

45
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,689
except for her participation in the Schengen
Area.

46
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,249
If you're from a country that keeps her borders
extremely clean and / or well-patrolled, the

47
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,919
Schengen Area is a bit mind-blowing because
it's an agreement between countries to take

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,850
a 'meh' approach to borders.

49
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,939
In the Schengen Area international boundaries
look like this: no border officers or passport

50
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,450
checks of any kind. You can walk from Lisbon
to Tallinn without identification or need

51
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,440
to answer the question: "business or pleasure?".

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,490
For Switzerland being part of Schengen but
not part of the European Union means that

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,710
non-swiss can check in any time they like,
but they can never stay.

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,620
This koombaya approach to borders isn't appreciated
by everyone in the EU: most loudly, the United

55
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,720
Kingdom and Ireland who argue that islands
are different. Thus to get onto these fair

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,420
isles, you'll need a passport and a good reason.

57
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,940
Britannia's reluctance to get fully involved
with the EU brings us to the next topic: money.

58
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,040
The European Union has its own fancy currency,
the Euro used by the majority, but not all

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,210
of the European Union members. This economic
union is called the Eurozone and to join a

60
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,410
country must first reach certain financial
goals -- and lying about reaching those goals

61
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,540
is certainly not something anyone would do.

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,650
Most of the non-Eurozone members when they
meet the goals, will ditch their local currency

63
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,890
in favor of the Euro but three of them Denmark,
Sweden and, of course, the United Kingdom,

64
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,820
have asterisks attracted to the Euro sections
of the treaty giving them a permanent out-out.

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,160
And weirdly, four tiny European countries
Andorra, San Marino, Monaco &amp; Vatican City

66
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,270
have an asterisk giving them the reverse:
the right print and use Euros as their money,

67
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,530
despite not being in the European Union at
all.

68
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,210
So that's the big picture: there's the EU,
which makes all the rules, the Eurozone inside

69
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,440
it with a common currency, the European Economic
Area outside of it where people can move freely

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,560
and the selective Schengen, for countries
who think borders just aren't worth the hassle.

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,790
As you can see, there's some strange overlaps
with these borders, but we're not done talking

72
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,490
about complications by a long shot one again,
because empire.

73
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,910
So Portugal and Spain have islands from their
colonial days that they've never parted with:

74
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,200
these are the Madeira and Canary Islands are
off the coast of Africa and the Azores well

75
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,180
into the Atlantic. Because these islands are
Spanish and Portuguese they're part of the

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,760
European Union as well.

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,530
Adding a few islands to the EU's borders isn't
a big deal until you consider France: the

78
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,110
queen of not-letting go. She still holds onto
a bunch of islands in the Caribbean, Reunion

79
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,760
off the coast of Madagascar and French Guiana
in South America. As far as France is concerned,

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,530
these are France too, which single handedly
extends the edge-to-edge distance of the European

81
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,400
Union across a third of Earth's circumference.

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,430
Collectively, these bits of France, Spain
and Portugal are called the Outermost Regions

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,940
-- and they're the result of the simple answer
to empire: just keep it.

84
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,010
On the other hand, there's the United Kingdom,
the master of maintaining complicated relationships

85
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,490
with her quasi-former lands -- and she's by
no means alone in this on such an empire-happy

86
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,120
continent.

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,570
The Netherlands and Denmark and France (again)
all have what the European Union calls Overseas

88
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,240
Territories: they're not part of the European
Union, instead they're a bottomless well of

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,310
asterisks due to their complicated relationships
with both with the European Union and their

90
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,720
associated countries which makes it hard to
say anything meaningful about them as a group

91
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,490
but...

92
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,900
in general European Union law doesn't apply
to these places, though in general the people

93
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,100
who live there are European Union citizens
because in general they have the citizenship

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,190
of their associated country, so in general
they can live anywhere in the EU they want

95
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,060
but in general other European Union citizens
can't freely move to these territories.

96
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,440
Which makes these places a weird, semipermeable
membrane of the European Union proper and

97
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,410
the final part we're going to talk about in
detail even though there are still many, more

98
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,960
one-off asterisks you might stumble upon,
such as: the Isle of Man or those Spanish

99
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,940
Cities in North Africa or Gibraltar, who pretends
to be part of Southwest England sometimes,

100
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,340
or that region in Greece where it's totally
legal to ban women, or Saba &amp; friends who

101
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,210
are part of the Netherlands and so should
be part of the EU, but aren't, or the Faeroe

102
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,510
Islands upon which while citizens of Denmark
live they lose their EU citizenship, and on

103
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,860
and on it goes.

104
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,860
These asterisks almost never end, but this
video must.

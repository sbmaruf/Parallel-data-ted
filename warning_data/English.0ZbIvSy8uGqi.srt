1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:03,916
In the last video we did a couple of lattice multiplication problems

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:05,409
and we saw it was pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:07,385
You got to do all your multiplication first

4
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:09,080
and then do all of your addition.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,060
Well, let's try to understand why exactly it worked.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,150
It almost seemed like magic.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,530
And to see why it worked I'm going to redo this problem up here

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,802
and then I'll also try to explain what we did in the longer problems.

9
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:22,849
So when we multiplied twenty-seven--

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,200
so you write your two and your seven just like that-- times forty-eight.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,670
I'm just doing exactly what we did in the previous video.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,550
We drew a lattice, gave the two a column and the seven a column.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,470
Just like that.

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,810
We gave the four a row and we gave the eight a row.

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,960
And then we drew our diagonal.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,502
And the key here is the diagonals, as you can imagine,

17
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,780
otherwise we wouldn't be drawing them.

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,120
So you have your diagonals.

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,297
Now the way to think about it

20
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:53,280
is each of these diagonals are a number place.

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,970
So for example, this diagonal right here, that is the ones place.

22
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:04,210
The next diagonal, I'll do it in this light green color.

23
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,350
The next diagonal right here in the light green color,

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,330
that is the tens place.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,578
Now the next diagonal to the left or above that, depending on how you want to view it,

26
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:16,950
I'll do in this little pink color right here.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,709
You could guess, that's going to be the hundreds place.

28
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,514
And then, finally, we have this little diagonal there,

29
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:27,141
and I'll do it in this light blue color.

30
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:32,080
That is the thousands place.

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,303
So whenever we multiply one digit times another digit,

32
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,610
we just make sure we put it in the right bucket

33
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,650
or in the right place.

34
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,780
And you'll see what I mean in a second.

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,790
So we did seven times four.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,150
Well, we know that seven times four is twenty-eight.

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,460
We just simply wrote a two and an eight just like that.

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,630
But what did we really do?

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,460
And I guess the best way to think about it, this seven--

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,330
this is the seven in twenty-seven.

41
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,310
So it's just a regular seven. Right?

42
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,130
But this four, it's the four in forty-eight.

43
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,920
So it's not just a regular four, it's really a forty.

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,050
Forty-eight can be rewritten as forty plus eight.

45
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,520
This four right here actually represents a forty.

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,520
So right here we're not really multiplying seven times four,

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,810
we're actually multiplying seven times forty.

48
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:27,360
And seven times forty isn't just twenty-eight, it's two hundred eighty.

49
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,440
And two hundred eighty, how can we think about that?

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,320
We could say that's two hundreds plus eight tens.

51
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,620
And that's exactly what we wrote right here.

52
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,820
Notice: this column-- I'm sorry, this diagonal right here,

53
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,110
I already told you, it was the tens diagonal.

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,810
And we multiplied seven times forty.

55
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,520
We put the eight right here in the tens diagonal.

56
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,580
So that means eight tens.

57
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,240
Seven times forty is two hundreds.

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,590
We wrote a two in the hundreds diagonal.

59
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,310
And eight tens.

60
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,600
That's what this two eight here is.

61
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,810
We actually wrote two hundred and eighty.

62
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,920
Let's keep going.

63
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,500
When I multiply two times four.

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,295
You might say, oh, two times four, that's eight.

65
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,325
But what am I really doing?

66
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,300
This is the two in twenty-seven.

67
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,520
This is really a twenty and this is really a forty.

68
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:26,120
So twenty times forty is equal to just eight with two zeros.

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,300
Is equal to eight hundred.

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,290
And what did we do?

71
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,630
We multiplied two times four and we said, oh, two times four is eight.

72
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,079
We wrote a zero and an eight just like that.

73
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,072
But notice where we wrote the eight.

74
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:41,387
We wrote the eight in the hundreds diagonal.

75
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,864
Let me make this a different color.

76
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,740
We wrote it in the one hundreds diagonal.

77
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,159
So we literally wrote--

78
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,796
even though it looked like we multiplied two times four and saying it's eight,

79
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,146
the way we accounted for it,

80
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:54,572
we really did twenty times forty is equal to eight hundreds.

81
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,380
Remember, this is the hundreds diagonal,

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,900
this whole thing right there.

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,180
And we can keep going.

84
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,270
When you multiply seven times eight.

85
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,090
Remember, this is really seven-- well, this is the seven in twenty-seven,

86
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,090
so it's just a regular seven.

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,870
This is the eight in forty-eight, so it's just a regular eight.

88
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,850
Seven times eight is fifty-six.

89
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,170
You write a six in the ones place.

90
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,800
Fifty-six is just five tens and one six.

91
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,920
So it's five tens in the tens diagonal and one six. Fifty-six.

92
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,195
Then when you multiply two times eight,

93
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:28,210
notice, that's not really just two times eight.

94
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,625
I mean we did write it's just sixteen when we did the problem over here,

95
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,630
but we're actually multiplying twenty.

96
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,500
This is a twenty times eight.

97
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,810
Twenty times eight is equal to one hundred sixty.

98
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,942
Or you could say it's one hundred--

99
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:45,820
notice the one in the one hundreds diagonal-- and six tens.

100
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,114
That's what one hundred sixty is.

101
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:51,635
So what we did by doing this lattice multiplication,

102
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:54,991
is we accounted all the digits. The right digits in the right places.

103
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,830
We put the six in the ones place.

104
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,590
We put the six, the five, and the eight in the tens place.

105
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,080
We put the one, the eight, and the two in the hundreds place.

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,930
And we put nothing right now in the thousands place.

107
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,087
Then, now that we're done with all the multiplication,

108
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,720
we can actually do our adding up.

109
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,196
And then you just keep adding,

110
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:13,445
and if there's something that goes over to the next place,

111
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,699
you just carry that number.

112
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,230
So six in the ones place, well, that's just a six.

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,610
Then you go the tens place.

114
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,640
Eight plus five plus six is what?

115
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,150
Eight plus five is thirteen.

116
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,570
Plus six is nineteen.

117
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,050
But notice, we're in the tens place.

118
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,620
It's nineteen tens or we could say it's nine tens and one hundred.

119
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,902
We carry the one up here, if you can see it, into the hundreds place.

120
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,500
Now we add up all the hundreds.

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,850
One hundred plus two hundred plus eight hundred plus one hundred.

122
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,110
Or, what is this?

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,740
One thousand two hundred.

124
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,180
So you write two in the hundreds place.

125
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,180
One thousand two hundred is the same thing as two hundreds plus one thousand.

126
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,110
And now you only have one thousand in your thousands diagonal.

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,000
And so you write that one right there.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,120
That's exactly how we did it.

129
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,750
The same reasoning applies to the more complex problem.

130
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,010
We can label our places.

131
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,690
This was the ones place right there.

132
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,490
And it made sense.

133
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,224
When we multiplied the nine times the seven,

134
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:17,510
those are just literally nines and sevens. It's sixty-three.

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,770
Six tens and three ones.

136
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,610
This right here is the tens diagonal.

137
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,120
Then we got six tens and three ones.

138
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,085
When we multiplied nine times eighty-- remember, seven hundred eighty-seven,

139
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:36,368
that's the same thing as seven hundreds plus eight tens plus seven, just regular seven ones.

140
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,050
So this nine times eight is really nine times eighty.

141
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,870
Nine times eighty is seven hundred twenty.

142
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,360
Seven hundreds-- this is the hundreds place.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,810
Seven hundreds and twenty-- two tens just right there.

144
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,850
And you can keep going.

145
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,390
This up here, this is the thousands place.

146
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,680
This is the ten thousands.

147
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll write it like that.

148
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,040
This is the hundred thousands place.

149
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,773
And then this was the millions place.

150
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,796
So we did all of our multiplication at once,

151
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:15,172
and accounted for things in their proper place based on what those numbers really are.

152
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:17,339
This entry right here,

153
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,975
it looks like we just multiplied four times eight and got thirty-two,

154
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:27,170
but we actually were multiplying four hundred-- this is a four hundred-- times eighty.

155
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:35,610
And four hundred times eighty is equal to three two and three zeros.

156
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,270
It's equal to thirty-two thousand.

157
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,870
And the way we counted for it-- notice, we put a two right there,

158
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,150
and what diagonal is that?

159
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,820
That is the thousands diagonal.

160
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,500
So we say it's two thousand and three ten thousands.

161
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,500
So three ten thousands and two thousands.

162
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,375
That's thirty-two thousand.

163
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,867
So hopefully that gives you an understanding.

164
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:59,141
I mean it's fun to maybe do some lattice multiplication and get practice.

165
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:01,865
But you know sometimes it looks like this bizarre magical thing.

166
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:03,830
But hopefully from this video you understand that all it is

167
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,246
is just a different way of keeping track of where the ones, tens, and hundreds place are.

168
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,765
With the advantage that it's kind of nice

169
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,310
and compartmentalized, it doesn't take up a lot of space.

170
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,723
And, it allows you to do all your multiplication at once,

171
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:20,750
and then, switch your brain into addition and carrying mode.

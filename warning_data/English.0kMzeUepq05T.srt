1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:04,716
A farmer grows 531 tomatoes

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:08,600
and is able to sell 176 of them

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,352
in three days.

4
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:20,467
Given that his supply of tomatoes decreases by 176,

5
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,385
how many tomatoes does he have remaining

6
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:25,194
at the end of three days?

7
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:30,419
So he starts with 531 tomatoes

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,578
let me give myself a little more space to work with

9
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:36,341
-- he starts with 531 tomatoes

10
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,973
and he is able to sell 176.

11
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,215
He is essentially going to subtract

12
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,508
the 176 that he is selling.

13
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:44,856
If we want to figure out

14
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,370
how many he is left with,

15
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,000
we are going to subtract 176.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,458
Thatâ€˜s how many he sells in three days.

17
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,801
They're asking us:

18
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,867
how many does he have left at the end of three days?

19
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:56,169
We just have to subtract those 176

20
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,887
from the amount he grew.

21
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:00,906
It turned into this straight up subtraction problem.

22
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:02,717
Lets see if we can do it.

23
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,550
If we go straight to the ones place

24
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,711
right over here

25
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,333
and actually let me do it in parallel

26
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,193
because i think that might be interesting over here.

27
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:11,415
I'm going to do it the way

28
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:13,295
you traditionally do it here on the left

29
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:14,548
and then I'm going to show you

30
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:16,133
what's happening here on the right.

31
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,154
So 531 is the same thing

32
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:21,247
as 500 + 30 + 1

33
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,000
and if you subtract 176

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
that is the same thing as subtracting 100

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,625
and subtracting another 70 and subtracting another 6

36
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,264
I wrote it this way

37
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:34,250
because the 5 in 531 is the same thing as 500

38
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,361
The 3 in 531 is in the tens place

39
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,062
so it's really  representing 30

40
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:42,200
the 1 in  531 is in the ones place

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,800
so it represents one

42
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:44,744
and now

43
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:45,863
it'll be a little bit clearer

44
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,008
what we're doing

45
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,348
when we're borrowing or regouping

46
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:51,236
on this problem right over here

47
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,413
and so let's start off with the ones place

48
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:56,578
one is less than 6

49
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,838
be great if we can regoup some of the values

50
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:01,125
from the rest of the places

51
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,228
so we can go to staright to the tens place

52
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:05,375
the tens place we can borrow

53
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,805
or regroup ten from it

54
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:07,687
so if we take ten from here

55
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,219
this becomes 20

56
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,882
we're going to take that 10 and add it to the 1

57
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:14,667
so this will become 11

58
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,278
we just added a 10

59
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,343
we moved over 10 from the tens place

60
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:20,550
to the ones place

61
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,036
if you look at it over here

62
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:25,134
you could say: Look! we're taking 10 from the 30

63
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,538
that becomes a 20

64
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:29,420
and then the 1 becomes an 11

65
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,417
the way when i was first in school

66
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,485
people say you borrow one

67
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,739
from the three

68
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,000
and you kind of just stick the one right over here

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,176
but what you're really doing

70
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,755
is you're taking a 10 from a 30

71
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,638
and making it into a twenty

72
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:43,359
and you're getting a- you're adding the ten to the one

73
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,075
getting 11

74
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,046
but either way you'll end up with 11

75
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,021
in the ones place

76
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,414
and now you can subtract

77
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:52,920
11 - 6 is 5

78
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,867
now we go over to the tens place

79
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,959
in the tens place

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,235
we now have 2-7

81
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:03,680
which is really representing 20-70

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,728
well we - thats 70 is bigger than the 20

83
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,333
so we want to add some more

84
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,127
to the tens place

85
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:10,933
well we can go the hundreds place

86
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,871
to find some more value to regroup

87
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,809
so let's see if we can do that

88
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,052
we have 500 here

89
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:18,637
so what happens when we take a hundred from that

90
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,458
so we're just left with 400 from here

91
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,733
and we take that 100 and we put it in

92
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,359
the tens place

93
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,121
so instead of 20 we now have 120

94
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:31,067
if you look at it on this problem

95
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,805
since we are using the places here

96
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:36,805
we're going to take 100 from the 500

97
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:37,873
and have 400

98
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:40,289
and then we're going to take that 100

99
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,000
that we took and take it to the tens place

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,267
well 100 is 10 tens

101
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:45,333
so we're going to  add 10 to this

102
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,067
so this is going to become a 12

103
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,693
once again, the way-

104
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:51,400
the kind of more mechanical rope way of thinking about it is that

105
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,324
-oh- you took one away from the four

106
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:56,733
and you stick that one in front on the two

107
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:01,729
but you're really taking a 100 from the 500, making it 400

108
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,344
and then adding that 100 to the 20 here

109
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,248
and making it 120

110
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,873
but your writing here is a 12

111
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,034
because it is 12 tens

112
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,567
you're at the tens place

113
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,635
so let me write it down

114
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:12,563
this is the ones place

115
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:14,375
this is tens place

116
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:19,462
and this is the hundreds place

117
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:23,941
so now that our numbers on top in the tens place

118
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:25,952
is bigger than the numbers on the bottom

119
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:27,039
we can subtract

120
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,047
so we get 120-70 that is 50

121
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:33,503
or 12 minus 7 is 5

122
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,180
5 is in the tens place

123
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,944
so it's really representing 50

124
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,867
let me circle it with the same colour

125
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,856
so you recognise that

126
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,205
this 5 is representing 50

127
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:47,151
then finally we're in the hundreds place

128
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,400
so 400 -100 is 300

129
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,270
4-1 is 3

130
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,000
but this 3 represents 300

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,133
this 5 represents 50

132
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,099
this 5 represents 5

133
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,260
so we're done

134
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,839
we get 355

135
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,133
the farmer is left with 355 tomatoes

136
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,576
at the end of 3 days

137
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:08,671
or 300+50+5 tomatoes.

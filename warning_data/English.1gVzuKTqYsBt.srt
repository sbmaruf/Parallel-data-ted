1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820


2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,600
Where I left off, we were just
essentially chugging through

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,110
this fairly hairy derivative--
this definite integral--

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,910
this antiderivative.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,500
It takes my brain a
little while to come

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,150
up with the next term.

7
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,300
So we evaluated at 2 and
now we have to subtract

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,320
this evaluated at 1.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,120
So minus 16 pi minus 4
pi over 3-- oh, sorry.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,650
Plus.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,390
The minus is going to
be on everything.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,910
Oh no, sorry.

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,270
That is a minus.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,290
That's a minus.

15
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,870
Plus 4 pi.

16
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,100
Right?

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,380
Because x is 1.

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,220
Minus pi over 2.

19
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,440
And now we can simplify it.

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,140
Let's see what we can do.

21
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,340
This is really a hairy problem.

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,750


23
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,680
The 16 pi minus 8 pi,
that equals 8 pi.

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,030
And then that's a plus.

25
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,860
The 32 plus 8 pi.

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,480
32 pi plus 8 pi,
that equals 40 pi.

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,110
So let's see, I've simplified
it to 40 pi, and what's minus

28
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,740
8 times 4 is 32 pi over 3.

29
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,830


30
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,030
And then all of that, let's
see if I can simplify this.

31
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,990
Let's see, 16 pi plus
4 pi, that's 20 pi.

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,560


33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,930
And then, let's see.

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,060
Minus 4 pi over 3
minus pi over 2.

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,740
So let's get a common
denominator for this

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,480
part right here.

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,140
So if I put everything over 6--
20 pi over 6 is the same thing

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:45,015
is 120 pi over 6, and then
minus-- 4 pi over 3, if I put

39
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:48,890
it over 6 it becomes
8 pi over 6, right?

40
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,060
And then pi over 2, if I put it
over 6 it becomes 3 pi over 6.

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,000
So minus 3 pi.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
So this whole term that we're
going to have to subtract from

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,330
this term is equal to
120 minus 11, right?

44
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,260
So that's 109 pi over 6.

45
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,080
This equals 1-- is that right?

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,310
Yeah, 109 pi over 6.

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,980
See what happens when you
make up problems on the fly?

48
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,500
You get ugly numbers.

49
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,890
109 pi over 6.

50
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,970
And what does that
top part translate?

51
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,000
So this is what we're
going to subtract.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,955
This is when we evaluated
the antiderivative at 1.

53
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,510
And let's simplify this one.

54
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,310
So that one, if we put 3 common
denominator, that's 120 pi

55
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,190
over 3 minus 32 pi over 3.

56
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,610
120 minus 32, let's
see, we get 90-- 88?

57
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,290
Right.

58
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,680
88 pi over 3.

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,990
So that equals 88 pi over
3, and remember, that's

60
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,320
just the top part.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,640
And then-- this is more of a
review of fractions than

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,820
anything else-- and then if
I want to put it over

63
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,830
6, I just double it.

64
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,590
So I think we're almost done.

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,230
Let me switch colors.

66
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,790
So if you go over a
denominator of 6-- 88

67
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,100
pi over 3-- let's see.

68
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,670
If I double that, I
get 160-- 176, right?

69
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,780
176 pi minus this.

70
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,910
Minus 109 pi.

71
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,210
I'm sure I made a
careless mistake.

72
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,100
These are my least favorite
type of things to do.

73
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,050
Hairy fractions.

74
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,430
So 176 minus 109.

75
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,000
That's the same thing
as 76 minus 9.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,730
And that is 65.

77
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,890
So our final answer
is 65 pi over 6.

78
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,070
Which isn't as hairy
as it seemed when we

79
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,690
started the problem.

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,410
But that's pretty neat.

81
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,790
This is kind of a
strange shape.

82
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,500
It's kind of a wide ring that
has-- the upper part of the

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,160
ring and the inner part of
the ring are hard edges.

84
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,090
But then it's curved
on the outside.

85
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,830
And we were able to figure
out the volume of that.

86
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,900
Especially-- and what was weird
about this, is when it was

87
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,350
rotated around the line
y is equal to minus 2.

88
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,740
Hopefully I didn't confuse you.

89
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,120
These are about as difficult
as these volume of

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,060
revolution problems get.

91
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,530
If you want more,
just let me know.

92
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,200
I will see you in
the next video.

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,400

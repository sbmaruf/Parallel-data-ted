CHAPTER 12Brute Neighbors

2
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:16,033
Sometimes I had a companion in my fishing,who came through the village to my house

3
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:21,439
from the other side of the town, and thecatching of the dinner was as much a social

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,089
exercise as the eating of it.

5
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:29,022
Hermit.I wonder what the world is doing now.

6
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:35,057
I have not heard so much as a locust overthe sweet-fern these three hours.

7
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:41,979
The pigeons are all asleep upon theirroosts--no flutter from them.

8
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:47,093
Was that a farmer's noon horn which soundedfrom beyond the woods just now?

9
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:53,049
The hands are coming in to boiled salt beefand cider and Indian bread.

10
00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:04,209
Why will men worry themselves so?He that does not eat need not work.

11
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,076
I wonder how much they have reaped.

12
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:13,065
Who would live there where a body can neverthink for the barking of Bose?

13
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:22,016
And oh, the housekeeping! to keep brightthe devil's door-knobs, and scour his tubs

14
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,062
this bright day!

15
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:32,007
Better not keep a house.Say, some hollow tree; and then for morning

16
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:38,054
calls and dinner-parties!Only a woodpecker tapping.

17
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:49,061
Oh, they swarm; the sun is too warm there;they are born too far into life for me.

18
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:53,061
I have water from the spring, and a loaf ofbrown bread on the shelf.--Hark!

19
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:58,019
I hear a rustling of the leaves.

20
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:06,004
Is it some ill-fed village hound yieldingto the instinct of the chase? or the lost

21
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:12,529
pig which is said to be in these woods,whose tracks I saw after the rain?

22
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:21,063
It comes on apace; my sumachs andsweetbriers tremble.--Eh, Mr. Poet, is it

23
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:26,082
you?How do you like the world to-day?

24
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,639
Poet.

25
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:35,029
See those clouds; how they hang!That's the greatest thing I have seen to-

26
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,749
day.

27
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:41,749
There's nothing like it in old paintings,nothing like it in foreign lands--unless

28
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:46,049
when we were off the coast of Spain.That's a true Mediterranean sky.

29
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:53,016
I thought, as I have my living to get, andhave not eaten to-day, that I might go a-

30
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:57,099
fishing.That's the true industry for poets.

31
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,093
It is the only trade I have learned.

32
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:06,071
Come, let's along.Hermit.

33
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:11,789
I cannot resist.My brown bread will soon be gone.

34
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:18,389
I will go with you gladly soon, but I amjust concluding a serious meditation.

35
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,449
I think that I am near the end of it.Leave me alone, then, for a while.

36
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:29,249
But that we may not be delayed, you shallbe digging the bait meanwhile.

37
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:33,179
Angleworms are rarely to be met with inthese parts, where the soil was never

38
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:38,589
fattened with manure; the race is nearlyextinct.

39
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:43,002
The sport of digging the bait is nearlyequal to that of catching the fish, when

40
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:49,679
one's appetite is not too keen; and thisyou may have all to yourself today.

41
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:55,199
I would advise you to set in the spade downyonder among the ground-nuts, where you see

42
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,449
the johnswort waving.

43
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:03,389
I think that I may warrant you one worm toevery three sods you turn up, if you look

44
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,038
well in among the roots of the grass, as ifyou were weeding.

45
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:13,449
Or, if you choose to go farther, it willnot be unwise, for I have found the

46
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:20,049
increase of fair bait to be very nearly asthe squares of the distances.

47
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,021
Hermit alone.

48
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:28,005
Let me see; where was I?Methinks I was nearly in this frame of

49
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:38,062
mind; the world lay about at this angle.Shall I go to heaven or a-fishing?

50
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:45,049
If I should soon bring this meditation toan end, would another so sweet occasion be

51
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:51,006
likely to offer?I was as near being resolved into the

52
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:54,065
essence of things as ever I was in my life.

53
00:04:54,065 --> 00:05:01,046
I fear my thoughts will not come back tome.

54
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:06,034
If it would do any good, I would whistlefor them.

55
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:11,042
When they make us an offer, is it wise tosay, We will think of it?

56
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:21,001
My thoughts have left no track, and Icannot find the path again.

57
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,006
What was it that I was thinking of?

58
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:31,083
It was a very hazy day.I will just try these three sentences of

59
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:39,009
Confut-see; they may fetch that state aboutagain.

60
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:45,015
I know not whether it was the dumps or abudding ecstasy.

61
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:49,026
Mem.There never is but one opportunity of a

62
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:51,076
kind.

63
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:57,002
Poet.How now, Hermit, is it too soon?

64
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:02,067
I have got just thirteen whole ones, besideseveral which are imperfect or undersized;

65
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:08,039
but they will do for the smaller fry; theydo not cover up the hook so much.

66
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,096
Those village worms are quite too large; ashiner may make a meal off one without

67
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:17,089
finding the skewer.Hermit.

68
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,064
Well, then, let's be off.

69
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:23,065
Shall we to the Concord?There's good sport there if the water be

70
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:29,058
not too high.Why do precisely these objects which we

71
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:31,008
behold make a world?

72
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:38,086
Why has man just these species of animalsfor his neighbors; as if nothing but a

73
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:43,025
mouse could have filled this crevice?

74
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:50,081
I suspect that Pilpay & Co. have putanimals to their best use, for they are all

75
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:59,012
beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carrysome portion of our thoughts.

76
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:03,046
The mice which haunted my house were notthe common ones, which are said to have

77
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:10,065
been introduced into the country, but awild native kind not found in the village.

78
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:16,002
I sent one to a distinguished naturalist,and it interested him much.

79
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:21,064
When I was building, one of these had itsnest underneath the house, and before I had

80
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:26,068
laid the second floor, and swept out theshavings, would come out regularly at lunch

81
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:30,026
time and pick up the crumbs at my feet.

82
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:35,081
It probably had never seen a man before;and it soon became quite familiar, and

83
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:39,031
would run over my shoes and up my clothes.

84
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:44,051
It could readily ascend the sides of theroom by short impulses, like a squirrel,

85
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:47,063
which it resembled in its motions.

86
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:53,048
At length, as I leaned with my elbow on thebench one day, it ran up my clothes, and

87
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:59,004
along my sleeve, and round and round thepaper which held my dinner, while I kept

88
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:02,018
the latter close, and dodged and played at

89
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:08,026
bopeep with it; and when at last I heldstill a piece of cheese between my thumb

90
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:15,001
and finger, it came and nibbled it, sittingin my hand, and afterward cleaned its face

91
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,089
and paws, like a fly, and walked away.

92
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:28,027
A phoebe soon built in my shed, and a robinfor protection in a pine which grew against

93
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,026
the house.

94
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:38,229
In June the partridge (Tetrao umbellus),which is so shy a bird, led her brood past

95
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,039
my windows, from the woods in the rear tothe front of my house, clucking and calling

96
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:52,799
to them like a hen, and in all her behaviorproving herself the hen of the woods.

97
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,469
The young suddenly disperse on yourapproach, at a signal from the mother, as

98
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:04,069
if a whirlwind had swept them away, andthey so exactly resemble the dried leaves

99
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:08,012
and twigs that many a traveler has placed

100
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:14,299
his foot in the midst of a brood, and heardthe whir of the old bird as she flew off,

101
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:19,026
and her anxious calls and mewing, or seenher trail her wings to attract his

102
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:24,669
attention, without suspecting theirneighborhood.

103
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:30,046
The parent will sometimes roll and spinround before you in such a dishabille, that

104
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:36,038
you cannot, for a few moments, detect whatkind of creature it is.

105
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:43,037
The young squat still and flat, oftenrunning their heads under a leaf, and mind

106
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:48,029
only their mother's directions given from adistance, nor will your approach make them

107
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,429
run again and betray themselves.

108
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:54,075
You may even tread on them, or have youreyes on them for a minute, without

109
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,719
discovering them.

110
00:09:56,719 --> 00:10:02,599
I have held them in my open hand at such atime, and still their only care, obedient

111
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:10,299
to their mother and their instinct, was tosquat there without fear or trembling.

112
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:15,929
So perfect is this instinct, that once,when I had laid them on the leaves again,

113
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:20,083
and one accidentally fell on its side, itwas found with the rest in exactly the same

114
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,539
position ten minutes afterward.

115
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:31,014
They are not callow like the young of mostbirds, but more perfectly developed and

116
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:35,359
precocious even than chickens.

117
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:41,239
The remarkably adult yet innocentexpression of their open and serene eyes is

118
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:46,062
very memorable.All intelligence seems reflected in them.

119
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:55,027
They suggest not merely the purity ofinfancy, but a wisdom clarified by

120
00:10:55,027 --> 00:11:01,719
experience.Such an eye was not born when the bird was,

121
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:07,069
but is coeval with the sky it reflects.

122
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:14,095
The woods do not yield another such a gem.The traveller does not often look into such

123
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:17,909
a limpid well.

124
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:25,012
The ignorant or reckless sportsman oftenshoots the parent at such a time, and

125
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:33,669
leaves these innocents to fall a prey tosome prowling beast or bird, or gradually

126
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:39,719
mingle with the decaying leaves which theyso much resemble.

127
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:44,929
It is said that when hatched by a hen theywill directly disperse on some alarm, and

128
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:52,659
so are lost, for they never hear themother's call which gathers them again.

129
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:57,033
These were my hens and chickens.

130
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:02,929
It is remarkable how many creatures livewild and free though secret in the woods,

131
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:07,859
and still sustain themselves in theneighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters

132
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:10,269
only.

133
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:18,088
How retired the otter manages to live here!He grows to be four feet long, as big as a

134
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:23,239
small boy, perhaps without any human beinggetting a glimpse of him.

135
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:31,359
I formerly saw the raccoon in the woodsbehind where my house is built, and

136
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,929
probably still heard their whinnering atnight.

137
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:41,669
Commonly I rested an hour or two in theshade at noon, after planting, and ate my

138
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:46,779
lunch, and read a little by a spring whichwas the source of a swamp and of a brook,

139
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:55,064
oozing from under Brister's Hill, half amile from my field.

140
00:12:55,064 --> 00:13:03,039
The approach to this was through asuccession of descending grassy hollows,

141
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,179
full of young pitch pines, into a largerwood about the swamp.

142
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:16,929
There, in a very secluded and shaded spot,under a spreading white pine, there was yet

143
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,069
a clean, firm sward to sit on.

144
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:29,549
I had dug out the spring and made a well ofclear gray water, where I could dip up a

145
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:35,088
pailful without roiling it, and thither Iwent for this purpose almost every day in

146
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:38,599
midsummer, when the pond was warmest.

147
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:48,001
Thither, too, the woodcock led her brood,to probe the mud for worms, flying but a

148
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:55,239
foot above them down the bank, while theyran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying

149
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,087
me, she would leave her young and circle

150
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:04,399
round and round me, nearer and nearer tillwithin four or five feet, pretending broken

151
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,095
wings and legs, to attract my attention,and get off her young, who would already

152
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:14,056
have taken up their march, with faint, wiry

153
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:20,929
peep, single file through the swamp, as shedirected.

154
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,959
Or I heard the peep of the young when Icould not see the parent bird.

155
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,669
There too the turtle doves sat over thespring, or fluttered from bough to bough of

156
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:39,006
the soft white pines over my head; or thered squirrel, coursing down the nearest

157
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:43,979
bough, was particularly familiar andinquisitive.

158
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:49,000
You only need sit still long enough in someattractive spot in the woods that all its

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,899
inhabitants may exhibit themselves to youby turns.

160
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,082
I was witness to events of a less peacefulcharacter.

161
00:14:57,082 --> 00:15:04,219
One day when I went out to my wood-pile, orrather my pile of stumps, I observed two

162
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:11,025
large ants, the one red, the other muchlarger, nearly half an inch long, and

163
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:16,064
black, fiercely contending with oneanother.

164
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:22,081
Having once got hold they never let go, butstruggled and wrestled and rolled on the

165
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:25,062
chips incessantly.

166
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:28,989
Looking farther, I was surprised to findthat the chips were covered with such

167
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:39,589
combatants, that it was not a duellum, buta bellum, a war between two races of ants,

168
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:49,000
the red always pitted against the black,and frequently two red ones to one black.

169
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,089
The legions of these Myrmidons covered allthe hills and vales in my wood-yard, and

170
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:02,539
the ground was already strewn with the deadand dying, both red and black.

171
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:09,279
It was the only battle which I have everwitnessed, the only battle-field I ever

172
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:20,349
trod while the battle was raging;internecine war; the red republicans on the

173
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:25,599
one hand, and the black imperialists on theother.

174
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,329
On every side they were engaged in deadlycombat, yet without any noise that I could

175
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:37,429
hear, and human soldiers never fought soresolutely.

176
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:43,829
I watched a couple that were fast locked ineach other's embraces, in a little sunny

177
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:50,599
valley amid the chips, now at noondayprepared to fight till the sun went down,

178
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:54,000
or life went out.

179
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,219
The smaller red champion had fastenedhimself like a vice to his adversary's

180
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:05,609
front, and through all the tumblings onthat field never for an instant ceased to

181
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:09,489
gnaw at one of his feelers near the root,

182
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:14,005
having already caused the other to go bythe board; while the stronger black one

183
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:21,169
dashed him from side to side, and, as I sawon looking nearer, had already divested him

184
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,089
of several of his members.

185
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:30,000
They fought with more pertinacity thanbulldogs.

186
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,179
Neither manifested the least disposition toretreat.

187
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:41,009
It was evident that their battle-cry was"Conquer or die."

188
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:47,179
In the meanwhile there came along a singlered ant on the hillside of this valley,

189
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:52,037
evidently full of excitement, who eitherhad despatched his foe, or had not yet

190
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,039
taken part in the battle; probably the

191
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,329
latter, for he had lost none of his limbs;whose mother had charged him to return with

192
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:05,072
his shield or upon it.

193
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:11,061
Or perchance he was some Achilles, who hadnourished his wrath apart, and had now come

194
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:16,959
to avenge or rescue his Patroclus.

195
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,009
He saw this unequal combat from afar--forthe blacks were nearly twice the size of

196
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:31,049
the red--he drew near with rapid pace tillhe stood on his guard within half an inch

197
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,053
of the combatants; then, watching his

198
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:40,169
opportunity, he sprang upon the blackwarrior, and commenced his operations near

199
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:48,047
the root of his right fore leg, leaving thefoe to select among his own members; and so

200
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:51,079
there were three united for life, as if a

201
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:57,709
new kind of attraction had been inventedwhich put all other locks and cements to

202
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,091
shame.

203
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:05,299
I should not have wondered by this time tofind that they had their respective musical

204
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:11,098
bands stationed on some eminent chip, andplaying their national airs the while, to

205
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:17,579
excite the slow and cheer the dyingcombatants.

206
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:24,013
I was myself excited somewhat even as ifthey had been men.

207
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:31,011
The more you think of it, the less thedifference.

208
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:36,025
And certainly there is not the fightrecorded in Concord history, at least, if

209
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:42,179
in the history of America, that will bear amoment's comparison with this, whether for

210
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:48,959
the numbers engaged in it, or for thepatriotism and heroism displayed.

211
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:54,075
For numbers and for carnage it was anAusterlitz or Dresden.

212
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:57,074
Concord Fight!

213
00:19:57,074 --> 00:20:02,035
Two killed on the patriots' side, andLuther Blanchard wounded!

214
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:13,549
Why here every ant was a Buttrick--"Fire!for God's sake fire!"--and thousands shared

215
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:18,009
the fate of Davis and Hosmer.

216
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,073
There was not one hireling there.

217
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:26,041
I have no doubt that it was a principlethey fought for, as much as our ancestors,

218
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:33,000
and not to avoid a three-penny tax on theirtea; and the results of this battle will be

219
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,829
as important and memorable to those whom it

220
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:40,091
concerns as those of the battle of BunkerHill, at least.

221
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:47,049
I took up the chip on which the three Ihave particularly described were

222
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,085
struggling, carried it into my house, andplaced it under a tumbler on my window-

223
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:55,449
sill, in order to see the issue.

224
00:20:55,449 --> 00:21:00,041
Holding a microscope to the first-mentionedred ant, I saw that, though he was

225
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:06,001
assiduously gnawing at the near fore leg ofhis enemy, having severed his remaining

226
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:09,929
feeler, his own breast was all torn away,

227
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,086
exposing what vitals he had there to thejaws of the black warrior, whose

228
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:21,001
breastplate was apparently too thick forhim to pierce; and the dark carbuncles of

229
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:28,062
the sufferer's eyes shone with ferocitysuch as war only could excite.

230
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:34,049
They struggled half an hour longer underthe tumbler, and when I looked again the

231
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:39,539
black soldier had severed the heads of hisfoes from their bodies, and the still

232
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,003
living heads were hanging on either side of

233
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:49,063
him like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as

234
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:55,064
ever, and he was endeavoring with feeblestruggles, being without feelers and with

235
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,038
only the remnant of a leg, and I know not

236
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:05,053
how many other wounds, to divest himself ofthem; which at length, after half an hour

237
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:12,023
more, he accomplished.I raised the glass, and he went off over

238
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:15,084
the window-sill in that crippled state.

239
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:20,064
Whether he finally survived that combat,and spent the remainder of his days in some

240
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:29,049
Hotel des Invalides, I do not know; but Ithought that his industry would not be

241
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,034
worth much thereafter.

242
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:39,015
I never learned which party was victorious,nor the cause of the war; but I felt for

243
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:45,065
the rest of that day as if I had had myfeelings excited and harrowed by witnessing

244
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:54,919
the struggle, the ferocity and carnage, ofa human battle before my door.

245
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:01,015
Kirby and Spence tell us that the battlesof ants have long been celebrated and the

246
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:07,035
date of them recorded, though they say thatHuber is the only modern author who appears

247
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:10,049
to have witnessed them.

248
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:15,419
"Aeneas Sylvius," say they, "after giving avery circumstantial account of one

249
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,569
contested with great obstinacy by a greatand small species on the trunk of a pear

250
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:25,959
tree," adds that "this action was fought in

251
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:33,052
the pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, inthe presence of Nicholas Pistoriensis, an

252
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:37,037
eminent lawyer, who related the wholehistory of the battle with the greatest

253
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,004
fidelity."

254
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:45,099
A similar engagement between great andsmall ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in

255
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:51,059
which the small ones, being victorious, aresaid to have buried the bodies of their own

256
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:57,061
soldiers, but left those of their giantenemies a prey to the birds.

257
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:01,709
This event happened previous to theexpulsion of the tyrant Christiern the

258
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:04,089
Second from Sweden.

259
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:10,549
The battle which I witnessed took place inthe Presidency of Polk, five years before

260
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:15,439
the passage of Webster's Fugitive-SlaveBill.

261
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:22,027
Many a village Bose, fit only to course amud-turtle in a victualling cellar, sported

262
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:27,011
his heavy quarters in the woods, withoutthe knowledge of his master, and

263
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:29,939
ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows

264
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:37,199
and woodchucks' holes; led perchance bysome slight cur which nimbly threaded the

265
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:44,015
wood, and might still inspire a naturalterror in its denizens;--now far behind his

266
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,099
guide, barking like a canine bull toward

267
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:53,199
some small squirrel which had treed itselffor scrutiny, then, cantering off, bending

268
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:58,539
the bushes with his weight, imagining thathe is on the track of some stray member of

269
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,959
the jerbilla family.

270
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:07,053
Once I was surprised to see a cat walkingalong the stony shore of the pond, for they

271
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:14,169
rarely wander so far from home.The surprise was mutual.

272
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:20,159
Nevertheless the most domestic cat, whichhas lain on a rug all her days, appears

273
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:27,819
quite at home in the woods, and, by her slyand stealthy behavior, proves herself more

274
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:33,002
native there than the regular inhabitants.

275
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:39,052
Once, when berrying, I met with a cat withyoung kittens in the woods, quite wild, and

276
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:44,003
they all, like their mother, had theirbacks up and were fiercely spitting at me.

277
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:53,037
A few years before I lived in the woodsthere was what was called a "winged cat" in

278
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:59,039
one of the farm-houses in Lincoln nearestthe pond, Mr. Gilian Baker's.

279
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,059
When I called to see her in June, 1842, shewas gone a-hunting in the woods, as was her

280
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:11,001
wont (I am not sure whether it was a maleor female, and so use the more common

281
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:14,038
pronoun), but her mistress told me that she

282
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,026
came into the neighborhood a little morethan a year before, in April, and was

283
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:25,689
finally taken into their house; that shewas of a dark brownish-gray color, with a

284
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:29,039
white spot on her throat, and white feet,

285
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,039
and had a large bushy tail like a fox; thatin the winter the fur grew thick and

286
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:42,088
flatted out along her sides, formingstripes ten or twelve inches long by two

287
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:45,939
and a half wide, and under her chin like a

288
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:53,065
muff, the upper side loose, the undermatted like felt, and in the spring these

289
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:59,159
appendages dropped off.They gave me a pair of her "wings," which I

290
00:26:59,159 --> 00:26:59,073
keep still.

291
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:05,709
There is no appearance of a membrane aboutthem.

292
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:10,559
Some thought it was part flying squirrel orsome other wild animal, which is not

293
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,002
impossible, for, according to naturalists,prolific hybrids have been produced by the

294
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:20,549
union of the marten and domestic cat.

295
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,022
This would have been the right kind of catfor me to keep, if I had kept any; for why

296
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:32,159
should not a poet's cat be winged as wellas his horse?

297
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:39,077
In the fall the loon (Colymbus glacialis)came, as usual, to moult and bathe in the

298
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:44,319
pond, making the woods ring with his wildlaughter before I had risen.

299
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:52,429
At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-damsportsmen are on the alert, in gigs and on

300
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:58,559
foot, two by two and three by three, withpatent rifles and conical balls and spy-

301
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,439
glasses.

302
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:05,659
They come rustling through the woods likeautumn leaves, at least ten men to one

303
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,005
loon.

304
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:12,579
Some station themselves on this side of thepond, some on that, for the poor bird

305
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:19,679
cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here hemust come up there.

306
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,087
But now the kind October wind rises,rustling the leaves and rippling the

307
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:32,073
surface of the water, so that no loon canbe heard or seen, though his foes sweep the

308
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:39,085
pond with spy-glasses, and make the woodsresound with their discharges.

309
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:46,024
The waves generously rise and dash angrily,taking sides with all water-fowl, and our

310
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:54,037
sportsmen must beat a retreat to town andshop and unfinished jobs.

311
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:59,189
But they were too often successful.

312
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:03,077
When I went to get a pail of water early inthe morning I frequently saw this stately

313
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:09,789
bird sailing out of my cove within a fewrods.

314
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,689
If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat,in order to see how he would manoeuvre, he

315
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:20,065
would dive and be completely lost, so thatI did not discover him again, sometimes,

316
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:23,829
till the latter part of the day.

317
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,299
But I was more than a match for him on thesurface.

318
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,015
He commonly went off in a rain.

319
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:38,001
As I was paddling along the north shore onevery calm October afternoon, for such days

320
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:44,289
especially they settle on to the lakes,like the milkweed down, having looked in

321
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,309
vain over the pond for a loon, suddenly

322
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:53,709
one, sailing out from the shore toward themiddle a few rods in front of me, set up

323
00:29:53,709 --> 00:30:00,099
his wild laugh and betrayed himself.I pursued with a paddle and he dived, but

324
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:04,059
when he came up I was nearer than before.

325
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:10,059
He dived again, but I miscalculated thedirection he would take, and we were fifty

326
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:15,929
rods apart when he came to the surface thistime, for I had helped to widen the

327
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:22,799
interval; and again he laughed long andloud, and with more reason than before.

328
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:31,014
He manoeuvred so cunningly that I could notget within half a dozen rods of him.

329
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:35,809
Each time, when he came to the surface,turning his head this way and that, he

330
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:42,159
cooly surveyed the water and the land, andapparently chose his course so that he

331
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,024
might come up where there was the widest

332
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:49,529
expanse of water and at the greatestdistance from the boat.

333
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:53,419
It was surprising how quickly he made uphis mind and put his resolve into

334
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,086
execution.

335
00:30:55,086 --> 00:31:00,329
He led me at once to the widest part of thepond, and could not be driven from it.

336
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:05,064
While he was thinking one thing in hisbrain, I was endeavoring to divine his

337
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:07,899
thought in mine.

338
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:17,014
It was a pretty game, played on the smoothsurface of the pond, a man against a loon.

339
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:20,829
Suddenly your adversary's checkerdisappears beneath the board, and the

340
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:26,529
problem is to place yours nearest to wherehis will appear again.

341
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:30,048
Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly onthe opposite side of me, having apparently

342
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,399
passed directly under the boat.

343
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:39,051
So long-winded was he and so unweariable,that when he had swum farthest he would

344
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:46,439
immediately plunge again, nevertheless; andthen no wit could divine where in the deep

345
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:49,084
pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might

346
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:56,001
be speeding his way like a fish, for he hadtime and ability to visit the bottom of the

347
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,013
pond in its deepest part.

348
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:05,023
It is said that loons have been caught inthe New York lakes eighty feet beneath the

349
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:13,029
surface, with hooks set for trout--thoughWalden is deeper than that.

350
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:18,929
How surprised must the fishes be to seethis ungainly visitor from another sphere

351
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:23,069
speeding his way amid their schools!

352
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:27,649
Yet he appeared to know his course assurely under water as on the surface, and

353
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:31,024
swam much faster there.

354
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:35,087
Once or twice I saw a ripple where heapproached the surface, just put his head

355
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:40,072
out to reconnoitre, and instantly divedagain.

356
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:46,014
I found that it was as well for me to reston my oars and wait his reappearing as to

357
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:51,076
endeavor to calculate where he would rise;for again and again, when I was straining

358
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:54,036
my eyes over the surface one way, I would

359
00:32:54,036 --> 00:33:00,569
suddenly be startled by his unearthly laughbehind me.

360
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:06,939
But why, after displaying so much cunning,did he invariably betray himself the moment

361
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:11,049
he came up by that loud laugh?

362
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:19,062
Did not his white breast enough betray him?He was indeed a silly loon, I thought.

363
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:24,063
I could commonly hear the splash of thewater when he came up, and so also detected

364
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:25,076
him.

365
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:31,539
But after an hour he seemed as fresh asever, dived as willingly, and swam yet

366
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:34,579
farther than at first.

367
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:40,000
It was surprising to see how serenely hesailed off with unruffled breast when he

368
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,089
came to the surface, doing all the workwith his webbed feet beneath.

369
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:56,036
His usual note was this demoniac laughter,yet somewhat like that of a water-fowl; but

370
00:33:56,036 --> 00:34:01,779
occasionally, when he had balked me mostsuccessfully and come up a long way off, he

371
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:06,077
uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl,

372
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:12,069
probably more like that of a wolf than anybird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to

373
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:17,029
the ground and deliberately howls.

374
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:24,029
This was his looning--perhaps the wildestsound that is ever heard here, making the

375
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:30,088
woods ring far and wide.I concluded that he laughed in derision of

376
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:35,017
my efforts, confident of his own resources.

377
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:41,016
Though the sky was by this time overcast,the pond was so smooth that I could see

378
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:45,019
where he broke the surface when I did nothear him.

379
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:49,729
His white breast, the stillness of the air,and the smoothness of the water were all

380
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:52,012
against him.

381
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:58,709
At length having come up fifty rods off, heuttered one of those prolonged howls, as if

382
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:06,005
calling on the god of loons to aid him, andimmediately there came a wind from the east

383
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:08,029
and rippled the surface, and filled the

384
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:14,034
whole air with misty rain, and I wasimpressed as if it were the prayer of the

385
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:23,058
loon answered, and his god was angry withme; and so I left him disappearing far away

386
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,018
on the tumultuous surface.

387
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:32,092
For hours, in fall days, I watched theducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the

388
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:39,085
middle of the pond, far from the sportsman;tricks which they will have less need to

389
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:43,239
practise in Louisiana bayous.

390
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:49,032
When compelled to rise they would sometimescircle round and round and over the pond at

391
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:53,007
a considerable height, from which theycould easily see to other ponds and the

392
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:58,042
river, like black motes in the sky; and,

393
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:03,054
when I thought they had gone off thitherlong since, they would settle down by a

394
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:10,088
slanting flight of a quarter of a mile onto a distant part which was left free; but

395
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:13,088
what beside safety they got by sailing in

396
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:21,016
the middle of Walden I do not know, unlessthey love its water for the same reason

397
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:28,004
that I do.

398
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:29,004
>

399
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:41,023
CHAPTER 13House-Warming

400
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:46,689
In October I went a-graping to the rivermeadows, and loaded myself with clusters

401
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:51,749
more precious for their beauty andfragrance than for food.

402
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:59,061
There, too, I admired, though I did notgather, the cranberries, small waxen gems,

403
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:06,639
pendants of the meadow grass, pearly andred, which the farmer plucks with an ugly

404
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,018
rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl,

405
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:17,000
heedlessly measuring them by the bushel andthe dollar only, and sells the spoils of

406
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,065
the meads to Boston and New York; destinedto be jammed, to satisfy the tastes of

407
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:29,479
lovers of Nature there.

408
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:35,032
So butchers rake the tongues of bison outof the prairie grass, regardless of the

409
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:38,075
torn and drooping plant.

410
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:47,082
The barberry's brilliant fruit was likewisefood for my eyes merely; but I collected a

411
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:53,067
small store of wild apples for coddling,which the proprietor and travellers had

412
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,129
overlooked.

413
00:37:54,129 --> 00:38:00,097
When chestnuts were ripe I laid up half abushel for winter.

414
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:07,039
It was very exciting at that season to roamthe then boundless chestnut woods of

415
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:13,058
Lincoln--they now sleep their long sleepunder the railroad--with a bag on my

416
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:16,019
shoulder, and a stick to open burs with in

417
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:22,003
my hand, for I did not always wait for thefrost, amid the rustling of leaves and the

418
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:27,099
loud reproofs of the red squirrels and thejays, whose half-consumed nuts I sometimes

419
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:35,439
stole, for the burs which they had selectedwere sure to contain sound ones.

420
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,075
Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees.

421
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:45,639
They grew also behind my house, and onelarge tree, which almost overshadowed it,

422
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:51,069
was, when in flower, a bouquet whichscented the whole neighborhood, but the

423
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:53,016
squirrels and the jays got most of its

424
00:38:53,016 --> 00:38:59,066
fruit; the last coming in flocks early inthe morning and picking the nuts out of the

425
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:06,609
burs before they fell, I relinquished thesetrees to them and visited the more distant

426
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:09,003
woods composed wholly of chestnut.

427
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:11,003
These nuts, as far as they went, were agood substitute for bread.

428
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:15,056
Many other substitutes might, perhaps, befound.

429
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:21,009
Digging one day for fishworms, I discoveredthe ground-nut (Apios tuberosa) on its

430
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:28,099
string, the potato of the aborigines, asort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun

431
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,699
to doubt if I had ever dug and eaten in

432
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:36,077
childhood, as I had told, and had notdreamed it.

433
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:41,629
I had often since seen its crumpled redvelvety blossom supported by the stems of

434
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,025
other plants without knowing it to be thesame.

435
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:50,047
Cultivation has well-nigh exterminated it.

436
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:56,078
It has a sweetish taste, much like that ofa frost-bitten potato, and I found it

437
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:59,069
better boiled than roasted.

438
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:04,091
This tuber seemed like a faint promise ofNature to rear her own children and feed

439
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:07,379
them simply here at some future period.

440
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:15,046
In these days of fatted cattle and wavinggrain-fields this humble root, which was

441
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:22,044
once the totem of an Indian tribe, is quiteforgotten, or known only by its flowering

442
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:27,043
vine; but let wild Nature reign here once

443
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:33,077
more, and the tender and luxurious Englishgrains will probably disappear before a

444
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:39,097
myriad of foes, and without the care of manthe crow may carry back even the last seed

445
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:42,077
of corn to the great cornfield of the

446
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:49,031
Indian's God in the southwest, whence he issaid to have brought it; but the now almost

447
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:56,006
exterminated ground-nut will perhaps reviveand flourish in spite of frosts and

448
00:40:56,006 --> 00:41:00,009
wildness, prove itself indigenous, and

449
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:07,072
resume its ancient importance and dignityas the diet of the hunter tribe.

450
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:15,002
Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have beenthe inventor and bestower of it; and when

451
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:20,068
the reign of poetry commences here, itsleaves and string of nuts may be

452
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:25,004
represented on our works of art.

453
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:29,099
Already, by the first of September, I hadseen two or three small maples turned

454
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:37,065
scarlet across the pond, beneath where thewhite stems of three aspens diverged, at

455
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:40,033
the point of a promontory, next the water.

456
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:47,099
Ah, many a tale their color told!And gradually from week to week the

457
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:53,072
character of each tree came out, and itadmired itself reflected in the smooth

458
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:56,016
mirror of the lake.

459
00:41:56,016 --> 00:42:02,074
Each morning the manager of this gallerysubstituted some new picture, distinguished

460
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:10,007
by more brilliant or harmonious coloring,for the old upon the walls.

461
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:16,079
The wasps came by thousands to my lodge inOctober, as to winter quarters, and settled

462
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,049
on my windows within and on the wallsoverhead, sometimes deterring visitors from

463
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:23,093
entering.

464
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:30,004
Each morning, when they were numbed withcold, I swept some of them out, but I did

465
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:35,039
not trouble myself much to get rid of them;I even felt complimented by their regarding

466
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,009
my house as a desirable shelter.

467
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:44,043
They never molested me seriously, thoughthey bedded with me; and they gradually

468
00:42:44,043 --> 00:42:53,071
disappeared, into what crevices I do notknow, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.

469
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:59,066
Like the wasps, before I finally went intowinter quarters in November, I used to

470
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:05,048
resort to the northeast side of Walden,which the sun, reflected from the pitch

471
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:08,038
pine woods and the stony shore, made the

472
00:43:08,038 --> 00:43:13,789
fireside of the pond; it is so muchpleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by

473
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:17,043
the sun while you can be, than by anartificial fire.

474
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:24,051
I thus warmed myself by the still glowingembers which the summer, like a departed

475
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:30,051
hunter, had left.When I came to build my chimney I studied

476
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:31,093
masonry.

477
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:37,061
My bricks, being second-hand ones, requiredto be cleaned with a trowel, so that I

478
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:42,052
learned more than usual of the qualities ofbricks and trowels.

479
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:48,008
The mortar on them was fifty years old, andwas said to be still growing harder; but

480
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:53,069
this is one of those sayings which men loveto repeat whether they are true or not.

481
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:59,083
Such sayings themselves grow harder andadhere more firmly with age, and it would

482
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:06,001
take many blows with a trowel to clean anold wiseacre of them.

483
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:10,094
Many of the villages of Mesopotamia arebuilt of second-hand bricks of a very good

484
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:16,086
quality, obtained from the ruins ofBabylon, and the cement on them is older

485
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,036
and probably harder still.

486
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:25,077
However that may be, I was struck by thepeculiar toughness of the steel which bore

487
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:30,044
so many violent blows without being wornout.

488
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:35,096
As my bricks had been in a chimney before,though I did not read the name of

489
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:42,086
Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out asmany fireplace bricks as I could find, to

490
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:45,043
save work and waste, and I filled the

491
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:50,056
spaces between the bricks about thefireplace with stones from the pond shore,

492
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:57,027
and also made my mortar with the white sandfrom the same place.

493
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:03,669
I lingered most about the fireplace, as themost vital part of the house.

494
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:09,061
Indeed, I worked so deliberately, thatthough I commenced at the ground in the

495
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:14,092
morning, a course of bricks raised a fewinches above the floor served for my pillow

496
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:18,067
at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck

497
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:24,003
for it that I remember; my stiff neck is ofolder date.

498
00:45:24,003 --> 00:45:31,036
I took a poet to board for a fortnightabout those times, which caused me to be

499
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:34,002
put to it for room.

500
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:39,058
He brought his own knife, though I had two,and we used to scour them by thrusting them

501
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:44,025
into the earth.He shared with me the labors of cooking.

502
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:51,001
I was pleased to see my work rising sosquare and solid by degrees, and reflected,

503
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:58,065
that, if it proceeded slowly, it wascalculated to endure a long time.

504
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:02,088
The chimney is to some extent anindependent structure, standing on the

505
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:09,047
ground, and rising through the house to theheavens; even after the house is burned it

506
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:15,679
still stands sometimes, and its importanceand independence are apparent.

507
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:21,091
This was toward the end of summer.It was now November.

508
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:26,083
The north wind had already begun to coolthe pond, though it took many weeks of

509
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:30,004
steady blowing to accomplish it, it is sodeep.

510
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:36,054
When I began to have a fire at evening,before I plastered my house, the chimney

511
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:42,072
carried smoke particularly well, because ofthe numerous chinks between the boards.

512
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:48,085
Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in thatcool and airy apartment, surrounded by the

513
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:55,083
rough brown boards full of knots, andrafters with the bark on high overhead.

514
00:46:55,083 --> 00:47:01,064
My house never pleased my eye so much afterit was plastered, though I was obliged to

515
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:04,098
confess that it was more comfortable.

516
00:47:04,098 --> 00:47:09,064
Should not every apartment in which mandwells be lofty enough to create some

517
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:15,045
obscurity overhead, where flickeringshadows may play at evening about the

518
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:17,065
rafters?

519
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:22,051
These forms are more agreeable to the fancyand imagination than fresco paintings or

520
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:28,084
other the most expensive furniture.

521
00:47:28,084 --> 00:47:36,429
I now first began to inhabit my house, Imay say, when I began to use it for warmth

522
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:39,015
as well as shelter.

523
00:47:39,015 --> 00:47:44,549
I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keepthe wood from the hearth, and it did me

524
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:51,015
good to see the soot form on the back ofthe chimney which I had built, and I poked

525
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:55,095
the fire with more right and moresatisfaction than usual.

526
00:47:55,095 --> 00:48:01,096
My dwelling was small, and I could hardlyentertain an echo in it; but it seemed

527
00:48:01,096 --> 00:48:06,089
larger for being a single apartment andremote from neighbors.

528
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:12,009
All the attractions of a house wereconcentrated in one room; it was kitchen,

529
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:18,049
chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; andwhatever satisfaction parent or child,

530
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:24,064
master or servant, derive from living in ahouse, I enjoyed it all.

531
00:48:24,064 --> 00:48:31,077
Cato says, the master of a family(patremfamilias) must have in his rustic

532
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:44,023
villa "cellam oleariam, vinariam, doliamulta, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et

533
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:51,002
rei, et virtuti, et gloriae erit," that is,

534
00:48:51,002 --> 00:48:56,095
"an oil and wine cellar, many casks, sothat it may be pleasant to expect hard

535
00:48:56,095 --> 00:49:03,095
times; it will be for his advantage, andvirtue, and glory."

536
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:11,062
I had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes,about two quarts of peas with the weevil in

537
00:49:11,062 --> 00:49:18,084
them, and on my shelf a little rice, a jugof molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a

538
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,062
peck each.

539
00:49:19,062 --> 00:49:27,076
I sometimes dream of a larger and morepopulous house, standing in a golden age,

540
00:49:27,076 --> 00:49:33,179
of enduring materials, and withoutgingerbread work, which shall still consist

541
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,013
of only one room, a vast, rude,

542
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:44,058
substantial, primitive hall, withoutceiling or plastering, with bare rafters

543
00:49:44,058 --> 00:49:50,078
and purlins supporting a sort of lowerheaven over one's head--useful to keep off

544
00:49:50,078 --> 00:49:53,073
rain and snow, where the king and queen

545
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:59,000
posts stand out to receive your homage,when you have done reverence to the

546
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,046
prostrate Saturn of an older dynasty onstepping over the sill; a cavernous house,

547
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:09,001
wherein you must reach up a torch upon a

548
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:15,035
pole to see the roof; where some may livein the fireplace, some in the recess of a

549
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:22,033
window, and some on settles, some at oneend of the hall, some at another, and some

550
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:25,047
aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they

551
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:33,013
choose; a house which you have got intowhen you have opened the outside door, and

552
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:38,919
the ceremony is over; where the wearytraveller may wash, and eat, and converse,

553
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:43,071
and sleep, without further journey; such a

554
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:50,002
shelter as you would be glad to reach in atempestuous night, containing all the

555
00:50:50,002 --> 00:50:56,076
essentials of a house, and nothing forhouse-keeping; where you can see all the

556
00:50:56,076 --> 00:50:59,044
treasures of the house at one view, and

557
00:50:59,044 --> 00:51:05,489
everything hangs upon its peg, that a manshould use; at once kitchen, pantry,

558
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:13,419
parlor, chamber, storehouse, and garret;where you can see so necessary a thing, as

559
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:17,002
a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing

560
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:22,032
as a cupboard, and hear the pot boil, andpay your respects to the fire that cooks

561
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:27,057
your dinner, and the oven that bakes yourbread, and the necessary furniture and

562
00:51:27,057 --> 00:51:31,419
utensils are the chief ornaments; where the

563
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:37,044
washing is not put out, nor the fire, northe mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes

564
00:51:37,044 --> 00:51:42,008
requested to move from off the trap-door,when the cook would descend into the

565
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:44,095
cellar, and so learn whether the ground is

566
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:48,489
solid or hollow beneath you withoutstamping.

567
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:55,077
A house whose inside is as open andmanifest as a bird's nest, and you cannot

568
00:51:55,077 --> 00:52:03,007
go in at the front door and out at the backwithout seeing some of its inhabitants;

569
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:06,049
where to be a guest is to be presented with

570
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:11,075
the freedom of the house, and not to becarefully excluded from seven eighths of

571
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:17,005
it, shut up in a particular cell, and toldto make yourself at home there--in solitary

572
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:19,739
confinement.

573
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:25,007
Nowadays the host does not admit you to hishearth, but has got the mason to build one

574
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:31,919
for yourself somewhere in his alley, andhospitality is the art of keeping you at

575
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,007
the greatest distance.

576
00:52:33,007 --> 00:52:41,057
There is as much secrecy about the cookingas if he had a design to poison you.

577
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:47,034
I am aware that I have been on many a man'spremises, and might have been legally

578
00:52:47,034 --> 00:52:55,072
ordered off, but I am not aware that I havebeen in many men's houses.

579
00:52:55,072 --> 00:53:02,003
I might visit in my old clothes a king andqueen who lived simply in such a house as I

580
00:53:02,003 --> 00:53:07,076
have described, if I were going their way;but backing out of a modern palace will be

581
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:13,239
all that I shall desire to learn, if ever Iam caught in one.

582
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:20,002
It would seem as if the very language ofour parlors would lose all its nerve and

583
00:53:20,002 --> 00:53:26,169
degenerate into palaver wholly, our livespass at such remoteness from its symbols,

584
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,859
and its metaphors and tropes are

585
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:35,549
necessarily so far fetched, through slidesand dumb-waiters, as it were; in other

586
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:39,819
words, the parlor is so far from thekitchen and workshop.

587
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:47,539
The dinner even is only the parable of adinner, commonly.

588
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:53,579
As if only the savage dwelt near enough toNature and Truth to borrow a trope from

589
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,509
them.

590
00:53:55,509 --> 00:54:02,949
How can the scholar, who dwells away in theNorth West Territory or the Isle of Man,

591
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:07,819
tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen?

592
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:13,062
However, only one or two of my guests wereever bold enough to stay and eat a hasty-

593
00:54:13,062 --> 00:54:19,829
pudding with me; but when they saw thatcrisis approaching they beat a hasty

594
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:25,088
retreat rather, as if it would shake thehouse to its foundations.

595
00:54:25,088 --> 00:54:32,049
Nevertheless, it stood through a great manyhasty-puddings.

596
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:37,169
I did not plaster till it was freezingweather.

597
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:43,001
I brought over some whiter and cleaner sandfor this purpose from the opposite shore of

598
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:48,000
the pond in a boat, a sort of conveyancewhich would have tempted me to go much

599
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,939
farther if necessary.

600
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:55,048
My house had in the meanwhile been shingleddown to the ground on every side.

601
00:54:55,048 --> 00:55:02,073
In lathing I was pleased to be able to sendhome each nail with a single blow of the

602
00:55:02,073 --> 00:55:07,075
hammer, and it was my ambition to transferthe plaster from the board to the wall

603
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:09,059
neatly and rapidly.

604
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:15,006
I remembered the story of a conceitedfellow, who, in fine clothes, was wont to

605
00:55:15,006 --> 00:55:20,048
lounge about the village once, givingadvice to workmen.

606
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:26,009
Venturing one day to substitute deeds forwords, he turned up his cuffs, seized a

607
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:31,389
plasterer's board, and having loaded histrowel without mishap, with a complacent

608
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:33,949
look toward the lathing overhead, made a

609
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:40,709
bold gesture thitherward; and straightway,to his complete discomfiture, received the

610
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:44,759
whole contents in his ruffled bosom.

611
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:50,679
I admired anew the economy and convenienceof plastering, which so effectually shuts

612
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:56,072
out the cold and takes a handsome finish,and I learned the various casualties to

613
00:55:56,072 --> 00:55:59,098
which the plasterer is liable.

614
00:55:59,098 --> 00:56:04,389
I was surprised to see how thirsty thebricks were which drank up all the moisture

615
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:09,759
in my plaster before I had smoothed it, andhow many pailfuls of water it takes to

616
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:12,035
christen a new hearth.

617
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:17,409
I had the previous winter made a smallquantity of lime by burning the shells of

618
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:24,012
the Unio fluviatilis, which our riveraffords, for the sake of the experiment; so

619
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:27,075
that I knew where my materials came from.

620
00:56:27,075 --> 00:56:32,779
I might have got good limestone within amile or two and burned it myself, if I had

621
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:33,439
cared to do so.

622
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:40,199
The pond had in the meanwhile skimmed overin the shadiest and shallowest coves, some

623
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,879
days or even weeks before the generalfreezing.

624
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:51,139
The first ice is especially interesting andperfect, being hard, dark, and transparent,

625
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:55,919
and affords the best opportunity that everoffers for examining the bottom where it is

626
00:56:55,919 --> 00:56:59,189
shallow; for you can lie at your length on

627
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:05,949
ice only an inch thick, like a skaterinsect on the surface of the water, and

628
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:11,209
study the bottom at your leisure, only twoor three inches distant, like a picture

629
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:17,059
behind a glass, and the water isnecessarily always smooth then.

630
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:22,259
There are many furrows in the sand wheresome creature has travelled about and

631
00:57:22,259 --> 00:57:30,899
doubled on its tracks; and, for wrecks, itis strewn with the cases of caddis-worms

632
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:35,559
made of minute grains of white quartz.

633
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:41,009
Perhaps these have creased it, for you findsome of their cases in the furrows, though

634
00:57:41,009 --> 00:57:45,001
they are deep and broad for them to make.

635
00:57:45,001 --> 00:57:50,047
But the ice itself is the object of mostinterest, though you must improve the

636
00:57:50,047 --> 00:57:52,309
earliest opportunity to study it.

637
00:57:52,309 --> 00:58:00,649
If you examine it closely the morning afterit freezes, you find that the greater part

638
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:08,029
of the bubbles, which at first appeared tobe within it, are against its under

639
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:11,879
surface, and that more are continually

640
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:19,048
rising from the bottom; while the ice is asyet comparatively solid and dark, that is,

641
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:22,409
you see the water through it.

642
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:29,509
These bubbles are from an eightieth to aneighth of an inch in diameter, very clear

643
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:35,779
and beautiful, and you see your facereflected in them through the ice.

644
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:40,209
There may be thirty or forty of them to asquare inch.

645
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:46,919
There are also already within the icenarrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about

646
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:54,079
half an inch long, sharp cones with theapex upward; or oftener, if the ice is

647
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,309
quite fresh, minute spherical bubbles one

648
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:02,035
directly above another, like a string ofbeads.

649
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:08,539
But these within the ice are not sonumerous nor obvious as those beneath.

650
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:14,319
I sometimes used to cast on stones to trythe strength of the ice, and those which

651
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:20,034
broke through carried in air with them,which formed very large and conspicuous

652
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:23,029
white bubbles beneath.

653
00:59:23,029 --> 00:59:28,449
One day when I came to the same placeforty-eight hours afterward, I found that

654
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:35,000
those large bubbles were still perfect,though an inch more of ice had formed, as I

655
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,179
could see distinctly by the seam in theedge of a cake.

656
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:44,037
But as the last two days had been verywarm, like an Indian summer, the ice was

657
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:51,569
not now transparent, showing the dark greencolor of the water, and the bottom, but

658
00:59:51,569 --> 00:59:54,959
opaque and whitish or gray, and though

659
00:59:54,959 --> 01:00:00,097
twice as thick was hardly stronger thanbefore, for the air bubbles had greatly

660
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:06,539
expanded under this heat and run together,and lost their regularity; they were no

661
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:10,579
longer one directly over another, but often

662
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:18,049
like silvery coins poured from a bag, oneoverlapping another, or in thin flakes, as

663
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:25,073
if occupying slight cleavages.The beauty of the ice was gone, and it was

664
01:00:25,073 --> 01:00:28,689
too late to study the bottom.

665
01:00:28,689 --> 01:00:34,048
Being curious to know what position mygreat bubbles occupied with regard to the

666
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:40,659
new ice, I broke out a cake containing amiddling sized one, and turned it bottom

667
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:42,069
upward.

668
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:49,529
The new ice had formed around and under thebubble, so that it was included between the

669
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:51,769
two ices.

670
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:58,098
It was wholly in the lower ice, but closeagainst the upper, and was flattish, or

671
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:04,037
perhaps slightly lenticular, with a roundededge, a quarter of an inch deep by four

672
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:07,061
inches in diameter; and I was surprised to

673
01:01:07,061 --> 01:01:14,309
find that directly under the bubble the icewas melted with great regularity in the

674
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:20,829
form of a saucer reversed, to the height offive eighths of an inch in the middle,

675
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:24,279
leaving a thin partition there between the

676
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:30,829
water and the bubble, hardly an eighth ofan inch thick; and in many places the small

677
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:37,179
bubbles in this partition had burst outdownward, and probably there was no ice at

678
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:42,799
all under the largest bubbles, which were afoot in diameter.

679
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:47,062
I inferred that the infinite number ofminute bubbles which I had first seen

680
01:01:47,062 --> 01:01:54,389
against the under surface of the ice werenow frozen in likewise, and that each, in

681
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:57,459
its degree, had operated like a burning-

682
01:01:57,459 --> 01:02:02,759
glass on the ice beneath to melt and rotit.

683
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:10,023
These are the little air-guns whichcontribute to make the ice crack and whoop.

684
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:15,709
At length the winter set in good earnest,just as I had finished plastering, and the

685
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:21,289
wind began to howl around the house as ifit had not had permission to do so till

686
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:22,949
then.

687
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:29,009
Night after night the geese came lumberingin the dark with a clangor and a whistling

688
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:35,649
of wings, even after the ground was coveredwith snow, some to alight in Walden, and

689
01:02:35,649 --> 01:02:42,001
some flying low over the woods toward FairHaven, bound for Mexico.

690
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:45,779
Several times, when returning from thevillage at ten or eleven o'clock at night,

691
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:53,309
I heard the tread of a flock of geese, orelse ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods

692
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:56,929
by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where

693
01:02:56,929 --> 01:03:02,139
they had come up to feed, and the fainthonk or quack of their leader as they

694
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:04,159
hurried off.

695
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:11,019
In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for thefirst time on the night of the 22d of

696
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:17,829
December, Flint's and other shallower pondsand the river having been frozen ten days

697
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:25,022
or more; in '46, the 16th; in '49, about

698
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:35,039
the 31st; and in '50, about the 27th ofDecember; in '52, the 5th of January; in

699
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,889
'53, the 31st of December.

700
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:44,279
The snow had already covered the groundsince the 25th of November, and surrounded

701
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,899
me suddenly with the scenery of winter.

702
01:03:47,899 --> 01:03:53,039
I withdrew yet farther into my shell, andendeavored to keep a bright fire both

703
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,259
within my house and within my breast.

704
01:03:56,259 --> 01:04:01,189
My employment out of doors now was tocollect the dead wood in the forest,

705
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:06,035
bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders,or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree

706
01:04:06,035 --> 01:04:09,119
under each arm to my shed.

707
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:16,389
An old forest fence which had seen its bestdays was a great haul for me.

708
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:21,074
I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was pastserving the god Terminus.

709
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:30,619
How much more interesting an event is thatman's supper who has just been forth in the

710
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:36,097
snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal,the fuel to cook it with!

711
01:04:36,097 --> 01:04:40,249
His bread and meat are sweet.

712
01:04:40,249 --> 01:04:45,809
There are enough fagots and waste wood ofall kinds in the forests of most of our

713
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:52,579
towns to support many fires, but which atpresent warm none, and, some think, hinder

714
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:55,047
the growth of the young wood.

715
01:04:55,047 --> 01:05:00,098
There was also the driftwood of the pond.In the course of the summer I had

716
01:05:00,098 --> 01:05:07,073
discovered a raft of pitch pine logs withthe bark on, pinned together by the Irish

717
01:05:07,073 --> 01:05:09,429
when the railroad was built.

718
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:16,799
This I hauled up partly on the shore.After soaking two years and then lying high

719
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:23,006
six months it was perfectly sound, thoughwaterlogged past drying.

720
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:29,929
I amused myself one winter day with slidingthis piecemeal across the pond, nearly half

721
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:36,289
a mile, skating behind with one end of alog fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and

722
01:05:36,289 --> 01:05:39,819
the other on the ice; or I tied several

723
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:48,559
logs together with a birch withe, and then,with a longer birch or alder which had a

724
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,689
hook at the end, dragged them across.

725
01:05:52,689 --> 01:05:58,119
Though completely waterlogged and almost asheavy as lead, they not only burned long,

726
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:03,059
but made a very hot fire; nay, I thoughtthat they burned better for the soaking, as

727
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:10,379
if the pitch, being confined by the water,burned longer, as in a lamp.

728
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:16,074
Gilpin, in his account of the forestborderers of England, says that "the

729
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:21,949
encroachments of trespassers, and thehouses and fences thus raised on the

730
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:25,419
borders of the forest," were "considered as

731
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:31,759
great nuisances by the old forest law, andwere severely punished under the name of

732
01:06:31,759 --> 01:06:44,279
purprestures, as tending ad terroremferarum--ad nocumentum forestae, etc.," to

733
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:48,879
the frightening of the game and thedetriment of the forest.

734
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:54,999
But I was interested in the preservation ofthe venison and the vert more than the

735
01:06:54,999 --> 01:07:03,539
hunters or woodchoppers, and as much asthough I had been the Lord Warden himself;

736
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:05,073
and if any part was burned, though I burned

737
01:07:05,073 --> 01:07:12,669
it myself by accident, I grieved with agrief that lasted longer and was more

738
01:07:12,669 --> 01:07:19,829
inconsolable than that of the proprietors;nay, I grieved when it was cut down by the

739
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:21,119
proprietors themselves.

740
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:29,024
I would that our farmers when they cut downa forest felt some of that awe which the

741
01:07:29,024 --> 01:07:38,289
old Romans did when they came to thin, orlet in the light to, a consecrated grove

742
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:48,369
(lucum conlucare), that is, would believethat it is sacred to some god.

743
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:55,559
The Roman made an expiatory offering, andprayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to

744
01:07:55,559 --> 01:08:03,072
whom this grove is sacred, be propitious tome, my family, and children, etc.

745
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:09,072
It is remarkable what a value is still putupon wood even in this age and in this new

746
01:08:09,072 --> 01:08:16,189
country, a value more permanent anduniversal than that of gold.

747
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:23,909
After all our discoveries and inventions noman will go by a pile of wood.

748
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:31,189
It is as precious to us as it was to ourSaxon and Norman ancestors.

749
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:36,379
If they made their bows of it, we make ourgun-stocks of it.

750
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:41,959
Michaux, more than thirty years ago, saysthat the price of wood for fuel in New York

751
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:47,939
and Philadelphia "nearly equals, andsometimes exceeds, that of the best wood in

752
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:51,389
Paris, though this immense capital annually

753
01:08:51,389 --> 01:08:57,069
requires more than three hundred thousandcords, and is surrounded to the distance of

754
01:08:57,069 --> 01:09:01,439
three hundred miles by cultivated plains."

755
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:07,679
In this town the price of wood rises almoststeadily, and the only question is, how

756
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,699
much higher it is to be this year than itwas the last.

757
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:18,639
Mechanics and tradesmen who come in personto the forest on no other errand, are sure

758
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:24,509
to attend the wood auction, and even pay ahigh price for the privilege of gleaning

759
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:27,079
after the woodchopper.

760
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:32,529
It is now many years that men have resortedto the forest for fuel and the materials of

761
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:39,889
the arts: the New Englander and the NewHollander, the Parisian and the Celt, the

762
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:43,079
farmer and Robin Hood, Goody Blake and

763
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:49,939
Harry Gill; in most parts of the world theprince and the peasant, the scholar and the

764
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:56,059
savage, equally require still a few sticksfrom the forest to warm them and cook their

765
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:58,379
food.

766
01:09:58,379 --> 01:10:03,549
Neither could I do without them.Every man looks at his wood-pile with a

767
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:05,559
kind of affection.

768
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:12,059
I love to have mine before my window, andthe more chips the better to remind me of

769
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:14,519
my pleasing work.

770
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:21,119
I had an old axe which nobody claimed, withwhich by spells in winter days, on the

771
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,999
sunny side of the house, I played about thestumps which I had got out of my bean-

772
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,369
field.

773
01:10:28,369 --> 01:10:34,489
As my driver prophesied when I was plowing,they warmed me twice--once while I was

774
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:40,019
splitting them, and again when they were onthe fire, so that no fuel could give out

775
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:41,095
more heat.

776
01:10:41,095 --> 01:10:48,002
As for the axe, I was advised to get thevillage blacksmith to "jump" it; but I

777
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:53,022
jumped him, and, putting a hickory helvefrom the woods into it, made it do.

778
01:10:53,022 --> 01:10:59,034
If it was dull, it was at least hung true.

779
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:03,062
A few pieces of fat pine were a greattreasure.

780
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:08,549
It is interesting to remember how much ofthis food for fire is still concealed in

781
01:11:08,549 --> 01:11:09,087
the bowels of the earth.

782
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:16,091
In previous years I had often goneprospecting over some bare hillside, where

783
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:23,026
a pitch pine wood had formerly stood, andgot out the fat pine roots.

784
01:11:23,026 --> 01:11:25,072
They are almost indestructible.

785
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:31,061
Stumps thirty or forty years old, at least,will still be sound at the core, though the

786
01:11:31,061 --> 01:11:37,055
sapwood has all become vegetable mould, asappears by the scales of the thick bark

787
01:11:37,055 --> 01:11:44,062
forming a ring level with the earth four orfive inches distant from the heart.

788
01:11:44,062 --> 01:11:51,024
With axe and shovel you explore this mine,and follow the marrowy store, yellow as

789
01:11:51,024 --> 01:11:58,056
beef tallow, or as if you had struck on avein of gold, deep into the earth.

790
01:11:58,056 --> 01:12:04,027
But commonly I kindled my fire with the dryleaves of the forest, which I had stored up

791
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:07,065
in my shed before the snow came.

792
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:13,009
Green hickory finely split makes thewoodchopper's kindlings, when he has a camp

793
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:18,041
in the woods.Once in a while I got a little of this.

794
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:23,074
When the villagers were lighting theirfires beyond the horizon, I too gave notice

795
01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:31,017
to the various wild inhabitants of Waldenvale, by a smoky streamer from my chimney,

796
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:31,086
that I was awake.--

797
01:12:31,086 --> 01:12:42,072
Light-winged Smoke, Icarian bird,Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,

798
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:50,043
Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;

799
01:12:50,043 --> 01:12:57,061
Or else, departing dream, and shadowy formOf midnight vision, gathering up thy

800
01:12:57,061 --> 01:13:02,021
skirts;By night star-veiling, and by day

801
01:13:02,021 --> 01:13:06,003
Darkening the light and blotting out thesun;

802
01:13:06,003 --> 01:13:15,029
Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,And ask the gods to pardon this clear

803
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:17,007
flame.

804
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:23,001
Hard green wood just cut, though I used butlittle of that, answered my purpose better

805
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:24,075
than any other.

806
01:13:24,075 --> 01:13:30,027
I sometimes left a good fire when I went totake a walk in a winter afternoon; and when

807
01:13:30,027 --> 01:13:36,004
I returned, three or four hours afterward,it would be still alive and glowing.

808
01:13:36,004 --> 01:13:39,045
My house was not empty though I was gone.

809
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:43,034
It was as if I had left a cheerfulhousekeeper behind.

810
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:52,005
It was I and Fire that lived there; andcommonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy.

811
01:13:52,005 --> 01:13:57,051
One day, however, as I was splitting wood,I thought that I would just look in at the

812
01:13:57,051 --> 01:14:02,078
window and see if the house was not onfire; it was the only time I remember to

813
01:14:02,078 --> 01:14:05,081
have been particularly anxious on this

814
01:14:05,081 --> 01:14:13,036
score; so I looked and saw that a spark hadcaught my bed, and I went in and

815
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:18,064
extinguished it when it had burned a placeas big as my hand.

816
01:14:18,064 --> 01:14:24,015
But my house occupied so sunny andsheltered a position, and its roof was so

817
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:30,004
low, that I could afford to let the fire goout in the middle of almost any winter day.

818
01:14:30,004 --> 01:14:37,019
The moles nested in my cellar, nibblingevery third potato, and making a snug bed

819
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:43,007
even there of some hair left afterplastering and of brown paper; for even the

820
01:14:43,007 --> 01:14:45,047
wildest animals love comfort and warmth as

821
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:51,018
well as man, and they survive the winteronly because they are so careful to secure

822
01:14:51,018 --> 01:14:56,005
them.Some of my friends spoke as if I was coming

823
01:14:56,005 --> 01:14:59,065
to the woods on purpose to freeze myself.

824
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:06,044
The animal merely makes a bed, which hewarms with his body, in a sheltered place;

825
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:12,041
but man, having discovered fire, boxes upsome air in a spacious apartment, and warms

826
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:16,029
that, instead of robbing himself, makes

827
01:15:16,029 --> 01:15:22,027
that his bed, in which he can move aboutdivested of more cumbrous clothing,

828
01:15:22,027 --> 01:15:29,001
maintain a kind of summer in the midst ofwinter, and by means of windows even admit

829
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:33,089
the light, and with a lamp lengthen out theday.

830
01:15:33,089 --> 01:15:40,071
Thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct,and saves a little time for the fine arts.

831
01:15:40,071 --> 01:15:48,026
Though, when I had been exposed to therudest blasts a long time, my whole body

832
01:15:48,026 --> 01:15:55,045
began to grow torpid, when I reached thegenial atmosphere of my house I soon

833
01:15:55,045 --> 01:15:59,007
recovered my faculties and prolonged mylife.

834
01:15:59,007 --> 01:16:06,009
But the most luxuriously housed has littleto boast of in this respect, nor need we

835
01:16:06,009 --> 01:16:12,078
trouble ourselves to speculate how thehuman race may be at last destroyed.

836
01:16:12,078 --> 01:16:18,098
It would be easy to cut their threads anytime with a little sharper blast from the

837
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:20,078
north.

838
01:16:20,078 --> 01:16:28,078
We go on dating from Cold Fridays and GreatSnows; but a little colder Friday, or

839
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:37,029
greater snow would put a period to man'sexistence on the globe.

840
01:16:37,029 --> 01:16:42,077
The next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did not own the

841
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:48,065
forest; but it did not keep fire so well asthe open fireplace.

842
01:16:48,065 --> 01:16:54,003
Cooking was then, for the most part, nolonger a poetic, but merely a chemic

843
01:16:54,003 --> 01:16:56,026
process.

844
01:16:56,026 --> 01:17:01,017
It will soon be forgotten, in these days ofstoves, that we used to roast potatoes in

845
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:04,004
the ashes, after the Indian fashion.

846
01:17:04,004 --> 01:17:11,011
The stove not only took up room and scentedthe house, but it concealed the fire, and I

847
01:17:11,011 --> 01:17:18,027
felt as if I had lost a companion.You can always see a face in the fire.

848
01:17:18,027 --> 01:17:23,012
The laborer, looking into it at evening,purifies his thoughts of the dross and

849
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:28,047
earthiness which they have accumulatedduring the day.

850
01:17:28,047 --> 01:17:34,005
But I could no longer sit and look into thefire, and the pertinent words of a poet

851
01:17:34,005 --> 01:17:38,046
recurred to me with new force.--

852
01:17:38,046 --> 01:17:48,019
"Never, bright flame, may be denied to meThy dear, life imaging, close sympathy.

853
01:17:48,019 --> 01:17:52,041
What but my hopes shot upwarde'er so bright?

854
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:58,072
What but my fortunes sunkso low in night?

855
01:17:58,072 --> 01:18:03,003
Why art thou banished fromour hearth and hall,

856
01:18:03,003 --> 01:18:08,074
Thou who art welcomedand beloved by all?

857
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:14,027
Was thy existence then too fancifulFor our life's common light,

858
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:16,003
who are so dull?

859
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:20,077
Did thy bright gleam mysteriousconverse hold

860
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:27,088
With our congenial souls?secrets too bold?

861
01:18:27,088 --> 01:18:32,085
Well, we are safe and strong,for now we sit

862
01:18:32,085 --> 01:18:38,025
Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit,

863
01:18:38,025 --> 01:18:42,085
Where nothing cheers nor saddens,but a fire

864
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:49,019
Warms feet and handsnor does to more aspire;

865
01:18:49,019 --> 01:18:58,053
By whose compact utilitarian heapThe present may sit down and go to sleep,

866
01:18:58,053 --> 01:19:03,052
Nor fear the ghostswho from the dim past walked,

867
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:16,004
And with us by the unequal light of the oldwood fire talked."

868
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:17,004
>

869
01:19:17,004 --> 01:19:32,009
CHAPTER 14Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors

870
01:19:32,009 --> 01:19:36,097
I weathered some merry snow-storms, andspent some cheerful winter evenings by my

871
01:19:36,097 --> 01:19:43,055
fireside, while the snow whirled wildlywithout, and even the hooting of the owl

872
01:19:43,055 --> 01:19:45,499
was hushed.

873
01:19:45,499 --> 01:19:52,013
For many weeks I met no one in my walks butthose who came occasionally to cut wood and

874
01:19:52,013 --> 01:19:55,349
sled it to the village.

875
01:19:55,349 --> 01:20:00,003
The elements, however, abetted me in makinga path through the deepest snow in the

876
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:06,065
woods, for when I had once gone through thewind blew the oak leaves into my tracks,

877
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:09,169
where they lodged, and by absorbing the

878
01:20:09,169 --> 01:20:16,023
rays of the sun melted the snow, and so notonly made a my bed for my feet, but in the

879
01:20:16,023 --> 01:20:23,839
night their dark line was my guide.For human society I was obliged to conjure

880
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:28,064
up the former occupants of these woods.

881
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:33,069
Within the memory of many of my townsmenthe road near which my house stands

882
01:20:33,069 --> 01:20:39,007
resounded with the laugh and gossip ofinhabitants, and the woods which border it

883
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,083
were notched and dotted here and there with

884
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:47,063
their little gardens and dwellings, thoughit was then much more shut in by the forest

885
01:20:47,063 --> 01:20:49,067
than now.

886
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:54,072
In some places, within my own remembrance,the pines would scrape both sides of a

887
01:20:54,072 --> 01:21:00,002
chaise at once, and women and children whowere compelled to go this way to Lincoln

888
01:21:00,002 --> 01:21:08,026
alone and on foot did it with fear, andoften ran a good part of the distance.

889
01:21:08,026 --> 01:21:14,059
Though mainly but a humble route toneighboring villages, or for the woodman's

890
01:21:14,059 --> 01:21:19,072
team, it once amused the traveller morethan now by its variety, and lingered

891
01:21:19,072 --> 01:21:22,068
longer in his memory.

892
01:21:22,068 --> 01:21:29,049
Where now firm open fields stretch from thevillage to the woods, it then ran through a

893
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:35,399
maple swamp on a foundation of logs, theremnants of which, doubtless, still

894
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:38,609
underlie the present dusty highway, from

895
01:21:38,609 --> 01:21:43,083
the Stratton, now the Alms-House Farm, toBrister's Hill.

896
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:52,539
East of my bean-field, across the road,lived Cato Ingraham, slave of Duncan

897
01:21:52,539 --> 01:21:58,919
Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concordvillage, who built his slave a house, and

898
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:01,021
gave him permission to live in Walden

899
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:09,749
Woods;--Cato, not Uticensis, butConcordiensis.

900
01:22:09,749 --> 01:22:12,749
Some say that he was a Guinea Negro.

901
01:22:12,749 --> 01:22:18,013
There are a few who remember his littlepatch among the walnuts, which he let grow

902
01:22:18,013 --> 01:22:24,085
up till he should be old and need them; buta younger and whiter speculator got them at

903
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:26,058
last.

904
01:22:26,058 --> 01:22:33,019
He too, however, occupies an equally narrowhouse at present.

905
01:22:33,019 --> 01:22:39,039
Cato's half-obliterated cellar-hole stillremains, though known to few, being

906
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,063
concealed from the traveller by a fringe ofpines.

907
01:22:42,063 --> 01:22:49,005
It is now filled with the smooth sumach(Rhus glabra), and one of the earliest

908
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:57,199
species of goldenrod (Solidago stricta)grows there luxuriantly.

909
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:03,679
Here, by the very corner of my field, stillnearer to town, Zilpha, a colored woman,

910
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:10,058
had her little house, where she spun linenfor the townsfolk, making the Walden Woods

911
01:23:10,058 --> 01:23:18,529
ring with her shrill singing, for she had aloud and notable voice.

912
01:23:18,529 --> 01:23:24,469
At length, in the war of 1812, her dwellingwas set on fire by English soldiers,

913
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:31,969
prisoners on parole, when she was away, andher cat and dog and hens were all burned up

914
01:23:31,969 --> 01:23:34,169
together.

915
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:39,002
She led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane.

916
01:23:39,002 --> 01:23:43,021
One old frequenter of these woodsremembers, that as he passed her house one

917
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:50,093
noon he heard her muttering to herself overher gurgling pot--"Ye are all bones,

918
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:54,879
bones!"

919
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:59,939
I have seen bricks amid the oak copsethere.

920
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:06,099
Down the road, on the right hand, onBrister's Hill, lived Brister Freeman, "a

921
01:24:06,099 --> 01:24:13,018
handy Negro," slave of Squire Cummingsonce--there where grow still the apple

922
01:24:13,018 --> 01:24:16,499
trees which Brister planted and tended;

923
01:24:16,499 --> 01:24:22,599
large old trees now, but their fruit stillwild and ciderish to my taste.

924
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:30,809
Not long since I read his epitaph in theold Lincoln burying-ground, a little on one

925
01:24:30,809 --> 01:24:36,819
side, near the unmarked graves of someBritish grenadiers who fell in the retreat

926
01:24:36,819 --> 01:24:41,279
from Concord--where he is styled "Sippio

927
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:51,064
Brister"--Scipio Africanus he had sometitle to be called--"a man of color," as if

928
01:24:51,064 --> 01:24:55,969
he were discolored.

929
01:24:55,969 --> 01:25:02,008
It also told me, with staring emphasis,when he died; which was but an indirect way

930
01:25:02,008 --> 01:25:05,089
of informing me that he ever lived.

931
01:25:05,089 --> 01:25:13,092
With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife,who told fortunes, yet pleasantly--large,

932
01:25:13,092 --> 01:25:20,819
round, and black, blacker than any of thechildren of night, such a dusky orb as

933
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:25,839
never rose on Concord before or since.

934
01:25:25,839 --> 01:25:30,779
Farther down the hill, on the left, on theold road in the woods, are marks of some

935
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:35,789
homestead of the Stratton family; whoseorchard once covered all the slope of

936
01:25:35,789 --> 01:25:38,049
Brister's Hill, but was long since killed

937
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:45,076
out by pitch pines, excepting a few stumps,whose old roots furnish still the wild

938
01:25:45,076 --> 01:25:50,879
stocks of many a thrifty village tree.

939
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:56,061
Nearer yet to town, you come to Breed'slocation, on the other side of the way,

940
01:25:56,061 --> 01:26:02,039
just on the edge of the wood; ground famousfor the pranks of a demon not distinctly

941
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:05,067
named in old mythology, who has acted a

942
01:26:05,067 --> 01:26:11,119
prominent and astounding part in our NewEngland life, and deserves, as much as any

943
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:17,819
mythological character, to have hisbiography written one day; who first comes

944
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:21,039
in the guise of a friend or hired man, and

945
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:28,096
then robs and murders the whole family--New-England Rum.

946
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:35,379
But history must not yet tell the tragediesenacted here; let time intervene in some

947
01:26:35,379 --> 01:26:41,869
measure to assuage and lend an azure tintto them.

948
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:48,002
Here the most indistinct and dubioustradition says that once a tavern stood;

949
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:52,289
the well the same, which tempered thetraveller's beverage and refreshed his

950
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:53,909
steed.

951
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:59,749
Here then men saluted one another, andheard and told the news, and went their

952
01:26:59,749 --> 01:27:05,003
ways again.Breed's hut was standing only a dozen years

953
01:27:05,003 --> 01:27:09,629
ago, though it had long been unoccupied.

954
01:27:09,629 --> 01:27:15,929
It was about the size of mine.It was set on fire by mischievous boys, one

955
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:19,064
Election night, if I do not mistake.

956
01:27:19,064 --> 01:27:24,569
I lived on the edge of the village then,and had just lost myself over Davenant's

957
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:31,002
"Gondibert," that winter that I laboredwith a lethargy--which, by the way, I never

958
01:27:31,002 --> 01:27:33,036
knew whether to regard as a family

959
01:27:33,036 --> 01:27:39,077
complaint, having an uncle who goes tosleep shaving himself, and is obliged to

960
01:27:39,077 --> 01:27:46,058
sprout potatoes in a cellar Sundays, inorder to keep awake and keep the Sabbath,

961
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:48,096
or as the consequence of my attempt to read

962
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:53,095
Chalmers' collection of English poetrywithout skipping.

963
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:58,013
It fairly overcame my Nervii.

964
01:27:58,013 --> 01:28:04,007
I had just sunk my head on this when thebells rung fire, and in hot haste the

965
01:28:04,007 --> 01:28:09,029
engines rolled that way, led by astraggling troop of men and boys, and I

966
01:28:09,029 --> 01:28:14,003
among the foremost, for I had leaped thebrook.

967
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:20,048
We thought it was far south over the woods--we who had run to fires before--barn,

968
01:28:20,048 --> 01:28:24,007
shop, or dwelling-house, or all together.

969
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:30,097
"It's Baker's barn," cried one."It is the Codman place," affirmed another.

970
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:35,067
And then fresh sparks went up above thewood, as if the roof fell in, and we all

971
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:38,028
shouted "Concord to the rescue!"

972
01:28:38,028 --> 01:28:45,037
Wagons shot past with furious speed andcrushing loads, bearing, perchance, among

973
01:28:45,037 --> 01:28:53,062
the rest, the agent of the InsuranceCompany, who was bound to go however far;

974
01:28:53,062 --> 01:28:56,019
and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled

975
01:28:56,019 --> 01:29:02,023
behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost ofall, as it was afterward whispered, came

976
01:29:02,023 --> 01:29:07,024
they who set the fire and gave the alarm.

977
01:29:07,024 --> 01:29:13,092
Thus we kept on like true idealists,rejecting the evidence of our senses, until

978
01:29:13,092 --> 01:29:18,066
at a turn in the road we heard thecrackling and actually felt the heat of the

979
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:25,093
fire from over the wall, and realized,alas! that we were there.

980
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:29,073
The very nearness of the fire but cooledour ardor.

981
01:29:29,073 --> 01:29:35,093
At first we thought to throw a frog-pond onto it; but concluded to let it burn, it was

982
01:29:35,093 --> 01:29:39,073
so far gone and so worthless.

983
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:45,024
So we stood round our engine, jostled oneanother, expressed our sentiments through

984
01:29:45,024 --> 01:29:50,011
speaking-trumpets, or in lower tonereferred to the great conflagrations which

985
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:52,083
the world has witnessed, including Bascom's

986
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:57,092
shop, and, between ourselves, we thoughtthat, were we there in season with our

987
01:29:57,092 --> 01:30:05,053
"tub," and a full frog-pond by, we couldturn that threatened last and universal one

988
01:30:05,053 --> 01:30:08,055
into another flood.

989
01:30:08,055 --> 01:30:13,073
We finally retreated without doing anymischief--returned to sleep and

990
01:30:13,073 --> 01:30:15,046
"Gondibert."

991
01:30:15,046 --> 01:30:21,007
But as for "Gondibert," I would except thatpassage in the preface about wit being the

992
01:30:21,007 --> 01:30:29,078
soul's powder--"but most of mankind arestrangers to wit, as Indians are to

993
01:30:29,078 --> 01:30:31,095
powder."

994
01:30:31,095 --> 01:30:36,072
It chanced that I walked that way acrossthe fields the following night, about the

995
01:30:36,072 --> 01:30:41,076
same hour, and hearing a low moaning atthis spot, I drew near in the dark, and

996
01:30:41,076 --> 01:30:44,033
discovered the only survivor of the family

997
01:30:44,033 --> 01:30:51,032
that I know, the heir of both its virtuesand its vices, who alone was interested in

998
01:30:51,032 --> 01:30:57,009
this burning, lying on his stomach andlooking over the cellar wall at the still

999
01:30:57,009 --> 01:31:03,046
smouldering cinders beneath, muttering tohimself, as is his wont.

1000
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:09,026
He had been working far off in the rivermeadows all day, and had improved the first

1001
01:31:09,026 --> 01:31:15,047
moments that he could call his own to visitthe home of his fathers and his youth.

1002
01:31:15,047 --> 01:31:21,042
He gazed into the cellar from all sides andpoints of view by turns, always lying down

1003
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:26,073
to it, as if there was some treasure, whichhe remembered, concealed between the

1004
01:31:26,073 --> 01:31:33,076
stones, where there was absolutely nothingbut a heap of bricks and ashes.

1005
01:31:33,076 --> 01:31:37,092
The house being gone, he looked at whatthere was left.

1006
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:44,003
He was soothed by the sympathy which mymere presence implied, and showed me, as

1007
01:31:44,003 --> 01:31:49,016
well as the darkness permitted, where thewell was covered up; which, thank Heaven,

1008
01:31:49,016 --> 01:31:52,028
could never be burned; and he groped long

1009
01:31:52,028 --> 01:31:59,013
about the wall to find the well-sweep whichhis father had cut and mounted, feeling for

1010
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:05,003
the iron hook or staple by which a burdenhad been fastened to the heavy end--all

1011
01:32:05,003 --> 01:32:10,014
that he could now cling to--to convince methat it was no common "rider."

1012
01:32:10,014 --> 01:32:19,038
I felt it, and still remark it almost dailyin my walks, for by it hangs the history of

1013
01:32:19,038 --> 01:32:22,022
a family.

1014
01:32:22,022 --> 01:32:28,045
Once more, on the left, where are seen thewell and lilac bushes by the wall, in the

1015
01:32:28,045 --> 01:32:33,015
now open field, lived Nutting and LeGrosse.

1016
01:32:33,015 --> 01:32:37,067
But to return toward Lincoln.

1017
01:32:37,067 --> 01:32:42,012
Farther in the woods than any of these,where the road approaches nearest to the

1018
01:32:42,012 --> 01:32:48,066
pond, Wyman the potter squatted, andfurnished his townsmen with earthenware,

1019
01:32:48,066 --> 01:32:52,033
and left descendants to succeed him.

1020
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:57,029
Neither were they rich in worldly goods,holding the land by sufferance while they

1021
01:32:57,029 --> 01:33:04,087
lived; and there often the sheriff came invain to collect the taxes, and "attached a

1022
01:33:04,087 --> 01:33:08,042
chip," for form's sake, as I have read in

1023
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:14,009
his accounts, there being nothing else thathe could lay his hands on.

1024
01:33:14,009 --> 01:33:19,025
One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, aman who was carrying a load of pottery to

1025
01:33:19,025 --> 01:33:26,018
market stopped his horse against my fieldand inquired concerning Wyman the younger.

1026
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:30,044
He had long ago bought a potter's wheel ofhim, and wished to know what had become of

1027
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:32,066
him.

1028
01:33:32,066 --> 01:33:37,076
I had read of the potter's clay and wheelin Scripture, but it had never occurred to

1029
01:33:37,076 --> 01:33:44,022
me that the pots we use were not such ashad come down unbroken from those days, or

1030
01:33:44,022 --> 01:33:47,007
grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I

1031
01:33:47,007 --> 01:33:55,003
was pleased to hear that so fictile an artwas ever practiced in my neighborhood.

1032
01:33:55,003 --> 01:34:01,026
The last inhabitant of these woods beforeme was an Irishman, Hugh Quoil (if I have

1033
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:08,004
spelt his name with coil enough), whooccupied Wyman's tenement--Col.

1034
01:34:08,004 --> 01:34:10,087
Quoil, he was called.

1035
01:34:10,087 --> 01:34:15,047
Rumor said that he had been a soldier atWaterloo.

1036
01:34:15,047 --> 01:34:20,034
If he had lived I should have made himfight his battles over again.

1037
01:34:20,034 --> 01:34:22,046
His trade here was that of a ditcher.

1038
01:34:22,046 --> 01:34:30,025
Napoleon went to St. Helena; Quoil came toWalden Woods.

1039
01:34:30,025 --> 01:34:34,013
All I know of him is tragic.

1040
01:34:34,013 --> 01:34:39,038
He was a man of manners, like one who hadseen the world, and was capable of more

1041
01:34:39,038 --> 01:34:43,005
civil speech than you could well attend to.

1042
01:34:43,005 --> 01:34:48,036
He wore a greatcoat in midsummer, beingaffected with the trembling delirium, and

1043
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:52,072
his face was the color of carmine.

1044
01:34:52,072 --> 01:34:58,004
He died in the road at the foot ofBrister's Hill shortly after I came to the

1045
01:34:58,004 --> 01:35:03,066
woods, so that I have not remembered him asa neighbor.

1046
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:10,052
Before his house was pulled down, when hiscomrades avoided it as "an unlucky castle,"

1047
01:35:10,052 --> 01:35:13,004
I visited it.

1048
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:20,058
There lay his old clothes curled up by use,as if they were himself, upon his raised

1049
01:35:20,058 --> 01:35:25,096
plank bed.His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead

1050
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:29,089
of a bowl broken at the fountain.

1051
01:35:29,089 --> 01:35:35,086
The last could never have been the symbolof his death, for he confessed to me that,

1052
01:35:35,086 --> 01:35:43,016
though he had heard of Brister's Spring, hehad never seen it; and soiled cards, kings

1053
01:35:43,016 --> 01:35:50,001
of diamonds, spades, and hearts, werescattered over the floor.

1054
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:55,026
One black chicken which the administratorcould not catch, black as night and as

1055
01:35:55,026 --> 01:36:02,000
silent, not even croaking, awaitingReynard, still went to roost in the next

1056
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,056
apartment.

1057
01:36:04,056 --> 01:36:09,046
In the rear there was the dim outline of agarden, which had been planted but had

1058
01:36:09,046 --> 01:36:16,015
never received its first hoeing, owing tothose terrible shaking fits, though it was

1059
01:36:16,015 --> 01:36:18,075
now harvest time.

1060
01:36:18,075 --> 01:36:25,579
It was overrun with Roman wormwood andbeggar-ticks, which last stuck to my

1061
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:29,027
clothes for all fruit.

1062
01:36:29,027 --> 01:36:33,053
The skin of a woodchuck was freshlystretched upon the back of the house, a

1063
01:36:33,053 --> 01:36:43,989
trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warmcap or mittens would he want more.

1064
01:36:43,989 --> 01:36:49,032
Now only a dent in the earth marks the siteof these dwellings, with buried cellar

1065
01:36:49,032 --> 01:36:55,045
stones, and strawberries, raspberries,thimble-berries, hazel-bushes, and sumachs

1066
01:36:55,045 --> 01:36:59,014
growing in the sunny sward there; some

1067
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:05,057
pitch pine or gnarled oak occupies what wasthe chimney nook, and a sweet-scented black

1068
01:37:05,057 --> 01:37:12,028
birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stonewas.

1069
01:37:12,028 --> 01:37:20,022
Sometimes the well dent is visible, whereonce a spring oozed; now dry and tearless

1070
01:37:20,022 --> 01:37:28,058
grass; or it was covered deep--not to bediscovered till some late day--with a flat

1071
01:37:28,058 --> 01:37:34,087
stone under the sod, when the last of therace departed.

1072
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:43,029
What a sorrowful act must that be--thecovering up of wells! coincident with the

1073
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:47,084
opening of wells of tears.

1074
01:37:47,084 --> 01:37:57,003
These cellar dents, like deserted foxburrows, old holes, are all that is left

1075
01:37:57,003 --> 01:38:05,062
where once were the stir and bustle ofhuman life, and "fate, free will,

1076
01:38:05,062 --> 01:38:15,004
foreknowledge absolute," in some form anddialect or other were by turns discussed.

1077
01:38:15,004 --> 01:38:22,008
But all I can learn of their conclusionsamounts to just this, that "Cato and

1078
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:28,025
Brister pulled wool"; which is about asedifying as the history of more famous

1079
01:38:28,025 --> 01:38:31,039
schools of philosophy.

1080
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:37,006
Still grows the vivacious lilac ageneration after the door and lintel and

1081
01:38:37,006 --> 01:38:45,003
the sill are gone, unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring, to be plucked

1082
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:49,034
by the musing traveller; planted and tended

1083
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:57,004
once by children's hands, in front-yardplots--now standing by wallsides in retired

1084
01:38:57,004 --> 01:39:05,068
pastures, and giving place to new-risingforests;--the last of that stirp, sole

1085
01:39:05,068 --> 01:39:10,019
survivor of that family.

1086
01:39:10,019 --> 01:39:16,095
Little did the dusky children think thatthe puny slip with its two eyes only, which

1087
01:39:16,095 --> 01:39:23,003
they stuck in the ground in the shadow ofthe house and daily watered, would root

1088
01:39:23,003 --> 01:39:28,209
itself so, and outlive them, and house

1089
01:39:28,209 --> 01:39:36,062
itself in the rear that shaded it, andgrown man's garden and orchard, and tell

1090
01:39:36,062 --> 01:39:45,000
their story faintly to the lone wanderer ahalf-century after they had grown up and

1091
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:54,057
died--blossoming as fair, and smelling assweet, as in that first spring.

1092
01:39:54,057 --> 01:40:05,459
I mark its still tender, civil, cheerfullilac colors.

1093
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:14,011
But this small village, germ of somethingmore, why did it fail while Concord keeps

1094
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:18,088
its ground?Were there no natural advantages--no water

1095
01:40:18,088 --> 01:40:19,092
privileges, forsooth?

1096
01:40:19,092 --> 01:40:28,084
Ay, the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister'sSpring--privilege to drink long and healthy

1097
01:40:28,084 --> 01:40:37,059
draughts at these, all unimproved by thesemen but to dilute their glass.

1098
01:40:37,059 --> 01:40:42,058
They were universally a thirsty race.

1099
01:40:42,058 --> 01:40:49,032
Might not the basket, stable-broom, mat-making, corn-parching, linen-spinning, and

1100
01:40:49,032 --> 01:40:56,059
pottery business have thrived here, makingthe wilderness to blossom like the rose,

1101
01:40:56,059 --> 01:41:02,099
and a numerous posterity have inherited theland of their fathers?

1102
01:41:02,099 --> 01:41:11,057
The sterile soil would at least have beenproof against a low-land degeneracy.

1103
01:41:11,057 --> 01:41:17,073
Alas! how little does the memory of thesehuman inhabitants enhance the beauty of the

1104
01:41:17,073 --> 01:41:20,099
landscape!

1105
01:41:20,099 --> 01:41:30,028
Again, perhaps, Nature will try, with mefor a first settler, and my house raised

1106
01:41:30,028 --> 01:41:39,054
last spring to be the oldest in the hamlet.I am not aware that any man has ever built

1107
01:41:39,054 --> 01:41:43,052
on the spot which I occupy.

1108
01:41:43,052 --> 01:41:49,026
Deliver me from a city built on the site ofa more ancient city, whose materials are

1109
01:41:49,026 --> 01:41:53,959
ruins, whose gardens cemeteries.

1110
01:41:53,959 --> 01:42:01,459
The soil is blanched and accursed there,and before that becomes necessary the earth

1111
01:42:01,459 --> 01:42:09,014
itself will be destroyed.With such reminiscences I repeopled the

1112
01:42:09,014 --> 01:42:14,022
woods and lulled myself asleep.

1113
01:42:14,022 --> 01:42:17,024
At this season I seldom had a visitor.

1114
01:42:17,024 --> 01:42:22,085
When the snow lay deepest no wandererventured near my house for a week or

1115
01:42:22,085 --> 01:42:31,005
fortnight at a time, but there I lived assnug as a meadow mouse, or as cattle and

1116
01:42:31,005 --> 01:42:33,088
poultry which are said to have survived for

1117
01:42:33,088 --> 01:42:40,091
a long time buried in drifts, even withoutfood; or like that early settler's family

1118
01:42:40,091 --> 01:42:47,036
in the town of Sutton, in this State, whosecottage was completely covered by the great

1119
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:52,025
snow of 1717 when he was absent, and an

1120
01:42:52,025 --> 01:42:58,007
Indian found it only by the hole which thechimney's breath made in the drift, and so

1121
01:42:58,007 --> 01:43:01,059
relieved the family.

1122
01:43:01,059 --> 01:43:08,051
But no friendly Indian concerned himselfabout me; nor needed he, for the master of

1123
01:43:08,051 --> 01:43:15,026
the house was at home.The Great Snow!

1124
01:43:15,026 --> 01:43:18,092
How cheerful it is to hear of!

1125
01:43:18,092 --> 01:43:24,004
When the farmers could not get to the woodsand swamps with their teams, and were

1126
01:43:24,004 --> 01:43:29,045
obliged to cut down the shade trees beforetheir houses, and, when the crust was

1127
01:43:29,045 --> 01:43:32,065
harder, cut off the trees in the swamps,

1128
01:43:32,065 --> 01:43:37,054
ten feet from the ground, as it appearedthe next spring.

1129
01:43:37,054 --> 01:43:44,015
In the deepest snows, the path which I usedfrom the highway to my house, about half a

1130
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:51,098
mile long, might have been represented by ameandering dotted line, with wide intervals

1131
01:43:51,098 --> 01:43:54,066
between the dots.

1132
01:43:54,066 --> 01:43:59,082
For a week of even weather I took exactlythe same number of steps, and of the same

1133
01:43:59,082 --> 01:44:04,067
length, coming and going, steppingdeliberately and with the precision of a

1134
01:44:04,067 --> 01:44:10,043
pair of dividers in my own deep tracks--to

1135
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:16,076
such routine the winter reduces us--yetoften they were filled with heaven's own

1136
01:44:16,076 --> 01:44:19,055
blue.

1137
01:44:19,055 --> 01:44:25,039
But no weather interfered fatally with mywalks, or rather my going abroad, for I

1138
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:30,006
frequently tramped eight or ten milesthrough the deepest snow to keep an

1139
01:44:30,006 --> 01:44:33,073
appointment with a beech tree, or a yellow

1140
01:44:33,073 --> 01:44:41,079
birch, or an old acquaintance among thepines; when the ice and snow causing their

1141
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:49,067
limbs to droop, and so sharpening theirtops, had changed the pines into fir trees;

1142
01:44:49,067 --> 01:44:51,009
wading to the tops of the highest hills

1143
01:44:51,009 --> 01:44:58,062
when the show was nearly two feet deep on alevel, and shaking down another snow-storm

1144
01:44:58,062 --> 01:45:05,095
on my head at every step; or sometimescreeping and floundering thither on my

1145
01:45:05,095 --> 01:45:13,005
hands and knees, when the hunters had goneinto winter quarters.

1146
01:45:13,005 --> 01:45:22,019
One afternoon I amused myself by watching abarred owl (Strix nebulosa) sitting on one

1147
01:45:22,019 --> 01:45:29,027
of the lower dead limbs of a white pine,close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I

1148
01:45:29,027 --> 01:45:32,088
standing within a rod of him.

1149
01:45:32,088 --> 01:45:38,055
He could hear me when I moved and cronchedthe snow with my feet, but could not

1150
01:45:38,055 --> 01:45:40,099
plainly see me.

1151
01:45:40,099 --> 01:45:46,081
When I made most noise he would stretch outhis neck, and erect his neck feathers, and

1152
01:45:46,081 --> 01:45:56,004
open his eyes wide; but their lids soonfell again, and he began to nod.

1153
01:45:56,004 --> 01:46:02,038
I too felt a slumberous influence afterwatching him half an hour, as he sat thus

1154
01:46:02,038 --> 01:46:10,049
with his eyes half open, like a cat, wingedbrother of the cat.

1155
01:46:10,049 --> 01:46:17,048
There was only a narrow slit left betweentheir lids, by which he preserved a

1156
01:46:17,048 --> 01:46:24,048
peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from the land of

1157
01:46:24,048 --> 01:46:28,025
dreams, and endeavoring to realize me,

1158
01:46:28,025 --> 01:46:33,062
vague object or mote that interrupted hisvisions.

1159
01:46:33,062 --> 01:46:41,001
At length, on some louder noise or mynearer approach, he would grow uneasy and

1160
01:46:41,001 --> 01:46:48,579
sluggishly turn about on his perch, as ifimpatient at having his dreams disturbed;

1161
01:46:48,579 --> 01:46:51,007
and when he launched himself off and

1162
01:46:51,007 --> 01:46:58,002
flapped through the pines, spreading hiswings to unexpected breadth, I could not

1163
01:46:58,002 --> 01:47:01,047
hear the slightest sound from them.

1164
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:10,038
Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather bya delicate sense of their neighborhood than

1165
01:47:10,038 --> 01:47:18,092
by sight, feeling his twilight way, as itwere, with his sensitive pinions, he found

1166
01:47:18,092 --> 01:47:27,026
a new perch, where he might in peace awaitthe dawning of his day.

1167
01:47:27,026 --> 01:47:32,068
As I walked over the long causeway made forthe railroad through the meadows, I

1168
01:47:32,068 --> 01:47:39,053
encountered many a blustering and nippingwind, for nowhere has it freer play; and

1169
01:47:39,053 --> 01:47:43,004
when the frost had smitten me on one cheek,

1170
01:47:43,004 --> 01:47:48,027
heathen as I was, I turned to it the otheralso.

1171
01:47:48,027 --> 01:47:51,062
Nor was it much better by the carriage roadfrom Brister's Hill.

1172
01:47:51,062 --> 01:47:58,099
For I came to town still, like a friendlyIndian, when the contents of the broad open

1173
01:47:58,099 --> 01:48:04,054
fields were all piled up between the wallsof the Walden road, and half an hour

1174
01:48:04,054 --> 01:48:09,949
sufficed to obliterate the tracks of thelast traveller.

1175
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:16,003
And when I returned new drifts would haveformed, through which I floundered, where

1176
01:48:16,003 --> 01:48:22,035
the busy northwest wind had been depositingthe powdery snow round a sharp angle in the

1177
01:48:22,035 --> 01:48:26,005
road, and not a rabbit's track, nor even

1178
01:48:26,005 --> 01:48:33,024
the fine print, the small type, of a meadowmouse was to be seen.

1179
01:48:33,024 --> 01:48:40,579
Yet I rarely failed to find, even inmidwinter, some warm and springly swamp

1180
01:48:40,579 --> 01:48:47,074
where the grass and the skunk-cabbage stillput forth with perennial verdure, and some

1181
01:48:47,074 --> 01:48:56,004
hardier bird occasionally awaited thereturn of spring.

1182
01:48:56,004 --> 01:49:00,056
Sometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when Ireturned from my walk at evening I crossed

1183
01:49:00,056 --> 01:49:07,027
the deep tracks of a woodchopper leadingfrom my door, and found his pile of

1184
01:49:07,027 --> 01:49:14,001
whittlings on the hearth, and my housefilled with the odor of his pipe.

1185
01:49:14,001 --> 01:49:20,031
Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I chanced tobe at home, I heard the cronching of the

1186
01:49:20,031 --> 01:49:25,959
snow made by the step of a long-headedfarmer, who from far through the woods

1187
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:29,025
sought my house, to have a social "crack";

1188
01:49:29,025 --> 01:49:37,022
one of the few of his vocation who are "menon their farms"; who donned a frock instead

1189
01:49:37,022 --> 01:49:43,082
of a professor's gown, and is as ready toextract the moral out of church or state as

1190
01:49:43,082 --> 01:49:48,329
to haul a load of manure from his barn-yard.

1191
01:49:48,329 --> 01:49:55,026
We talked of rude and simple times, whenmen sat about large fires in cold, bracing

1192
01:49:55,026 --> 01:50:01,076
weather, with clear heads; and when otherdessert failed, we tried our teeth on many

1193
01:50:01,076 --> 01:50:05,015
a nut which wise squirrels have long since

1194
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:13,699
abandoned, for those which have thethickest shells are commonly empty.

1195
01:50:13,699 --> 01:50:19,009
The one who came from farthest to my lodge,through deepest snows and most dismal

1196
01:50:19,009 --> 01:50:24,004
tempests, was a poet.

1197
01:50:24,004 --> 01:50:33,062
A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a reporter,even a philosopher, may be daunted; but

1198
01:50:33,062 --> 01:50:40,829
nothing can deter a poet, for he isactuated by pure love.

1199
01:50:40,829 --> 01:50:44,011
Who can predict his comings and goings?

1200
01:50:44,011 --> 01:50:50,036
His business calls him out at all hours,even when doctors sleep.

1201
01:50:50,036 --> 01:50:55,005
We made that small house ring withboisterous mirth and resound with the

1202
01:50:55,005 --> 01:51:05,579
murmur of much sober talk, making amendsthen to Walden vale for the long silences.

1203
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:10,949
Broadway was still and deserted incomparison.

1204
01:51:10,949 --> 01:51:16,043
At suitable intervals there were regularsalutes of laughter, which might have been

1205
01:51:16,043 --> 01:51:23,075
referred indifferently to the last-utteredor the forth-coming jest.

1206
01:51:23,075 --> 01:51:29,059
We made many a "bran new" theory of lifeover a thin dish of gruel, which combined

1207
01:51:29,059 --> 01:51:37,029
the advantages of conviviality with theclear-headedness which philosophy requires.

1208
01:51:37,029 --> 01:51:42,002
I should not forget that during my lastwinter at the pond there was another

1209
01:51:42,002 --> 01:51:47,091
welcome visitor, who at one time camethrough the village, through snow and rain

1210
01:51:47,091 --> 01:51:50,088
and darkness, till he saw my lamp through

1211
01:51:50,088 --> 01:51:57,035
the trees, and shared with me some longwinter evenings.

1212
01:51:57,035 --> 01:52:04,016
One of the last of the philosophers--Connecticut gave him to the world--he

1213
01:52:04,016 --> 01:52:10,023
peddled first her wares, afterwards, as hedeclares, his brains.

1214
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:17,051
These he peddles still, prompting God anddisgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain

1215
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:24,034
only, like the nut its kernel.I think that he must be the man of the most

1216
01:52:24,034 --> 01:52:27,004
faith of any alive.

1217
01:52:27,004 --> 01:52:33,006
His words and attitude always suppose abetter state of things than other men are

1218
01:52:33,006 --> 01:52:41,003
acquainted with, and he will be the lastman to be disappointed as the ages revolve.

1219
01:52:41,003 --> 01:52:44,579
He has no venture in the present.

1220
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:50,097
But though comparatively disregarded now,when his day comes, laws unsuspected by

1221
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:58,449
most will take effect, and masters offamilies and rulers will come to him for

1222
01:52:58,449 --> 01:53:01,034
advice.

1223
01:53:01,034 --> 01:53:11,074
"How blind that cannot see serenity!"A true friend of man; almost the only

1224
01:53:11,074 --> 01:53:14,009
friend of human progress.

1225
01:53:14,009 --> 01:53:21,034
An Old Mortality, say rather anImmortality, with unwearied patience and

1226
01:53:21,034 --> 01:53:28,009
faith making plain the image engraven inmen's bodies, the God of whom they are but

1227
01:53:28,009 --> 01:53:33,035
defaced and leaning monuments.

1228
01:53:33,035 --> 01:53:41,139
With his hospitable intellect he embraceschildren, beggars, insane, and scholars,

1229
01:53:41,139 --> 01:53:50,289
and entertains the thought of all, addingto it commonly some breadth and elegance.

1230
01:53:50,289 --> 01:53:57,009
I think that he should keep a caravansaryon the world's highway, where philosophers

1231
01:53:57,009 --> 01:54:03,569
of all nations might put up, and on hissign should be printed, "Entertainment for

1232
01:54:03,569 --> 01:54:07,689
man, but not for his beast.

1233
01:54:07,689 --> 01:54:17,959
Enter ye that have leisure and a quietmind, who earnestly seek the right road."

1234
01:54:17,959 --> 01:54:25,699
He is perhaps the sanest man and has thefewest crotchets of any I chance to know;

1235
01:54:25,699 --> 01:54:29,087
the same yesterday and tomorrow.

1236
01:54:29,087 --> 01:54:37,379
Of yore we had sauntered and talked, andeffectually put the world behind us; for he

1237
01:54:37,379 --> 01:54:45,029
was pledged to no institution in it,freeborn, ingenuus.

1238
01:54:45,029 --> 01:54:51,031
Whichever way we turned, it seemed that theheavens and the earth had met together,

1239
01:54:51,031 --> 01:54:54,031
since he enhanced the beauty of thelandscape.

1240
01:54:54,031 --> 01:55:03,031
A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof is theoverarching sky which reflects his

1241
01:55:03,031 --> 01:55:10,419
serenity.I do not see how he can ever die; Nature

1242
01:55:10,419 --> 01:55:13,729
cannot spare him.

1243
01:55:13,729 --> 01:55:20,759
Having each some shingles of thought welldried, we sat and whittled them, trying our

1244
01:55:20,759 --> 01:55:26,035
knives, and admiring the clear yellowishgrain of the pumpkin pine.

1245
01:55:26,035 --> 01:55:33,699
We waded so gently and reverently, or wepulled together so smoothly, that the

1246
01:55:33,699 --> 01:55:41,699
fishes of thought were not scared from thestream, nor feared any angler on the bank,

1247
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:44,979
but came and went grandly, like the clouds

1248
01:55:44,979 --> 01:55:51,479
which float through the western sky, andthe mother-o'-pearl flocks which sometimes

1249
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:55,929
form and dissolve there.

1250
01:55:55,929 --> 01:56:03,649
There we worked, revising mythology,rounding a fable here and there, and

1251
01:56:03,649 --> 01:56:13,139
building castles in the air for which earthoffered no worthy foundation.

1252
01:56:13,139 --> 01:56:15,007
Great Looker!

1253
01:56:15,007 --> 01:56:23,439
Great Expecter! to converse with whom was aNew England Night's Entertainment.

1254
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:35,031
Ah! such discourse we had, hermit andphilosopher, and the old settler I have

1255
01:56:35,031 --> 01:56:44,019
spoken of--we three--it expanded and rackedmy little house; I should not dare to say

1256
01:56:44,019 --> 01:56:46,969
how many pounds' weight there was above the

1257
01:56:46,969 --> 01:56:54,036
atmospheric pressure on every circularinch; it opened its seams so that they had

1258
01:56:54,036 --> 01:57:01,649
to be calked with much dulness thereafterto stop the consequent leak;--but I had

1259
01:57:01,649 --> 01:57:07,519
enough of that kind of oakum alreadypicked.

1260
01:57:07,519 --> 01:57:15,449
There was one other with whom I had "solidseasons," long to be remembered, at his

1261
01:57:15,449 --> 01:57:21,429
house in the village, and who looked inupon me from time to time; but I had no

1262
01:57:21,429 --> 01:57:23,149
more for society there.

1263
01:57:23,149 --> 01:57:32,929
There too, as everywhere, I sometimesexpected the Visitor who never comes.

1264
01:57:32,929 --> 01:57:41,001
The Vishnu Purana says, "The house-holderis to remain at eventide in his courtyard

1265
01:57:41,001 --> 01:57:49,006
as long as it takes to milk a cow, orlonger if he pleases, to await the arrival

1266
01:57:49,006 --> 01:57:49,739
of a guest."

1267
01:57:49,739 --> 01:57:57,229
I often performed this duty of hospitality,waited long enough to milk a whole herd of

1268
01:57:57,229 --> 01:58:11,982
cows, but did not see the man approachingfrom the town.

1269
01:58:11,982 --> 01:58:12,982
>

1270
01:58:12,982 --> 01:58:23,282
CHAPTER 15Winter Animals

1271
01:58:23,282 --> 01:58:27,392
When the ponds were firmly frozen, theyafforded not only new and shorter routes to

1272
01:58:27,392 --> 01:58:32,401
many points, but new views from theirsurfaces of the familiar landscape around

1273
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:34,321
them.

1274
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:38,661
When I crossed Flint's Pond, after it wascovered with snow, though I had often

1275
01:58:38,661 --> 01:58:46,102
paddled about and skated over it, it was sounexpectedly wide and so strange that I

1276
01:58:46,102 --> 01:58:49,802
could think of nothing but Baffin's Bay.

1277
01:58:49,802 --> 01:58:55,052
The Lincoln hills rose up around me at theextremity of a snowy plain, in which I did

1278
01:58:55,052 --> 01:59:01,712
not remember to have stood before; and thefishermen, at an indeterminable distance

1279
01:59:01,712 --> 01:59:04,422
over the ice, moving slowly about with

1280
01:59:04,422 --> 01:59:12,122
their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers, orEsquimaux, or in misty weather loomed like

1281
01:59:12,122 --> 01:59:17,662
fabulous creatures, and I did not knowwhether they were giants or pygmies.

1282
01:59:17,662 --> 01:59:24,802
I took this course when I went to lecturein Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no

1283
01:59:24,802 --> 01:59:30,172
road and passing no house between my ownhut and the lecture room.

1284
01:59:30,172 --> 01:59:35,782
In Goose Pond, which lay in my way, acolony of muskrats dwelt, and raised their

1285
01:59:35,782 --> 01:59:42,022
cabins high above the ice, though nonecould be seen abroad when I crossed it.

1286
01:59:42,022 --> 01:59:47,412
Walden, being like the rest usually bare ofsnow, or with only shallow and interrupted

1287
01:59:47,412 --> 01:59:52,012
drifts on it, was my yard where I couldwalk freely when the snow was nearly two

1288
01:59:52,012 --> 01:59:59,472
feet deep on a level elsewhere and thevillagers were confined to their streets.

1289
01:59:59,472 --> 02:00:03,842
There, far from the village street, andexcept at very long intervals, from the

1290
02:00:03,842 --> 02:00:11,202
jingle of sleigh-bells, I slid and skated,as in a vast moose-yard well trodden,

1291
02:00:11,202 --> 02:00:19,612
overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bentdown with snow or bristling with icicles.

1292
02:00:19,612 --> 02:00:25,842
For sounds in winter nights, and often inwinter days, I heard the forlorn but

1293
02:00:25,842 --> 02:00:31,952
melodious note of a hooting owlindefinitely far; such a sound as the

1294
02:00:31,952 --> 02:00:34,242
frozen earth would yield if struck with a

1295
02:00:34,242 --> 02:00:42,092
suitable plectrum, the very linguavernacula of Walden Wood, and quite

1296
02:00:42,092 --> 02:00:47,922
familiar to me at last, though I never sawthe bird while it was making it.

1297
02:00:47,922 --> 02:00:57,032
I seldom opened my door in a winter eveningwithout hearing it; Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer,

1298
02:00:57,032 --> 02:01:05,522
hoo, sounded sonorously, and the firstthree syllables accented somewhat like how

1299
02:01:05,522 --> 02:01:12,922
der do; or sometimes hoo, hoo only.

1300
02:01:12,922 --> 02:01:18,542
One night in the beginning of winter,before the pond froze over, about nine

1301
02:01:18,542 --> 02:01:24,782
o'clock, I was startled by the loud honkingof a goose, and, stepping to the door,

1302
02:01:24,782 --> 02:01:26,732
heard the sound of their wings like a

1303
02:01:26,732 --> 02:01:31,502
tempest in the woods as they flew low overmy house.

1304
02:01:31,502 --> 02:01:36,882
They passed over the pond toward FairHaven, seemingly deterred from settling by

1305
02:01:36,882 --> 02:01:43,932
my light, their commodore honking all thewhile with a regular beat.

1306
02:01:43,932 --> 02:01:50,762
Suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from verynear me, with the most harsh and tremendous

1307
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:56,282
voice I ever heard from any inhabitant ofthe woods, responded at regular intervals

1308
02:01:56,282 --> 02:01:59,502
to the goose, as if determined to expose

1309
02:01:59,502 --> 02:02:05,952
and disgrace this intruder from Hudson'sBay by exhibiting a greater compass and

1310
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:14,392
volume of voice in a native, and boo-hoohim out of Concord horizon.

1311
02:02:14,392 --> 02:02:20,471
What do you mean by alarming the citadel atthis time of night consecrated to me?

1312
02:02:20,471 --> 02:02:26,691
Do you think I am ever caught napping atsuch an hour, and that I have not got lungs

1313
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:29,352
and a larynx as well as yourself?

1314
02:02:29,352 --> 02:02:35,891
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!It was one of the most thrilling discords I

1315
02:02:35,891 --> 02:02:38,211
ever heard.

1316
02:02:38,211 --> 02:02:44,162
And yet, if you had a discriminating ear,there were in it the elements of a concord

1317
02:02:44,162 --> 02:02:49,132
such as these plains never saw nor heard.

1318
02:02:49,132 --> 02:02:54,972
I also heard the whooping of the ice in thepond, my great bed-fellow in that part of

1319
02:02:54,972 --> 02:03:01,121
Concord, as if it were restless in its bedand would fain turn over, were troubled

1320
02:03:01,121 --> 02:03:05,481
with flatulency and had dreams; or I was

1321
02:03:05,481 --> 02:03:11,641
waked by the cracking of the ground by thefrost, as if some one had driven a team

1322
02:03:11,641 --> 02:03:17,431
against my door, and in the morning wouldfind a crack in the earth a quarter of a

1323
02:03:17,431 --> 02:03:21,942
mile long and a third of an inch wide.

1324
02:03:21,942 --> 02:03:28,371
Sometimes I heard the foxes as they rangedover the snow-crust, in moonlight nights,

1325
02:03:28,371 --> 02:03:33,942
in search of a partridge or other game,barking raggedly and demoniacally like

1326
02:03:33,942 --> 02:03:37,032
forest dogs, as if laboring with some

1327
02:03:37,032 --> 02:03:45,111
anxiety, or seeking expression, strugglingfor light and to be dogs outright and run

1328
02:03:45,111 --> 02:03:51,481
freely in the streets; for if we take theages into our account, may there not be a

1329
02:03:51,481 --> 02:03:57,211
civilization going on among brutes as wellas men?

1330
02:03:57,211 --> 02:04:02,951
They seemed to me to be rudimental,burrowing men, still standing on their

1331
02:04:02,951 --> 02:04:08,431
defence, awaiting their transformation.

1332
02:04:08,431 --> 02:04:13,961
Sometimes one came near to my window,attracted by my light, barked a vulpine

1333
02:04:13,961 --> 02:04:18,222
curse at me, and then retreated.

1334
02:04:18,222 --> 02:04:26,701
Usually the red squirrel (SciurusHudsonius) waked me in the dawn, coursing

1335
02:04:26,701 --> 02:04:31,391
over the roof and up and down the sides ofthe house, as if sent out of the woods for

1336
02:04:31,391 --> 02:04:33,861
this purpose.

1337
02:04:33,861 --> 02:04:37,972
In the course of the winter I threw outhalf a bushel of ears of sweet corn, which

1338
02:04:37,972 --> 02:04:43,511
had not got ripe, on to the snow-crust bymy door, and was amused by watching the

1339
02:04:43,511 --> 02:04:48,021
motions of the various animals which werebaited by it.

1340
02:04:48,021 --> 02:04:54,181
In the twilight and the night the rabbitscame regularly and made a hearty meal.

1341
02:04:54,181 --> 02:04:58,701
All day long the red squirrels came andwent, and afforded me much entertainment by

1342
02:04:58,701 --> 02:05:00,942
their manoeuvres.

1343
02:05:00,942 --> 02:05:05,961
One would approach at first warily throughthe shrub oaks, running over the snow-crust

1344
02:05:05,961 --> 02:05:12,511
by fits and starts like a leaf blown by thewind, now a few paces this way, with

1345
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:15,321
wonderful speed and waste of energy, making

1346
02:05:15,321 --> 02:05:23,002
inconceivable haste with his "trotters," asif it were for a wager, and now as many

1347
02:05:23,002 --> 02:05:29,151
paces that way, but never getting on morethan half a rod at a time; and then

1348
02:05:29,151 --> 02:05:30,631
suddenly pausing with a ludicrous

1349
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:37,371
expression and a gratuitous somerset, as ifall the eyes in the universe were eyed on

1350
02:05:37,371 --> 02:05:43,662
him--for all the motions of a squirrel,even in the most solitary recesses of the

1351
02:05:43,662 --> 02:05:47,942
forest, imply spectators as much as those

1352
02:05:47,942 --> 02:05:53,592
of a dancing girl--wasting more time indelay and circumspection than would have

1353
02:05:53,592 --> 02:06:00,442
sufficed to walk the whole distance--Inever saw one walk--and then suddenly,

1354
02:06:00,442 --> 02:06:02,911
before you could say Jack Robinson, he

1355
02:06:02,911 --> 02:06:07,981
would be in the top of a young pitch pine,winding up his clock and chiding all

1356
02:06:07,981 --> 02:06:14,641
imaginary spectators, soliloquizing andtalking to all the universe at the same

1357
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:17,181
time--for no reason that I could ever

1358
02:06:17,181 --> 02:06:22,741
detect, or he himself was aware of, Isuspect.

1359
02:06:22,741 --> 02:06:27,451
At length he would reach the corn, andselecting a suitable ear, frisk about in

1360
02:06:27,451 --> 02:06:33,651
the same uncertain trigonometrical way tothe topmost stick of my wood-pile, before

1361
02:06:33,651 --> 02:06:36,771
my window, where he looked me in the face,

1362
02:06:36,771 --> 02:06:43,631
and there sit for hours, supplying himselfwith a new ear from time to time, nibbling

1363
02:06:43,631 --> 02:06:49,741
at first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at length he grew

1364
02:06:49,741 --> 02:06:53,431
more dainty still and played with his food,

1365
02:06:53,431 --> 02:06:59,571
tasting only the inside of the kernel, andthe ear, which was held balanced over the

1366
02:06:59,571 --> 02:07:06,352
stick by one paw, slipped from his carelessgrasp and fell to the ground, when he would

1367
02:07:06,352 --> 02:07:08,732
look over at it with a ludicrous expression

1368
02:07:08,732 --> 02:07:15,152
of uncertainty, as if suspecting that ithad life, with a mind not made up whether

1369
02:07:15,152 --> 02:07:23,362
to get it again, or a new one, or be off;now thinking of corn, then listening to

1370
02:07:23,362 --> 02:07:26,612
hear what was in the wind.

1371
02:07:26,612 --> 02:07:33,121
So the little impudent fellow would wastemany an ear in a forenoon; till at last,

1372
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:38,522
seizing some longer and plumper one,considerably bigger than himself, and

1373
02:07:38,522 --> 02:07:41,491
skilfully balancing it, he would set out

1374
02:07:41,491 --> 02:07:47,751
with it to the woods, like a tiger with abuffalo, by the same zig-zag course and

1375
02:07:47,751 --> 02:07:53,542
frequent pauses, scratching along with itas if it were too heavy for him and falling

1376
02:07:53,542 --> 02:07:56,712
all the while, making its fall a diagonal

1377
02:07:56,712 --> 02:08:02,152
between a perpendicular and horizontal,being determined to put it through at any

1378
02:08:02,152 --> 02:08:10,991
rate;--a singularly frivolous and whimsicalfellow;--and so he would get off with it to

1379
02:08:10,991 --> 02:08:13,342
where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top

1380
02:08:13,342 --> 02:08:18,892
of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant,and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn

1381
02:08:18,892 --> 02:08:23,292
about the woods in various directions.

1382
02:08:23,292 --> 02:08:29,792
At length the jays arrive, whose discordantscreams were heard long before, as they

1383
02:08:29,792 --> 02:08:35,162
were warily making their approach an eighthof a mile off, and in a stealthy and

1384
02:08:35,162 --> 02:08:37,772
sneaking manner they flit from tree to

1385
02:08:37,772 --> 02:08:45,441
tree, nearer and nearer, and pick up thekernels which the squirrels have dropped.

1386
02:08:45,441 --> 02:08:51,071
Then, sitting on a pitch pine bough, theyattempt to swallow in their haste a kernel

1387
02:08:51,071 --> 02:08:56,092
which is too big for their throats andchokes them; and after great labor they

1388
02:08:56,092 --> 02:08:59,051
disgorge it, and spend an hour in the

1389
02:08:59,051 --> 02:09:03,551
endeavor to crack it by repeated blows withtheir bills.

1390
02:09:03,551 --> 02:09:10,472
They were manifestly thieves, and I had notmuch respect for them; but the squirrels,

1391
02:09:10,472 --> 02:09:17,732
though at first shy, went to work as ifthey were taking what was their own.

1392
02:09:17,732 --> 02:09:23,131
Meanwhile also came the chickadees inflocks, which, picking up the crumbs the

1393
02:09:23,131 --> 02:09:28,962
squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearesttwig and, placing them under their claws,

1394
02:09:28,962 --> 02:09:30,801
hammered away at them with their little

1395
02:09:30,801 --> 02:09:36,501
bills, as if it were an insect in the bark,till they were sufficiently reduced for

1396
02:09:36,501 --> 02:09:39,482
their slender throats.

1397
02:09:39,482 --> 02:09:45,922
A little flock of these titmice came dailyto pick a dinner out of my woodpile, or the

1398
02:09:45,922 --> 02:09:52,361
crumbs at my door, with faint flittinglisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles

1399
02:09:52,361 --> 02:09:56,022
in the grass, or else with sprightly day

1400
02:09:56,022 --> 02:10:05,222
day day, or more rarely, in spring-likedays, a wiry summery phe-be from the

1401
02:10:05,222 --> 02:10:07,842
woodside.

1402
02:10:07,842 --> 02:10:13,061
They were so familiar that at length onealighted on an armful of wood which I was

1403
02:10:13,061 --> 02:10:17,212
carrying in, and pecked at the stickswithout fear.

1404
02:10:17,212 --> 02:10:22,032
I once had a sparrow alight upon myshoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in

1405
02:10:22,032 --> 02:10:28,761
a village garden, and I felt that I wasmore distinguished by that circumstance

1406
02:10:28,761 --> 02:10:35,121
than I should have been by any epaulet Icould have worn.

1407
02:10:35,121 --> 02:10:39,921
The squirrels also grew at last to be quitefamiliar, and occasionally stepped upon my

1408
02:10:39,921 --> 02:10:44,251
shoe, when that was the nearest way.

1409
02:10:44,251 --> 02:10:49,421
When the ground was not yet quite covered,and again near the end of winter, when the

1410
02:10:49,421 --> 02:10:55,371
snow was melted on my south hillside andabout my wood-pile, the partridges came out

1411
02:10:55,371 --> 02:11:00,392
of the woods morning and evening to feedthere.

1412
02:11:00,392 --> 02:11:06,431
Whichever side you walk in the woods thepartridge bursts away on whirring wings,

1413
02:11:06,431 --> 02:11:12,441
jarring the snow from the dry leaves andtwigs on high, which comes sifting down in

1414
02:11:12,441 --> 02:11:19,772
the sunbeams like golden dust, for thisbrave bird is not to be scared by winter.

1415
02:11:19,772 --> 02:11:28,732
It is frequently covered up by drifts, and,it is said, "sometimes plunges from on wing

1416
02:11:28,732 --> 02:11:32,842
into the soft snow, where it remainsconcealed for a day or two."

1417
02:11:32,842 --> 02:11:39,982
I used to start them in the open land also,where they had come out of the woods at

1418
02:11:39,982 --> 02:11:44,772
sunset to "bud" the wild apple trees.

1419
02:11:44,772 --> 02:11:49,642
They will come regularly every evening toparticular trees, where the cunning

1420
02:11:49,642 --> 02:11:56,051
sportsman lies in wait for them, and thedistant orchards next the woods suffer thus

1421
02:11:56,051 --> 02:11:58,441
not a little.

1422
02:11:58,441 --> 02:12:01,152
I am glad that the partridge gets fed, atany rate.

1423
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:09,381
It is Nature's own bird which lives on budsand diet drink.

1424
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:16,731
In dark winter mornings, or in short winterafternoons, I sometimes heard a pack of

1425
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:24,142
hounds threading all the woods withhounding cry and yelp, unable to resist the

1426
02:12:24,142 --> 02:12:28,061
instinct of the chase, and the note of the

1427
02:12:28,061 --> 02:12:33,171
hunting-horn at intervals, proving that manwas in the rear.

1428
02:12:33,171 --> 02:12:39,991
The woods ring again, and yet no fox burstsforth on to the open level of the pond, nor

1429
02:12:39,991 --> 02:12:44,501
following pack pursuing their Actaeon.

1430
02:12:44,501 --> 02:12:49,731
And perhaps at evening I see the huntersreturning with a single brush trailing from

1431
02:12:49,731 --> 02:12:55,082
their sleigh for a trophy, seeking theirinn.

1432
02:12:55,082 --> 02:12:59,202
They tell me that if the fox would remainin the bosom of the frozen earth he would

1433
02:12:59,202 --> 02:13:08,212
be safe, or if he would run in a straightline away no foxhound could overtake him;

1434
02:13:08,212 --> 02:13:10,671
but, having left his pursuers far behind,

1435
02:13:10,671 --> 02:13:15,861
he stops to rest and listen till they comeup, and when he runs he circles round to

1436
02:13:15,861 --> 02:13:20,821
his old haunts, where the hunters awaithim.

1437
02:13:20,821 --> 02:13:25,972
Sometimes, however, he will run upon a wallmany rods, and then leap off far to one

1438
02:13:25,972 --> 02:13:31,761
side, and he appears to know that waterwill not retain his scent.

1439
02:13:31,761 --> 02:13:37,181
A hunter told me that he once saw a foxpursued by hounds burst out on to Walden

1440
02:13:37,181 --> 02:13:42,962
when the ice was covered with shallowpuddles, run part way across, and then

1441
02:13:42,962 --> 02:13:45,931
return to the same shore.

1442
02:13:45,931 --> 02:13:51,441
Ere long the hounds arrived, but here theylost the scent.

1443
02:13:51,441 --> 02:13:56,342
Sometimes a pack hunting by themselveswould pass my door, and circle round my

1444
02:13:56,342 --> 02:14:01,541
house, and yelp and hound without regardingme, as if afflicted by a species of

1445
02:14:01,541 --> 02:14:05,532
madness, so that nothing could divert themfrom the pursuit.

1446
02:14:05,532 --> 02:14:12,912
Thus they circle until they fall upon therecent trail of a fox, for a wise hound

1447
02:14:12,912 --> 02:14:16,011
will forsake everything else for this.

1448
02:14:16,011 --> 02:14:21,761
One day a man came to my hut from Lexingtonto inquire after his hound that made a

1449
02:14:21,761 --> 02:14:26,082
large track, and had been hunting for aweek by himself.

1450
02:14:26,082 --> 02:14:30,801
But I fear that he was not the wiser forall I told him, for every time I attempted

1451
02:14:30,801 --> 02:14:36,671
to answer his questions he interrupted meby asking, "What do you do here?"

1452
02:14:36,671 --> 02:14:41,111
He had lost a dog, but found a man.

1453
02:14:41,111 --> 02:14:47,332
One old hunter who has a dry tongue, whoused to come to bathe in Walden once every

1454
02:14:47,332 --> 02:14:52,981
year when the water was warmest, and atsuch times looked in upon me, told me that

1455
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:55,001
many years ago he took his gun one

1456
02:14:55,001 --> 02:15:00,741
afternoon and went out for a cruise inWalden Wood; and as he walked the Wayland

1457
02:15:00,741 --> 02:15:06,912
road he heard the cry of houndsapproaching, and ere long a fox leaped the

1458
02:15:06,912 --> 02:15:10,171
wall into the road, and as quick as thought

1459
02:15:10,171 --> 02:15:17,852
leaped the other wall out of the road, andhis swift bullet had not touched him.

1460
02:15:17,852 --> 02:15:23,052
Some way behind came an old hound and herthree pups in full pursuit, hunting on

1461
02:15:23,052 --> 02:15:27,812
their own account, and disappeared again inthe woods.

1462
02:15:27,812 --> 02:15:32,782
Late in the afternoon, as he was resting inthe thick woods south of Walden, he heard

1463
02:15:32,782 --> 02:15:39,282
the voice of the hounds far over towardFair Haven still pursuing the fox; and on

1464
02:15:39,282 --> 02:15:42,572
they came, their hounding cry which made

1465
02:15:42,572 --> 02:15:49,332
all the woods ring sounding nearer andnearer, now from Well Meadow, now from the

1466
02:15:49,332 --> 02:15:51,532
Baker Farm.

1467
02:15:51,532 --> 02:15:58,102
For a long time he stood still and listenedto their music, so sweet to a hunter's ear,

1468
02:15:58,102 --> 02:16:04,102
when suddenly the fox appeared, threadingthe solemn aisles with an easy coursing

1469
02:16:04,102 --> 02:16:07,772
pace, whose sound was concealed by a

1470
02:16:07,772 --> 02:16:14,772
sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift andstill, keeping the round, leaving his

1471
02:16:14,772 --> 02:16:21,352
pursuers far behind; and, leaping upon arock amid the woods, he sat erect and

1472
02:16:21,352 --> 02:16:25,412
listening, with his back to the hunter.

1473
02:16:25,412 --> 02:16:31,592
For a moment compassion restrained thelatter's arm; but that was a short-lived

1474
02:16:31,592 --> 02:16:38,662
mood, and as quick as thought can followthought his piece was levelled, and whang!-

1475
02:16:38,662 --> 02:16:44,482
-the fox, rolling over the rock, lay deadon the ground.

1476
02:16:44,482 --> 02:16:48,322
The hunter still kept his place andlistened to the hounds.

1477
02:16:48,322 --> 02:16:54,662
Still on they came, and now the near woodsresounded through all their aisles with

1478
02:16:54,662 --> 02:16:57,892
their demoniac cry.

1479
02:16:57,892 --> 02:17:02,812
At length the old hound burst into viewwith muzzle to the ground, and snapping the

1480
02:17:02,812 --> 02:17:10,822
air as if possessed, and ran directly tothe rock; but, spying the dead fox, she

1481
02:17:10,822 --> 02:17:14,592
suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck

1482
02:17:14,592 --> 02:17:22,172
dumb with amazement, and walked round andround him in silence; and one by one her

1483
02:17:22,172 --> 02:17:29,252
pups arrived, and, like their mother, weresobered into silence by the mystery.

1484
02:17:29,252 --> 02:17:34,612
Then the hunter came forward and stood intheir midst, and the mystery was solved.

1485
02:17:34,612 --> 02:17:40,012
They waited in silence while he skinned thefox, then followed the brush a while, and

1486
02:17:40,012 --> 02:17:44,022
at length turned off into the woods again.

1487
02:17:44,022 --> 02:17:48,662
That evening a Weston squire came to theConcord hunter's cottage to inquire for his

1488
02:17:48,662 --> 02:17:53,532
hounds, and told how for a week they hadbeen hunting on their own account from

1489
02:17:53,532 --> 02:17:55,972
Weston woods.

1490
02:17:55,972 --> 02:18:00,942
The Concord hunter told him what he knewand offered him the skin; but the other

1491
02:18:00,942 --> 02:18:02,132
declined it and departed.

1492
02:18:02,132 --> 02:18:08,432
He did not find his hounds that night, butthe next day learned that they had crossed

1493
02:18:08,432 --> 02:18:13,592
the river and put up at a farmhouse for thenight, whence, having been well fed, they

1494
02:18:13,592 --> 02:18:17,062
took their departure early in the morning.

1495
02:18:17,062 --> 02:18:22,142
The hunter who told me this could rememberone Sam Nutting, who used to hunt bears on

1496
02:18:22,142 --> 02:18:28,882
Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skinsfor rum in Concord village; who told him,

1497
02:18:28,882 --> 02:18:31,452
even, that he had seen a moose there.

1498
02:18:31,452 --> 02:18:41,612
Nutting had a famous foxhound namedBurgoyne--he pronounced it Bugine--which my

1499
02:18:41,612 --> 02:18:44,362
informant used to borrow.

1500
02:18:44,362 --> 02:18:51,572
In the "Wast Book" of an old trader of thistown, who was also a captain, town-clerk,

1501
02:18:51,572 --> 02:18:55,272
and representative, I find the followingentry.

1502
02:18:55,272 --> 02:18:55,662
Jan.

1503
02:18:55,662 --> 02:19:10,112
18th, 1742-3, "John Melven Cr. by 1 GreyFox 0--2--3"; they are not now found here;

1504
02:19:10,112 --> 02:19:22,452
and in his ledger, Feb, 7th, 1743, HezekiahStratton has credit "by 1/2 a Catt skin 0--

1505
02:19:22,452 --> 02:19:29,742
1--4-1/2"; of course, a wild-cat, for

1506
02:19:29,742 --> 02:19:34,682
Stratton was a sergeant in the old Frenchwar, and would not have got credit for

1507
02:19:34,682 --> 02:19:40,932
hunting less noble game.Credit is given for deerskins also, and

1508
02:19:40,932 --> 02:19:44,062
they were daily sold.

1509
02:19:44,062 --> 02:19:48,912
One man still preserves the horns of thelast deer that was killed in this vicinity,

1510
02:19:48,912 --> 02:19:54,942
and another has told me the particulars ofthe hunt in which his uncle was engaged.

1511
02:19:54,942 --> 02:19:58,042
The hunters were formerly a numerous andmerry crew here.

1512
02:19:58,042 --> 02:20:05,142
I remember well one gaunt Nimrod who wouldcatch up a leaf by the roadside and play a

1513
02:20:05,142 --> 02:20:14,652
strain on it wilder and more melodious, ifmy memory serves me, than any hunting-horn.

1514
02:20:14,652 --> 02:20:20,072
At midnight, when there was a moon, Isometimes met with hounds in my path

1515
02:20:20,072 --> 02:20:27,132
prowling about the woods, which would skulkout of my way, as if afraid, and stand

1516
02:20:27,132 --> 02:20:31,382
silent amid the bushes till I had passed.

1517
02:20:31,382 --> 02:20:35,362
Squirrels and wild mice disputed for mystore of nuts.

1518
02:20:35,362 --> 02:20:41,592
There were scores of pitch pines around myhouse, from one to four inches in diameter,

1519
02:20:41,592 --> 02:20:46,392
which had been gnawed by mice the previouswinter--a Norwegian winter for them, for

1520
02:20:46,392 --> 02:20:48,912
the snow lay long and deep, and they were

1521
02:20:48,912 --> 02:20:54,582
obliged to mix a large proportion of pinebark with their other diet.

1522
02:20:54,582 --> 02:20:59,582
These trees were alive and apparentlyflourishing at midsummer, and many of them

1523
02:20:59,582 --> 02:21:05,532
had grown a foot, though completelygirdled; but after another winter such were

1524
02:21:05,532 --> 02:21:08,992
without exception dead.

1525
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:14,202
It is remarkable that a single mouse shouldthus be allowed a whole pine tree for its

1526
02:21:14,202 --> 02:21:20,452
dinner, gnawing round instead of up anddown it; but perhaps it is necessary in

1527
02:21:20,452 --> 02:21:25,582
order to thin these trees, which are wontto grow up densely.

1528
02:21:25,582 --> 02:21:30,762
The hares (Lepus Americanus) were veryfamiliar.

1529
02:21:30,762 --> 02:21:36,992
One had her form under my house all winter,separated from me only by the flooring, and

1530
02:21:36,992 --> 02:21:43,172
she startled me each morning by her hastydeparture when I began to stir--thump,

1531
02:21:43,172 --> 02:21:48,572
thump, thump, striking her head against thefloor timbers in her hurry.

1532
02:21:48,572 --> 02:21:52,922
They used to come round my door at dusk tonibble the potato parings which I had

1533
02:21:52,922 --> 02:21:57,372
thrown out, and were so nearly the color ofthe ground that they could hardly be

1534
02:21:57,372 --> 02:22:00,492
distinguished when still.

1535
02:22:00,492 --> 02:22:05,262
Sometimes in the twilight I alternatelylost and recovered sight of one sitting

1536
02:22:05,262 --> 02:22:09,892
motionless under my window.When I opened my door in the evening, off

1537
02:22:09,892 --> 02:22:13,982
they would go with a squeak and a bounce.

1538
02:22:13,982 --> 02:22:17,082
Near at hand they only excited my pity.

1539
02:22:17,082 --> 02:22:24,232
One evening one sat by my door two pacesfrom me, at first trembling with fear, yet

1540
02:22:24,232 --> 02:22:32,532
unwilling to move; a poor wee thing, leanand bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose,

1541
02:22:32,532 --> 02:22:36,822
scant tail and slender paws.

1542
02:22:36,822 --> 02:22:43,582
It looked as if Nature no longer containedthe breed of nobler bloods, but stood on

1543
02:22:43,582 --> 02:22:49,582
her last toes.Its large eyes appeared young and

1544
02:22:49,582 --> 02:22:52,012
unhealthy, almost dropsical.

1545
02:22:52,012 --> 02:23:00,052
I took a step, and lo, away it scud with anelastic spring over the snow-crust,

1546
02:23:00,052 --> 02:23:05,092
straightening its body and its limbs intograceful length, and soon put the forest

1547
02:23:05,092 --> 02:23:08,962
between me and itself--the wild free

1548
02:23:08,962 --> 02:23:16,332
venison, asserting its vigor and thedignity of Nature.

1549
02:23:16,332 --> 02:23:24,502
Not without reason was its slenderness.Such then was its nature.

1550
02:23:24,502 --> 02:23:33,012
(Lepus, levipes, light-foot, some think.)What is a country without rabbits and

1551
02:23:33,012 --> 02:23:34,602
partridges?

1552
02:23:34,602 --> 02:23:40,602
They are among the most simple andindigenous animal products; ancient and

1553
02:23:40,602 --> 02:23:47,672
venerable families known to antiquity as tomodern times; of the very hue and substance

1554
02:23:47,672 --> 02:23:51,892
of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to

1555
02:23:51,892 --> 02:23:59,602
the ground--and to one another; it iseither winged or it is legged.

1556
02:23:59,602 --> 02:24:04,002
It is hardly as if you had seen a wildcreature when a rabbit or a partridge

1557
02:24:04,002 --> 02:24:13,072
bursts away, only a natural one, as much tobe expected as rustling leaves.

1558
02:24:13,072 --> 02:24:18,892
The partridge and the rabbit are still sureto thrive, like true natives of the soil,

1559
02:24:18,892 --> 02:24:22,472
whatever revolutions occur.

1560
02:24:22,472 --> 02:24:28,082
If the forest is cut off, the sprouts andbushes which spring up afford them

1561
02:24:28,082 --> 02:24:32,662
concealment, and they become more numerousthan ever.

1562
02:24:32,662 --> 02:24:39,052
That must be a poor country indeed thatdoes not support a hare.

1563
02:24:39,052 --> 02:24:44,782
Our woods teem with them both, and aroundevery swamp may be seen the partridge or

1564
02:24:44,782 --> 02:24:52,122
rabbit walk, beset with twiggy fences andhorse-hair snares, which some cow-boy

1565
02:24:52,122 --> 02:24:56,982
tends.

1566
02:24:56,982 --> 99:59:59,999

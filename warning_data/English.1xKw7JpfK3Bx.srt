1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,700
What I have right in front
of me is the Khan Academy

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,930
measuring angles exercise.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,440
I have a small part of it in
this screen right over here.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,190
And it's a pretty cool
exercise because it

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,900
has this little
virtual protractor

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,910
that we can use to
actually measure angles.

7
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,699
And I want to give
credit to the person who

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,390
built this protractor, because
I think it's pretty neat.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,040
Omar Rizwan, who was actually
a high school intern,

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,760
made this pretty neat module.

11
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,972
And so in general, when you
want to measure an angle,

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,710
what you want to do
is you want to put

13
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,650
the center of your
protractor at the center of--

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,170
or I should say, at the
vertex of the angle.

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,170
Or you want to put the
vertex of the angle

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,030
at the center of the protractor.

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,230
And then what you want to do
is either rotate the angle

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,370
or rotate the protractor.

19
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,610
In this case, we're going
to rotate the protractor.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,140
You want to rotate
the protractor

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,570
so that the 0 angle,
or kind of the 0 mark,

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,850
is at one of the
sides of the angle.

23
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,590
And the other side of the
angle is within the protractor.

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,590
So let's try to do that.

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,240
So maybe if we want to
do that, this 0 side

26
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,200
should be at this
side of the angle.

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,120
So let's rotate it that way.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,840
Let me just keep rotating it.

29
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,167
If I could just keep it pressed.

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,560
That's better.

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
All right.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,210
That looks about right.

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,030
So one side is at the 0 mark.

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,540
And then my angle,
my other side--

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,630
or if this was a
ray, it points to,

36
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,120
looks like, pretty close
to the 20 degree mark.

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,060
So I will type that
in off the screen.

38
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,170
You don't see that.

39
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,780
And that is the right answer.

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,400
And then we can
get another angle.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,920
So let's try to measure
this one right over here.

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,980
So once again, place the
center of the protractor

43
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,620
at the center, at the
vertex, of our angle.

44
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,170
We can place the 0 degree,
the base of the protractor,

45
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,340
at this side of the angle.

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,920
So let's just rotate it a
little bit, maybe one more time.

47
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,270
That looks about right.

48
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,390
And then the angle is now
opening up-- let's see,

49
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,200
the other side is
pointing to 110 degrees.

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,690
So this is larger
than 90 degrees.

51
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,730
It's also an obtuse angle.

52
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,260
The last one was an acute angle.

53
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,530
This is obtuse, 110 degrees.

54
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,790
More than 90 degrees.

55
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,570
So let me type it in.

56
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,020
I got the right answer.

57
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,790
Let's do a couple more of these.

58
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,270
So once again, put the
center of the protractor

59
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:17,545
at the vertex of our angle.

60
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,480
And now, I want to rotate it.

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,130
There we go.

62
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,570
And this looks like roughly
an 80 degree angle, not quite.

63
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,200
If I have to be
really precise, it

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,310
looks like it's maybe
81 or 82 degrees.

65
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,310
But I'll just go with
80 as my best guess.

66
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:36,272
I got the right answer.

67
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,640
Let's do one more of these.

68
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,100
So once again,
vertex of my angle

69
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,050
at the center of my protractor.

70
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,480
And then I want to put one side
of the angle at the 0 degree.

71
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,654
And I want to show you,
there's two ways to do that.

72
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,310
You could do this.

73
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,710
You could do just this.

74
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,180
But this isn't too helpful,
because the angle is now

75
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,120
outside.

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,300
The other side sits
outside of the protractor.

77
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,350
So you want the 0
degrees on the side,

78
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,270
so the other side is
within the protractor.

79
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,990
So let's keep rotating it.

80
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,020
There we go.

81
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,480
And then our other
side opens up or you

82
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,620
could say points to 70 degrees.

83
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,540
So this is an acute
angle right over here.

84
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,430
So it is 70 degrees.

85
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,970
So I'll leave you with that.

86
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,370
Oh look, I'm ready to move
on, the exercise tells me.

87
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,130
And now we can start talking
about more things about angles

88
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,650
now that we know
how to measure them.

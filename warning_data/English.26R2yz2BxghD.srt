1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,410
The main mast of a fishing boat
is supported by a sturdy

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,720
rope that extends from the top
of the mast to the deck.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,990
If the mast is 20 feet tall and
the rope attaches to the

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,390
deck 15 feet away from
the base of the mast,

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,110
how long is the rope?

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,260
So let's draw ourselves a boat
and make sure we understand

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,150
what the deck and the mast
and all of that is.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,620
So let me draw a boat.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,200
I'll start with yellow.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,270
So let's say that
this is my boat.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,740
That is the deck of the boat.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,100
And the boat might look
something like this.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,480
It's a sailing boat.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,210
This is the water down here.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,875
And then the mast is the thing
that holds up the sail.

16
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:56,630
So let me draw ourselves
a mast.

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,550
And they say the mast
is 20 feet tall.

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,769
So this distance right
here is 20 feet.

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,100
That is what is holding
up the sail.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,230
I can draw it as a pole so it's
a little bit clearer.

21
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,960
Even shade it in if we like.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,200
And then they say a rope
attaches to the deck 15 feet

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,670
away from the base of the mast.
So this is the base of

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,960
the mast. This is the
deck right here.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,190
The rope attaches 15 feet away
from the base of the mast.

26
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,590
So if this is the base of the
mast, we go 15 feet, might be

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,255
about that distance
right there.

28
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,505
Let me mark that.

29
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:36,330
Distance right there is 15 feet.

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,620
And the rope attaches
right here,

31
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,340
from the top of the mast
all the way that base.

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,290
So the rope goes like that.

33
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,330
And then they ask us, how
long is the rope?

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,470
So there's a few things
you might realize.

35
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,550
We're dealing with
a triangle here.

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,750
And it's not any triangle.

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,680
We're assuming that the mast
goes straight up and that the

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,370
deck is straight
left and right.

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,970
So this is a right triangle.

40
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,090
This is a 90 degree
angle right here.

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,660
And we know that, if we know two
sides of a right triangle,

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,600
we can always figure out the
third side of a right triangle

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,850
using the Pythagorean theorem.

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,220
And all that tells us is it the
sum of the squares of the

45
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,610
shorter sides of the triangle
are going to be equal to the

46
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,280
square of the longer side.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,540
And that longer side is
call the hypotenuse.

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,010
And in all cases, the hypotenuse
is the side

49
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,360
opposite the 90 degree angle.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,720
It is always going to
be the longest side

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,760
of our right triangle.

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,580
So we need to figure out
the hypotenuse here.

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,920
We know the lengths of the
two shorter sides.

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,210
So we can see that if we take 15
squared, that's one of the

55
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,280
short sides, I'm squaring it.

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,050
And then add that to the square
of the other shorter

57
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,125
side, to 20 feet squared.

58
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,620
And when I say the shorter side,
I mean relative to the

59
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,260
hypotenuse.

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,700
The hypotenuse will always
be the longest side.

61
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,670
Let's say the hypotenuse is in
green just so we get our color

62
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,940
coding nice.

63
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,260
That is going to be equal
to the rope squared.

64
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,520
Or the length of the rope.

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,070
Let's call this distance
right here r.

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,320
r for rope.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,440
So 15 squared plus 20
squared is going to

68
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,080
be equal to r squared.

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,510
And what's 15 squared?

70
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,260
It's 225.

71
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,840
20 squared is 400.

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,460
And that's going to be
equal to r squared.

73
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,260
Now 225 plus 400 is 625.

74
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,430
625 is equal to r squared.

75
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,443
And then we can take the
principal root of both sides

76
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:58,430
of this equation.

77
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,370
Because we're talking about
distances, we want the

78
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,800
positive square root.

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,460
So you take the positive square
root, or the principal

80
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,140
root, of both sides
of this equation.

81
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,050
And you are left with
r is equal to the

82
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,540
square root of 625.

83
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,960
You can play with it a little
bit if you like.

84
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,500
But if you've ever played with
numbers around 25, you'll see

85
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,740
that this is 25 squared.

86
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,520
So r is equal to the square
root of 625, which is 25.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
So this distance right here,
the length of the rope, is

88
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,700
equal to 25 feet.

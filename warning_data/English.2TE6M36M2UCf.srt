1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660


2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,300
Determine the number of
solutions to the quadratic

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,200
equation, x squared plus 14x
plus 49 is equal to 0.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,760
There's a bunch of ways
we could do it.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,325
We could factor it and just
figure out the values of x

6
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:13,560
that satisfy it and
just count them.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,310
That will be the number
of solutions.

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,400
We could just apply the
quadratic formula.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,690
But what I want to do here is
actually explore the quadratic

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,290
formula, and think about how we
can determine the number of

11
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,290
solutions without even maybe
necessarily finding them

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,280
explicitly.

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,950
So the quadratic formula tells
us that if we have an equation

14
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,830
of the form ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0, that the

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,840
solutions are going to be-- or
the solution if it exists is

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,860
going to be-- negative b plus or
minus the square root of b

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,570
squared minus 4ac.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,770
All of that over 2a.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,220
Now the reason why this can be
2 solutions is that we have a

20
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,070
plus or minus here.

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,620
If this b squared minus 4ac is
a positive number-- so let's

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,250
think about this a little bit.

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,220
If b squared minus 4ac
is greater than 0,

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,470
what's going to happen?

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,410
Well, then it's a
positive number.

26
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,950
It's going to have
a square root.

27
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,920
And then when you add it to
negative b you're going to get

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,910
one value for the numerator, and
when you subtract it from

29
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,400
negative b you are going
to get another

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,450
value in the numerator.

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,935
So this is going to lead
to two solutions.

32
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:24,250


33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,550
Now what happens if b squared
minus 4ac is equal to 0?

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,390
If this expression under the
radical is equal to 0, you're

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,860
just going to have the
square root of 0.

36
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,790
So it's going to be negative
b plus or minus 0.

37
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,673
And it doesn't matter whether
you add or subtract 0, you're

38
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:42,270
going to get the same value.

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,870
So in that situation, the
actual solution of the

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,260
equation is going to be
negative b over 2a.

41
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,060
There's not going to be this
plus or minus, it's not going

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,540
to be relevant.

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,770
You're only going to
have one solution.

44
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,170
So if b squared minus 4ac
is equal to 0, you

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,920
only have one solution.

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,240
And then what happens if
b squared minus 4ac

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,150
is less than 0?

48
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,800
Well if b squared minus 4ac is
less than 0, this is going to

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,863
be a negative number right here
and you're going to have

50
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,880
to take the square root
of a negative number.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,430
And we know, from dealing with
real numbers, you can't take

52
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,020
the square root.

53
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,010
There is no real number
squared that becomes a

54
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,560
negative number.

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,560
So in this situation there is
no solutions, or no real--

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,370
when I say real I literally
mean a real

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,195
number-- no real solution.

58
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,460


59
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,530
So let's think about it
in the context of this

60
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,670
equation right here.

61
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,840
And just in case you're curious
if whether this

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,170
expression right here,
b squared minus 4ac,

63
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,740
has a name, it does.

64
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,990
It's called the discriminant.

65
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,190


66
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,045
This is the discriminant.

67
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,032
That's that part of the
quadratic equation.

68
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:55,450
It determines the number
of solutions we have.

69
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,185
So if we want to figure out the
number of solutions for

70
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,180
this equation, we don't have
to go through the whole

71
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,360
quadratic equation, although
it's not that much work.

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,400
We just have to evaluate
b squared minus 4ac.

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,530
So what is b squared
minus 4ac?

74
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,830
So b is right here, it's 14.

75
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:19,590
So it's 14 squared minus 4 times
a, which is 1, times c,

76
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,120
which is 49.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,480
That c, right there, times 49.

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,972
What's 14 times 14?

79
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,275
Let me do it over here.

80
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:31,480


81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,870
14 times 14.

82
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,230
4 times 4 is 16.

83
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,120
4 times 1 is 4.

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,540
Plus 1 is 56.

85
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,180
Put a 0.

86
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,100
1 times 14 is 14.

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,850
It is 6, 9, 1.

88
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,800
It's 196.

89
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,750
So this right here is 196.

90
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,070
And we can ignore the 1.

91
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,845
What's 4 times 49?

92
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:56,080
So 49 times 4.

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
4 times 9 is 36.

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,090
4 times 4 is 16 plus
3 is 190-- or is

95
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,210
19, so you get 196.

96
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,200
So this right here is 196.

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,540
So b squared minus 4ac
is 196 minus 196.

98
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,250
So 196 minus 196
is equal to 0.

99
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,850
So we're dealing with a
situation where the

100
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,720
discriminant is equal to 0.

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,120
We only have one solution.

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,800
And if you want, you could try
to find that one solution.

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,020
This whole part is going to
be the square root of 0.

104
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
It's just going to be 0.

105
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,790
So the solution is going to
be negative b over 2a.

106
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,920
And negative b is-- we
could just solve it.

107
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,170
Negative b is negative 14 over 2
times a. a is just 1 over 2.

108
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,420
So it's equal to negative 7.

109
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,560
That's the only solution
to this equation.

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,480
But if you just wanted to know
how many solutions, you just

111
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,460
have to find out that b squared
minus 4ac is 0.

112
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,250
So it's only going to
have one solution.

113
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,990
And there's other ways.

114
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,530
You could have actually factored
this pretty easily

115
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,270
into x plus 7 times x plus 7
and gotten the same result.

116
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,666

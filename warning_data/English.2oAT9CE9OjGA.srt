1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630


2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,510
Paulo wants to earn $1500
by mowing lawns.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,980
He will charge $35 for
each lawn he mows.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,860
What is the minimum number of
lawns the Paulo needs to mow

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,790
to reach his goal of $1500?

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,770
So we need to figure out the
minimum number of lawns that

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,700
Paulo needs to mow.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,470
Now, whatever that number is,
that number times $35, because

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,580
that's how much he's going
to get per lawn.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,470
So the number that he has to
mow times $35 needs to be

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,450
greater than 1,500.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,640
So to figure out that number,
let's just divide 1,500

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,820
divided by 35.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,460
Maybe it goes evenly, and
that'll be the number of lawn

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,740
he needs to mow.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:57,210
So we're going to take 1,500
and divide it by 35 because

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,070
that's how much he gets
paid per lawn.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,530


19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,060
Now 35 does not go into 1, so we
have to add another digit.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,570
35 does not go into 15.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,570
35 goes into 150.

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,170
Well, 30 goes into
150 five times.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,700
35 is bigger so it won't
go into it five times.

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,620
Let's try out 4.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,620
Let's see if it goes
into it four times.

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,630
4 times 5 is 20.

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,880
Let's regroup the 2,
or carry the 2.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,900
Four times 3 is 12.

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,580
12 plus 2 is 14.

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,480
Now we subtract.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,930
0 minus 0 is 0.

32
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,160
5 minus 4 is 1.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,500
The ones cancel out, and
then we bring down

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,940
this zero right here.

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,440
35 goes into 100.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,140
Well, 35 times 2 is 70, and if
you add another-- 35 times 3

37
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,440
is 105, so that's too big, so
it goes into it two times.

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,850
2 times 5 is 10.

39
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,250
Let's carry the 1.

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,680
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is
7, or 35 times 2 is 70.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,190
You subtract.

42
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,370
0 minus 0 is 0.

43
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,960
0 minus 7, you can't do it.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,360
You could already view it as 10
minus 7, or if you want to

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,580
go in the traditional way, this
0 can take or borrow 1

46
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,810
from this 1, so that
becomes a 0.

47
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,330
This becomes a 10.

48
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,060
10 minus 7 is 30.

49
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,810
And so there's nothing
left to bring down.

50
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,510
so we now know that 35 goes into
1,500 forty-two times,

51
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,950
but there's a remainder of 30.

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,550
If he mowed 42 lawns, he'd
be 30 short of 1,500.

53
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,320
35 times 42 is 30
less than 1,500.

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,090
What would it be?

55
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,240
1,470.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,300
So in order to make 1,500, he's
going to have to go over

57
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,350
it, so he's going to have to
do one more lawn than this.

58
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,750
So just to remind ourselves,
if we just divide-- let me

59
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,260
write it here.

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:06,160
1,500 divided by 35 is equal
to 42, remainder 30, so 42

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,430
won't be enough lawns.

62
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,630
We're going to have more to-- we
have 30 more bucks to earn,

63
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,560
so he's going to have to mow one
more lawn to get another

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,110
$35, so he's going to have
$5 left over after he

65
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,470
makes up this 30.

66
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,780
So he's going to have to mow 43
lawns if he really wants to

67
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,640
cross this threshold of $1500.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,480
If he does mow the 43 lawns,
he'll have more than $1500.

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,690
He'll actually have $5
more than $1500.

70
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,134

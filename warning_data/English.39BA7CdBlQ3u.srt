1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
sharing some of the problems.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and making it kind of an annual thing.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because I think there are some very important problems

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that don't get worked on naturally.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to do the right things.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And only by paying attention to these things

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
can we make as much progress as we need to.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and talk about where they stand.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is to look at childhood deaths.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a phenomenal thing.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Each one of those lives matters a lot.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but also a few key breakthroughs:

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
vaccines that were used more widely.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
For example, measles was four million of the deaths

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
back as recently as 1990

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and now is under 400,000.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we really can make changes.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why? Well there's only a few diseases

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, what's the history of this disease?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it's the only disease we can see

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that people who lived in Africa

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So it was absolutely gigantic.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And the disease was all over the world.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So it was everywhere.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And so that's why the death rate did come down.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now, ironically, what happened was

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which is where the rich countries are.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
1945, it's still most places.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And so this leads to the paradox that

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it doesn't get much investment.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
than are put into malaria.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
(Laughter)

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And rich men are afflicted.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And so that's why that priority has been set.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But, malaria --

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
greatly understate its impact.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because it just holds things back so much.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
(Laughter)

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Those mosquitos are not infected.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And bed nets are a great tool.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and those nets

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And that's happened now in a number of countries.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's great to see.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But we have to be careful because malaria --

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And so you end up with two choices.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you do it vigorously,

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you can actually get a local eradication.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and the death rate will soar back up again.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now we're on the upswing.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Bed net funding is up.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There's new drug discovery going on.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that starts in a couple months.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So we're going to have these new tools.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because the road map to get rid of this disease

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
involves many things.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to keep the visibility high,

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to tell the success stories.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It involves social scientists,

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
but 90 percent.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And so as these elements come together,

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm quite optimistic

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now let me turn to a second question,

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and we'd understand very well.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And the answer is, really, that we don't.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's start with why this is important.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We all had a wonderful education.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's part of the reason we're here today,

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
part of the reason we're successful.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I had great teachers.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
is starting to fade on a relative basis,

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to people with a better education.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And we have to change this.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We have to change it so that the country is strong

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and stays at the forefront

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
of things that are driven by advanced education,

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
like science and mathematics.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When I first learned the statistics,

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And that had been covered up for a long time

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
because they always took the dropout rate as the number

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They had to raise the stated dropout rate

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
as soon as that tracking was done

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to over 30 percent.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And even if you graduate from high school,

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
if you're low-income,

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you're low-income in the United States,

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you have a higher chance of going to jail

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
than you do of getting a four-year degree.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So, how do you make education better?

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There's many people working on it.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We've worked on small schools,

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
we've funded scholarships,

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
we've done things in libraries.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A lot of these things had a good effect.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
was the very key thing.

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And we hooked up with some people studying

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
how much variation is there between teachers,

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and the bottom quartile.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
based on test scores --

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
by over 10 percent in a single year.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What does that mean?

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
had top quartile teachers,

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We should retain those people.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What do they look like?

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You might think these must be very senior teachers.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And the answer is no.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Once somebody has taught for three years

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The variation is very, very small.

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You might think these are people with master's degrees.

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This chart takes four different factors

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
is a master's degree.

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
One is seniority.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Teach for America: slight effect.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There are some people who are very good at this.

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And we've done almost nothing

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
to study what that is

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and to draw it in and to replicate it,

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to raise the average capability --

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And it's a system with very high turnover.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's an unbelievable thing.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and what goes on is great teaching.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They take the poorest kids,

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.

253
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is very different than in the normal public schools.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They're taking data, the test scores,

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
at first it's very bizarre.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What's going on?"

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
which kids were bored,

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was a very dynamic environment,

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
keeping people engaged and setting the tone

271
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Everybody needs to be involved.

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And so KIPP is doing it.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How does that compare to a normal school?

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The data isn't gathered.

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
In the teacher's contract,

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
sometimes to once per year.

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And they need advanced notice to do that.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
some of them just making crap

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."

287
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They don't have the test scores,

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
For example, New York passed a law

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
in the tenure decision for the teachers.

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But I'm optimistic about this,

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think there are some clear things we can do.

296
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and that's given us the picture of where we are.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,

299
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.

300
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Of course, digital video is cheap now.

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Putting a few cameras in the classroom

302
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
is very practical in all public schools.

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down

305
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.

307
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You can take those great courses and make them available

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you have a kid who's behind,

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,

316
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
we can do it much better.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
the place that this is going on --

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I thought it was so fantastic.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
(Applause)

327
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now, we put a lot of money into education,

328
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,

332
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and it was taken out in the Senate

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
because there are people who are threatened by these things.

334
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But I -- I'm optimistic.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,

336
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I only had time to frame those two problems.

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There's a lot more problems like that --

339
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
just at the very name of these things.

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.

342
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.

344
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So it's going to take brilliant people like you

346
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
to study these things, get other people involved --

347
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and you're helping to come up with solutions.

348
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Thank you.

350
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:58,000
(Applause)

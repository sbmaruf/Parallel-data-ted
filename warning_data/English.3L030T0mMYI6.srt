1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,984
This is another problem that Kortaggio sent me,

2
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:05,190
and I like these problems a lot

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,146
because they seem fairly simple on the surface,

4
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:10,010
and actually the solutions are pretty simple.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,300
But just the nature of the lack of information they give,

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,314
it becomes kind of hard to even get started with these problems.

7
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,820
And I'll be frank, this problem, I kind of stumbled

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,101
around with it for a couple of minutes until I finally realized

9
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:25,210
what they were asking for or how to solve for it.

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,491
So in this problem, we have Bev,

11
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:31,000
and she takes a train home at 4 o'clock.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,760
She arrives at the station at 6 o'clock.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,132
Every day, driving at the same rate,

14
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:38,630
her husband meets her at the station.

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,450
Fair enough.

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,840
One day, she takes the train an hour early and arrives at 5:00.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,716
Her husband leaves home to meet her at the same usual time.

18
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,860
Husband leaves home to meet her at the usual time.

19
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,180
So maybe an interesting thing is to think about

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,810
when does the husband normally leave?

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,300
So let's say that this is a normal scenario.

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,700
I'll do that in green.

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,000
At 6 o'clock, she arrives.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,530
We got there.

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,130
She arrives at the station at 6 o'clock.

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,730
I don't know if this 4 o'clock is useful yet.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,530
And the husband, he gets there right when she gets there.

28
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,776
So he traveled-- he gets there, and I don't know if I'm--

29
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:22,400
maybe I should draw a more--

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,537
well, let me just draw it this way.

31
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:27,150
I think this is how my brain kind of handles it.

32
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,960
So he gets there.

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,760
And when did he have to leave?

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,610
What was his time?

35
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,960
So let's say it takes him t minutes to get there,

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,750
whatever t is given in.

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,267
So if he gets there at 6 o'clock,

38
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,260
that means he left at 6 o'clock minus t.

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,400
If t is 30 minutes, it would be 5:30.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,000
If t is one hour, it would be 5 o'clock.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,600
So leaves at 6 o'clock minus t.

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,970
And t, whatever units t happens to be.

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,450
Then he picks her up, and what does he do?

44
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,150
He goes back home, right?

45
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,910
He goes back home.

46
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,250
Let me do that with a-- I'll do that with a skinnier line.

47
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,936
He goes back home, same distance.

48
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:16,890
We assume that the car just turns around immediately,

49
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,530
and that there's no time devoted to picking her up.

50
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,960
She just kind of jumps on the car as he spins around.

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,520
So it should take him the same amount of time, right, t.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,890
So when does he arrive back at home?

53
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,940
So if it took him-- he left t minutes before 6 o'clock and

54
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,020
got there, so when does he get back?

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,720
Well, it's going to take him t minutes to get back,

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,020
so he's going to arrive at 6 o'clock plus t.

57
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,670
And so what was the total amount of time

58
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,280
that he traveled?

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,650
And this is almost superficially easy.

60
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,420
Well, if you-- 6 o'clock plus t minus 6 o'clock minus t,

61
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,180
the difference in time is just 2t.

62
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,830
He traveled a distance of-- or a total time of 2t minutes,

63
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,120
and that's almost obvious.

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,310
If it takes him t minutes to go and t minutes to come back,

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,130
he traveled t minutes.

66
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,240
Fair enough.

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,370
Now, what happened on this day?

68
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,420
It says that he leaves-- her husband leaves home

69
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,790
to meet her at the usual time.

70
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,810
So once again, he is going to leave-- he leaves--

71
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,520
I'll do this in red.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:22,780
He leaves at 6 o'clock minus t, right?

73
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,147
And then, she arrived early.

74
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,622
So she's going to be walking back.

75
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,510
So there's going to be some smaller time

76
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,250
than it takes him to reach her.

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,530
So let's just leave that unlabeled right now.

78
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,254
So if I have a line here--

79
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,204
so he's going to travel a shorter distance,

80
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:39,350
and, of course, it's going to take him less time

81
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,150
because she started walking.

82
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,440
That's what the problem tells us, right?

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,420
Today she arrives at 5 o'clock, and she begins to walk home.

84
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,995
So she's going to make some distance up

85
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,650
so he's not going to have to travel quite as far.

86
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,810
And then whatever time that was,

87
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,710
he goes back the other way.

88
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,360
It's going to be the same amount of time.

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,670
It's the same amount of time.

90
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,130
And what does it tell us?

91
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,735
He meets her on the way,

92
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,870
and then they arrive home 20 minutes early.

93
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,910
So normally, they arrive at 6 o'clock plus t, right?

94
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,820
That's normal.

95
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,800
So today, they're going to arrive 20 minutes early.

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,930
So they're going to arrive at, you could say, 6 o'clock

97
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,830
plus t-- that's just that-- minus 20 minutes, right?

98
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,690
They're going to arrive 20 minutes early.

99
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,059
So what's the total amount of time

100
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,220
that he would have traveled on that day?

101
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,110
The total amount of time?

102
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,480
Well, he essentially travels 20 minutes less than

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
he does on a normal day, right?

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,630
He leaves at the same time and he gets there 20 minutes early.

105
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,234
And if you take the difference between 6+t-20 and 6-t,

106
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:50,490
you're going to get 2t-20.

107
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,501
And that's almost--

108
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,750
I probably didn't even have to draw all of this.

109
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,545
You could just say, well, you know, on a regular day,

110
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,990
it takes them two-- if t is the amount of time,

111
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,564
it normally takes him to go to the station,

112
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:03,080
on a normal day, he travels 2t minutes.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,140
Today, he leaves at the same time, gets 20 minutes early,

114
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,870
so he travels 2t minus 20 minutes.

115
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,950
Fair enough.

116
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,110
Now, what does that tell us?

117
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,630
Well, how long did it take him to get to her?

118
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,200
How long did this take her?

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,410
Well, to go to pick her up takes the same amount of time

120
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,620
as to come back, so he must have taken half of this time to go

121
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,940
and half of this time to come back.

122
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,650
So it must have been t minus 10 to go,

123
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,340
and then t minus 10 to come back.

124
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,800
So it took him 10 minutes less to reach her this time.

125
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,630
So what time does he pick her up?

126
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,570
And this is the key.

127
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,090
So normally, when it takes him t minutes,

128
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,820
he gets there at 6 o'clock.

129
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,040
This time she started walking because she got there early,

130
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,590
and he gets there 10 minutes--

131
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,851
he reaches her 10 minutes earlier than

132
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,910
he normally would have reached her, right? t minus 10.

133
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,020
Normally, he reaches her at 6 o'clock.

134
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,340
Today he reaches her 10 minutes earlier.

135
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,740
So he reaches her at 5:50.

136
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,750
Now, the question is, how many minutes did Bev walk?

137
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,500
How many minutes did Bev walk?

138
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,340
Remember, she arrived an hour early and arrives at 5 o'clock,

139
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,550
and then she starts walking.

140
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,250
She arrives at 5:00, 5 o'clock, and just starts walking.

141
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,330
And when does he pick her up?

142
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,950
He picks her up at 5:50.

143
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,540
So she walked for 50 minutes.

144
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,900
That's a neat problem.

145
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,246
Because on some level, it's very easy,

146
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,463
but on a lot of other levels,

147
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:39,110
they give you all of this other information that's not necessary.

148
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,870
For example, you don't have to know that

149
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,287
she leaves at 4 o'clock. That's actually probably

150
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:45,670
the most unnecessary piece of information.

151
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,480
But everything else is kind of left abstract.

152
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,472
But even though you can--

153
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:50,030
they're not giving a lot of details.

154
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,780
You can actually figure out how far she walked

155
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,697
without knowing how fast she walks,

156
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,560
or how fast her husband drives,

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,640
or how far they are from the train station,

158
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,670
or how far the house is from the train station, or any of that.

159
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,970
You're still able to figure out how far she walked.

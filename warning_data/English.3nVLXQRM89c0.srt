24
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:56,033
the story really here tonight was takenin the main from facts on file in the

25
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,719
los angeles police department

26
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,025
we have air force chief of police beingdebated to preface our program he paid

good evening ladies and gentlemen

28
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:08,009
sometimes the most dramatic work on thepart of the peace officer

29
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,299
goes unnoticed by the rank and file ofthe city's people

30
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:15,559
simply because network has not beenblaze moon headlines

31
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:18,299
sometimes an important case is broken

32
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,709
but the story behind it never breaks

33
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,189
for the average peace officer does notwant publicity

34
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,759
he does not needed

35
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,094
he does his duty as he sees it

36
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:30,479
and does not look for praise

37
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,599
the vast majority of criminal cases wereinvestigated and cold without them there

38
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,809
such as our story tonight

39
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,003
because person still living might beheard

40
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:43,689
by the broadcasters certain factssurrounding our story

41
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,849
we have purposely change both local andpersonnel

42
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,749
it is our desire to present our problemswithout harm to anyone

43
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,659
but to bring out most certainly

44
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,199
but crime of any sort is an unprofitableenterprise

45
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:06,599
actual reserve additional facts or theend of the problem

49
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,009

and that isn't going to get youranywhere

51
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:25,063
and thinking i thought then doing dayand night thinking think if that

52
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:29,009
medication wouldn't be talking like anidiot i might need it because the whole

53

61
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,189
my reason for that many of them a issufficiently logic and a satisfying the

62
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:54,179
even that's a big help business

63
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,379
how relevant the marion on tell you havea logical reason why we shouldn't get

171
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:00,086
each witness male is letter grades

172
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:05,004
turned places on the steps

173
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,036

i'll go to a couple months

175
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,031
they're going to probably what got

176
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:13,006
role would go to deliver to real puffyand it's a red herring i believe i told

177
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:18,072
you believe i am not through with mrritter i think that the caller we get to

178
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,076
they've all week

179
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,008
lookup

180
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,989
one hundred

181
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:24,075
earlier kachigian

182
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:26,769
accordion with water hain

183
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,078
and public admit that

184
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,017
across passed out

185
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:34,041
colored optimistic but i'll get a lot ofmyself number one the water curled

186
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,088
from under water

187
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:43,085
and uh...

188
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:47,064
further investigation shows qwestofficedot was due to cyanide poisoning but how

189
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:51,001
would that have gone with the ministerof my home was still a mystery

190
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:55,051
open water the homeless on the tablesign the consent of ryan to investigate

191
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:58,000
something wrong in this whiskey thesandy

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,007
something we will look kinda about thatwhen i'm in the end of one of my dreams

193
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:04,077
i noticed that the papers this morningfor michael new or heart failure dead

194
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:08,019
that's fine long as they felt that waywe'll have time to work

195
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,094
it's when they start yelling murderwithout anything to go on that i get

196
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:14,005
worried when i still can't see how mencan die from cyanide poisoning and was

197
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:19,002
he dubbed himself or somebody gave it tohim yeah that's on this for grogram but

198
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:23,017
obviously needed big according to thestories we've gotten so far the reform

199
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,013
in in that room

200
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:26,007
none of the mcveigh touching anything

201
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,001
none of them so anything you cannot go

202
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,049
yet suddenly one of the public over dead

203
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,028
from simon and could have been suicide

204
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:33,088
i don't think so

205
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,053
evidently westcott was telling them allready to go to

206
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,036
he seemed entirely in command of thesituation

207
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:42,005
nine think he would be the last one ofthe group that everything for suicide

208
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:45,033
when a person who are overlookedsomething important meantime the guy the

209
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:48,003
dishes out cyanide in small doses aschool

210
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,034
that's right

211
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:51,099
and want to boys to go over thatwhispered pleas from some of the

212
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:52,007
wreckage

213
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,269
and bring west that's popular

214
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,037
young westcott

215
00:10:55,037 --> 00:11:08,095
and that ritter bird back here

216
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:11,043

222
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,007

that's more of a little

303

622
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:53,023
i think this program is probably doing

as any other single agency

625

there'd be a lot more happen is allaround

1078
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:56,879
it has always been a mystery to me howanyone in his right mind

1079
01:00:56,879 --> 01:01:01,289
will allow himself to be sold socompletely by spurious producer

that he will someday be a big shot inthe movies

1083
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:12,119
one of the most constantly recurringproblems the police have to deal with

1084
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,729
is that of some unsuspecting person

1085
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:20,109
letting his life savings there were someunscrupulous let's move down from over

01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:26,609
even though the criminal in this casewas caught and punished

1088
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:29,589
the fact remains that a lot of peoplewould have been better off

1089
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:31,979
if they had stayed away from hollywood

1090

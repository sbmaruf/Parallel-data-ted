1
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:10,089
What are you doing?Why don't you run away?

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,549
<i>Nice to meet you, Miss Jang Man Ok.

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,532
<i>Just know that I will report Take One or whatever as the thief of my scooter. Do as you wish.

4
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:18,433
<i>Hey, you thief!

5
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,892
<i>My apologies are put in here.

6
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:21,895
<i>You needn't.

7
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:26,949
<i>This and that can happen in life.

8
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,355
<i> Why should I go there?

9
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:29,872
<i> Then, should I send him in that condition?

10
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:32,848
<i> I was really looking forward to this shoot.

11
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,143
<i>I said I don't want to do it!

12
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:35,643
<i> Don't you know I don't like kids?

13
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:37,446
<i> Are you going to keep acting like this?

14
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:41,406
<i> If that's how bad you don't want to do it, then break the contract and leave!

15
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:45,281
<i> What is "Paing, Paing"?

16
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:46,595
<i> I dislocated my arm...

17
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,864
<i> I need to go to the hapkido (type of martial arts) studio.

18
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:53,082
<i> Careful, it hurts.

19
00:00:53,082 --> 00:01:00,089
<i> We meet again like this.

20
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,162
<i> Lee Tae Ik!

21
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:04,211
<i>What is this horrible photo?

22
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:07,784
<i>Man Ok Kwan? Is it a Chinese restaurant?

23
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,803
<i>Tell her to get rid of the photo immediately and shut down her homepage.

24
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,386
<i>What revenge does she have against me that this kind of photo...?

25
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:14,056
<i>What is this?

26
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:17,902
<i>This is the hapkido studio which Tae Ik visited, right?

27
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:19,417
Yes, it is.

28
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,524
<i>I sent Secretary Hwang there, so he will take care of it.

29
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:22,888
<i>Secretary Hwang?

30
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,452
<i>Using the photo without permission.

31
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,922
<i>Illegally using his name and infringing on his portrait rights.

32
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,401
<i>We will take steps immediately to sue you.

33
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,054
<i>You know where Take One's lodging is, right?

34
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:36,339
<i> Episode 2 Part 2

35
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:41,116
<i>Settlement? Then you aren't going to sue me?

36
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:45,641
<i>If we go to court and this gets into the tabloid, it is not good for our clients either.

37
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,315
<i>The damage to their image is inevitable.

38
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:52,319
<i>So our position is that we would rather get a settlement than go to court.

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,499
<i> Then...how should I...?

40
00:01:55,499 --> 00:02:01,968
<i>Shut down your homepage immediately and the settlement fee is 30 million won. We can't yield anymore.

41
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:05,887
30 million is no joke.

42
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:09,058
Ah, what should I do?

43
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:17,075
Jang Man Ok! Look at your posture. Where there is a will...

44
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:19,878
There is a way.

45
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,054
That's right! If I give them everything they ask, I am an idiot.

46
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:46,263
I will go and settle it with the person directly.

47
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:49,984
What? Is she going inside?

48
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,039
Come out! Where do you think you are going? Come out quickly.

49
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,686
I have business here. Let me go!

50
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:01,488
Don't you know who I am?

51
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:05,011
Hey, ahjussi!

52
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:08,024
What the? Move.

53
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,775
This unni is completely devoid of sense!

54
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,063
There are rules here, too.

55
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:18,611
No matter how much you like oppa, you can't force yourself into the office.

56
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,686
Move out of the way!

57
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:25,181
This unni has urgent business and must see this Tae Ik or whoever.

58
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:28,562
What did you say? You called oppa "Tae Ik or whoever"?

59
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:31,563
Is this Ahjumma really crazy?

60
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:32,694
"Ahjumma" (Older-Woman)?

61
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:34,584
Hey guys! Tae Ik oppa has appeared!

62
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:41,849
Where, where? Where is he?

63
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,093
What the? Where are you all going? To meet Tae Ik?

64
00:03:46,093 --> 00:04:11,048
Girls, lets go together! Hey, girls! Hey, girls!

65
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:17,817
Hey, girls... just a moment. This unni has business so just a moment.

66
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:24,017
I'm sorry. Sorry.

67
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:28,527
Look here. If you step on someone's foot you should apologize.

68
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:55,937
Tae Ik!

69
00:04:55,937 --> 00:05:05,337
What is all this?

70
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:15,428
What is this?

71
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,228
It's off-limits now.

72
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,858
Off-limits? What is the problem?

73
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:23,261
What are you doing in someone else's studio? Who are all those people?

74
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,867
By any chance, are you the owner of the studio?

75
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,007
Yes, I am the master here.

76
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:32,514
Illegal gambling took place at the studio. The police who were on ambush duty caught all of them in the act and arrested them.

77
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,194
You didn't know?

78
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:40,048
Gambling? In my studio? But... who?

79
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,707
That person is that...

80
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:42,921
Do you know him?

81
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,024
Yes...but...well...

82
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:47,309
You have to accompany us to the police station briefly.

83
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:50,935
What?

84
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:54,995
How many times do I have to tell you? I am really innocent.

85
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:58,534
Miss, look here. You even received money for providing the gambling house.

86
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:01,998
No. I haven't received it yet.

87
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:04,301
You haven't received it yet...

88
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,065
So, it means that you were to receive money, right?

89
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,705
That's not it. I really swear that...

90
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,525
they said they are going to practice dancing or something like that...

91
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:15,877
This ahjussi said that he needs a place for his association to practice.

92
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,071
I just lent it to get usage fees.

93
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:20,751
Miss, think about it reasonably.

94
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,198
Gambling which entails tens of millions of won going back and forth took place,

95
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:25,581
does it make sense that the owner of the house didn't know about it?

96
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,257
Tens of millions of won?

97
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:32,845
Wow! They have grit! How could they bet tens of millions of won...?

98
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:36,947
But you said that you would give me just 200,000 won? You are cheap!

99
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:41,313
Miss, if you get hooked on that kind of money, you'll be in trouble.

100
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:45,917
Like me. I only look for Oriental paintings.

101
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:50,686
Ahjussi, do you know the sorrow of a migratory bird?

102
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,894
He settles down with difficulty.

103
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:55,162
But he has to escape if the police appear.

104
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:59,015
Then he settles down with difficulty there, but he has to escape again when the police appear.

105
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:02,886
She only accepted me with the love for migratory birds.

106
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:06,929
If she is guilty, it is only for providing me with a location.

107
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:10,671
Be quiet. What did you do right to interfere?

108
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,808
Whatever. For lending your studio to compulsive gamblers after receiving money...

109
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,934
It is definitely your mistake. Alright?

110
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,842
So, even if you don't get sued for criminal charges,

111
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:22,379
you should be prepared for at least suspension of business and getting fined.

112
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,191
Keep that in mind and you may go.

113
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:28,777
Sus.. suspension... of business?

114
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,047
A good citizen was scammed by swindlers

115
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,381
and has incurred damages.

116
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:38,947
Far from comforting me, what do you mean by suspension of business?

117
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:40,554
The public police...

118
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:42,606
to a good citizen...

119
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:49,745
can you do this?

120
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:53,934
I can't budge one step from here till I am proved innocent.

121
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:56,336
Police Investigator Park!

122
00:07:56,336 --> 00:08:00,856
Miss, there is no use doing this here.

123
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,747
Let go of this!

124
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:07,615
How could the public police use violence against a good citizen?

125
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,058
It is something that can't take place in a democratic country.

126
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:15,553
Let go! Let go!

127
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:19,725
Ahjussi, get me a short sentence this time.

128
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:22,868
How could this be in a democratic country? <i>Closed Till the 15th Because of Master Training.

129
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,583
Why does a good citizen have to undergo something like this?

130
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,151
Suspension of business, does this even make sense?

131
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:31,009
Be quiet. Don't spread it in the neighborhood.

132
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,194
Sorry. I'm really sorry, friend.

133
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:39,885
But even Mrs. Hong really didn't know that he was a gambler.

134
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,004
Mrs. Hong said that she will pay for the penalty and she won't receive rent for the time being.

135
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:46,904
Is the rent the problem now?

136
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:52,016
Manokin Wardrobe has shut down, the studio has closed... what do I live on immediately?

137
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:58,464
Because of that idle and inconvenient Hong mother and daughter, my life is also about to be shut down. Is the rent the problem now?

138
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:02,667
But see, Man Ok, there is always a way out.

139
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,705
You know that thing... borrowing money with collateral.

140
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:09,318
If you somehow endure with that for a little while..I will do everything to...

141
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:10,333
Does it make sense?

142
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,337
How could something like this! Does it make sense?

143
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:16,249
Master Jang, how could you?

144
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,112
Jin Ho's mother.

145
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,083
I refused all the newly constructed studios and to this old studio...

146
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,377
I kept my kids in your charge, trusting only you.

147
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,936
But, how could you? What do you mean by gambling house?

148
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,526
Jin Ho's mother, that's...

149
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,271
Omo! Omo! Look at that! What? Master training?

150
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,898
Do you think we are idiots?

151
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:37,747
It is unbelievable that gambling took place in a studio where children do sports.

152
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:41,152
How could you blatantly lie like this when your business has been suspended.

153
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,714
Seung Won's mother, that is not what happened...

154
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:47,756
There is no need to talk any further. There is no need for people living in the same neighborhood to burn their faces arguing.

155
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,727
Refund our children's fees immediately.

156
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:50,541
What?

157
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,143
Then? They won't be able to do sports for months because of the suspension.

158
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:58,333
Am I to let my kids do nothing at all during that time?

159
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,913
No, you must not.

160
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:11,157
Alright, I will refund it immediately today.

161
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:18,888
Client, the amount for closing the Happy Installment Savings Account is 3,610,000 won. Please check it.

162
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,146
Excuse me, client.

163
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:53,513
Ah! Yes.

164
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:55,924
Hello?

165
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,355
Yes, Grandpa!

166
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,135
Did somebody die?

167
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:04,066
Why are you receiving the phone call with a sigh?

168
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:08,599
I exercised hard and so I am tired.

169
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,633
Jang Man Ok.

170
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,067
There is no problem at the studio, right?

171
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,689
Pardon?

172
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,878
Problem? What problem? There is no problem, Grandpa.

173
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:24,165
Really? I called because I have had disturbing dreams for the past few days.

174
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:28,041
Jang Man Ok, guard the studio well. Where there is a will...

175
00:11:28,041 --> 00:12:11,632
There is a way.

176
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:21,034
If Grandpa finds out that the studio was ordered to suspend business temporarily.

177
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:28,503
Jang Man Ok.

178
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:32,575
For a martial artist, honor is life

179
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:38,754
You dirtied honor which is like life. Jang Man Ok.

180
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:45,965
Be determined.

181
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:58,459
Ya!

182
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:05,385
I deserve to die. Yes, a human like me deserves to die.

183
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:20,164
Why did I do that?

184
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:23,079
This is all because of you.

185
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,746
You make all this havoc because I used one photo?

186
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,609
If your arm got dislocated, you should have gone to the hospital?

187
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,052
Why do you come to someone else’s studio and cause trouble?

188
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,694
If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have lent the studio.

189
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,915
Then there wouldn’t have been any gambling.

190
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,092
And there would have been no temporary suspension of business.

191
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:46,334
Ah, seriously! If I catch you with my hands, you are dead!

192
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:52,791
Ms. Jang Man Ok?

193
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,174
Yes, I am Jang Man Ok.

194
00:13:56,174 --> 00:14:04,031
He… here… pa… pa… parcel service.

195
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:14,479
What was that?

196
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:20,929
It’s the shirt that Sir Me ordered.

197
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,653
You are the last order for Manokin Wardrobe.

198
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:31,959
Please pay attention to the delivery. I request, please.

199
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:55,564
Alright. It’s the last one.

200
00:14:55,564 --> 00:15:00,687
It’s the last one, so I should at least provide this kind of service.

201
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:04,747
Sir Me will wear it well.

202
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:26,006
Wow! The house is nice.

203
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:30,086
Go Dong!

204
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:34,254
Go Dong!

205
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:43,051
Where did he go again?

206
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:47,461
Is nobody in?

207
00:15:47,461 --> 00:16:07,069
That’s right! I was asked to call before making the delivery.

208
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:14,201
Oh! What are you? How did you know about this place to come here?

209
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,799
It seems you live here?

210
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,089
You wouldn’t see me no matter how I went to see you. How did I run into you in a place like this?

211
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,691
What are you? A stalker?

212
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,856
Are you Won Kang Hwi’s W.P?

213
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:26,202
W what?

214
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:29,777
W.P. Don’t you know? Wicked private fan.

215
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:33,641
Even if we are in the same team, one who only takes care of the member one likes. A person just like you!

216
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:36,614
Though I have an imaginary friend, I don’t know about W.P.

217
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:39,761
I feel bad enough about (being called) the stalker, what do you think of me?

218
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:43,664
You are wicked!

219
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,151
When you sell out someone else’s face with a wretched photo,

220
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:49,601
where do you think this is that you shamelessly come here? Aish!

221
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:54,791
What? What did you say? Wicked?

222
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,378
What is this?

223
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:59,481
- What? What did you say? - What is the problem? - Wicked?

224
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:02,088
Hey! You jerk! Come back here!

225
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,961
You crazy…! Are you really crazy?

226
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:09,972
First, come out. Oh! Oh! Come out when I speak nicely. ! Come out quickly!

227
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:13,662
Come out! Hey! Come out quickly!

228
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:18,275
Take responsibility for everything.Take responsibility for everything. You bastard!

229
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,045
Responsibility?

230
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:23,915
What is this?

231
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:25,374
That guy… perhaps…!

232
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,449
I said take responsibility.

233
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,348
If you are a celebrity, do you think you can do anything? Is it such a big deal if your face was embarrassed?

234
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,037
Who are you to tell me to shut down my homepage?

235
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:38,796
Fine. I was really wrong in using your photo without saying anything.

236
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:42,738
But, do you have to take the bread out of somebody’s mouth to feel relieved?

237
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:48,934
For you it is just a matter of getting embarrassed and irritated. But for me it is a matter of making a living.

238
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,136
Were you able to sleep comfortably after taking the bread out of somebody’s mouth?

239
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,497
To me, this face is how I make my precious livelihood?

240
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:58,682
You are the one who touched my livelihood first. Do you know that?

241
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:01,839
You live luxuriously in a place like this and how can you speak of livelihood?

242
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,544
How big is this place? 100 pyeong (1 pyeong = 3.3 square meters)?

243
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,612
No, it’s more than 1,000 pyeong, right?

244
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:09,978
But what? I am really dumbfounded.

245
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:15,349
You are the just like that person who insists that’s his entire fortune is only 270,000 won.

246
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:24,168
Why? You have nothing to say, right?

247
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:26,907
Where are you going? You bastard!

248
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:31,285
Come out! You aren’t coming out?

249
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:56,173
Am I that easy? You bastard!

250
00:18:56,173 --> 00:19:00,618
It’s bitter! You are really pitiful, Jang Man Ok.

251
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:07,381
What are you going to do now? You don’t even have immediate living expenses.

252
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:10,843
30 million won?

253
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:14,113
I’m drinking soju without eating anything along with it because I have no money.

254
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,868
30 million won?

255
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:45,082
How do I provide it?

256
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:49,662
If I sell this, how much will it be worth?

257
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:52,827
Michelle, should we try this once?

258
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:56,827
Here. Let’s take a look. How pretty is our daughter?

259
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:59,487
Wow! It suits you really well.

260
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,851
Mom, can’t you give me this.

261
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:05,031
Should I? Do you want it?

262
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:05,851
Dad, am I pretty?

263
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,957
The best! Our Michelle is the best!

264
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,094
Turn around like a model.

265
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:12,372
So pretty!

266
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:17,406
Should we try it on your head?

267
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,816
You are prettier than mom.

268
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:22,083
Of course you should be prettier than mom, our daughter!

269
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,015
- What?- Kiss.

270
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,122
What about mom?

271
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:32,101
Oh, this pretty kid.

272
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:36,264
Jang Man Ok! No, Michelle Jang!

273
00:20:36,264 --> 00:21:04,387
No matter what happens, you mustn’t touch this. Never!

274
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:07,006
Huh? It's Kang Hwi.

275
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:13,446
But why would Kang Hwi be here...?

276
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:20,205
I am seeing things now. You're drunk, you're drunk, Jang Man Ok.

277
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:23,105
Excuse me... Jang Man Ok.

278
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:34,772
This person is really!

279
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:36,308
What's this?

280
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:43,479
Is it really Kang Hwi?

281
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:47,763
What to do?

282
00:21:47,763 --> 00:21:52,555
Kang Hwi Nim!

283
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:54,722
Why did you do that?

284
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:58,295
Why did you come here to get into this kind of thing?

285
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:00,693
So... how much will be this be worth?

286
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:04,046
They are people who ask for 30 million won because I used one photo.

287
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:11,186
But I touched this precious body. Would it be 40 million? No, 50 million?

288
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:16,056
Really! Why am I like this?

289
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:20,789
But... why won't he wake up?

290
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:34,064
No ways...

291
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:35,055
Are you alright?

292
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:49,672
Ah! My head!

293
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:55,923
These are the props that came on Manokine Wardrobe.

294
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:58,303
Wait a second.

295
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:01,105
Perhaps...

296
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:03,654
These are all authentic?

297
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:07,996
Excuse me, Kang Hwi. Do you know Manokine Wardrobe?

298
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:16,084
Of course, I do. It's me, it's me.

299
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:19,591
My ID is Sir Me!

300
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:21,601
It is that outfit!

301
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:28,035
Do you know now? Do you know how much I wanted to wear this?

302
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:37,651
You are glad to see me, right?

303
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:48,959
It's about time the outfit from Manokine Wardrobe should be arriving. How far has it come?

304
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,035
But why?

305
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:55,599
Why would it suddenly close down?

306
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,454
What am I to do now? What do I do about my clothes now? Aish!

307
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:05,359
No ways... did that jerk Lee Tae Ik cause a problem?

308
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,622
No ways... did he sue her for violating his portrait rights?

309
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:14,024
This doesn't make sense. It wasn't even photographed well.

310
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:24,064
What am I to do now?

311
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,549
Bae Go Dong, where are you now?

312
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,834
I'm in a meeting. I'm hanging up.

313
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:31,869
What?

314
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:37,793
Hey....Hey!

315
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,861
What is this?

316
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:42,034
I'm curious to death.

317
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,369
Come out now when I say it nicely. You!

318
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,657
Come out quickly!

319
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:47,644
Hey! Come out quickly!

320
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:52,093
That's weird. There is no way that Lee Tae Ik would cause girl problems.

321
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:53,648
Who are you to tell me to close down my homepage?

322
00:24:53,648 --> 00:25:01,037
I was really wrong in using your photo without saying anything.

323
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:04,402
What are you doing and not escaping?

324
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,812
Why is mannequin unni here?

325
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:08,035
Your name?

326
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,753
I am Jang Man Ok.

327
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:12,291
Jang Man Ok

328
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:16,613
Jang Man Ok... Manokine... Manokine... Manokine...

329
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:24,037
Then the owner of Manokine Wardrobe?

330
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:31,953
I'm really sorry. Man Ok, you saved me but I shouldn't have brought up the photo?

331
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:37,701
But I really didn't know that Man Ok, you were the owner of Manokine Wardrobe.

332
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:42,347
I am really sorry. It became like this against my will. I'm really sorry.

333
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:48,201
No! You didn't do it knowingly. It's not something that Kang Hwi, you should be sorry about.

334
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:54,088
It's me who is sorry for inflicting a wound against my will.

335
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:58,045
The hospital fee...

336
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:04,024
I don't have any money to give you... But I will pay you as soon as I earn money.

337
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:09,694
So... can you not sue me?

338
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:19,639
Sue you? Hey! I'm fine!

339
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:23,407
How can I sue you for something like this, Man Ok?

340
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,919
I really am okay.

341
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,844
Instead... the lawsuit and the shutting down of your homepage... you must have suffered quite a blow.

342
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:37,891
Yes... that is... a lot.

343
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:42,096
Since there is also something I am sorry about...

344
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:45,049
Those vintage outfits...

345
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,289
I will pay you much more than the market price at the shop, so sell them all to me, huh?

346
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:51,735
I can't do that.

347
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,556
Why? Sell them.

348
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:55,853
I will really pay a lot.

349
00:26:55,853 --> 00:27:00,246
And Man Ok you are saying this because you don't know very well... but those pretty looking babies must...

350
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:03,329
meet a proper owner like me.

351
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:12,378
That is... they are articles left behind by my deceased parents.

352
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:24,189
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't even know that.

353
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,976
Man Ok, did you make this?

354
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:29,964
Yes.

355
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:33,603
You made all the designs in Manokine Wardrobe?

356
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:36,937
Yes, by just using them.

357
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:40,139
Man Ok, would you like to work with us?

358
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,655
Pardon?

359
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:44,079
Our stylist quit sometime back.

360
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,119
Under the condition that we use all the props here, how about becoming our Take One stylist?

361
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,297
Take One?

362
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,458
That is slightly...

363
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,879
Instead, I will make sure you get a handsome salary.

364
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:59,078
I will tell them to deduct the settlement money from your salary.

365
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,139
And if it goes well, they could reduce it for you.

366
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,098
Really?

367
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:08,039
<i>You are wicked! You sell someone else's face with a wretched photo.

368
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,605
<i>Where do you think this is for you to come here shamelessly?

369
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:17,095
Kang Hwi, I can't do this.

370
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:22,719
Why? With your talent, you can do it sufficiently.

371
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,089
Who is born a stylist?

372
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,939
That's not it.

373
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,326
Then? You don't want to work with me?

374
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:33,564
No. I like Kang Hwi... I like you but still...

375
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:36,237
You like me but why? Why?

376
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:40,868
You know that total jerk!

377
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:43,716
The total jerk?

378
00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:45,567
Do you mean Tae Ik?

379
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:48,299
No.

380
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:59,083
It's OK. I have a plan.

381
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:06,003
Is this 100%?

382
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:18,025
You....who are you?

383
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:29,883
<I>Subtitles are brought to you by The Maid of the House 2 Team @ Viki

384
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:32,181
- What is this? - A memorandum for the stylist contract.

385
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:35,241
This is an agreement to keep your mouth shut

386
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:39,266
about the location of Full House and everything that happens inside it.

387
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:42,089
This wasn't a 100%? It itches!

388
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:45,598
A diamond?

389
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:49,198
Let's go to the best place ever.

390
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,044
Here you go!

391
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,646
Please take this.

392
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:52,824
Are you crazy?

393
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,632
I'm dead!

394
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:57,609
Can't you do it quickly?

395
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:59,073
No way.

396
00:29:59,073 --> 99:59:59,999
- Hey.- Oh! my.

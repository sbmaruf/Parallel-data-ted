1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:11,010
Express 0.0000000003457
in scientific notation.

2
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,472
So let's just remind
ourselves what

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,250
it means to be in
scientific notation.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,850
Scientific notation will be some
number times some power of 10

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,330
where this number right here--
let me write it this way.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,340
It's going to be greater
than or equal to 1,

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,790
and it's going to
be less than 10.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,690
So over here, what
we want to put here

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,919
is what that leading
number is going to be.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,420
And in general,
you're going to look

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,990
for the first non-zero digit.

12
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:39,414
And this is the
number that you're

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,740
going to want to start off with.

14
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:43,793
This is the only number you're
going to want to put ahead of

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,490
or I guess to the left
of the decimal point.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:53,200
So we could write
3.457, and it's

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,400
going to be multiplied
by 10 to something.

18
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:57,977
Now let's think about
what we're going

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,380
to have to multiply it by.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:06,110
To go from 3.457 to this
very, very small number,

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,230
from 3.457, to get
to this, you have

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,300
to move the decimal
to the left a bunch.

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,960
You have to add a bunch of
zeroes to the left of the 3.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,720
You have to keep moving the
decimal over to the left.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,540
To do that, we're
essentially making

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,240
the number much
much, much smaller.

27
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:23,606
So we're not going
to multiply it

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,790
by a positive exponent of 10.

29
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,360
We're going to multiply it
times a negative exponent of 10.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,370
The equivalent is
you're dividing

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,830
by a positive exponent of 10.

32
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,407
And so the best way
to think about it,

33
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,130
when you move an
exponent one to the left,

34
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,240
you're dividing by 10, which
is equivalent to multiplying

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,310
by 10 to the negative 1 power.

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,530
Let me give you example here.

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,140
So if I have 1 times 10 is
clearly just equal to 10.

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,750
1 times 10 to the
negative 1, that's

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,140
equal to 1 times 1/10,
which is equal to 1/10.

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,710
1 times-- and let me actually
write a decimal, which is equal

41
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,930
to 0-- let me actually-- I
skipped a step right there.

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,760
Let me add 1 times 10 to the 0,
so we have something natural.

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,600
So this is one times
10 to the first.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
One times 10 to the 0
is equal to 1 times 1,

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,290
which is equal to 1.

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,140
1 times 10 to the negative
1 is equal to 1/10,

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,160
which is equal to 0.1.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,720
If I do 1 times 10
to the negative 2,

49
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:36,825
10 to the negative 2 is 1
over 10 squared or 1/100.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,900
So this is going to be
1/100, which is 0.01.

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,820
What's happening here?

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,640
When I raise it to
a negative 1 power,

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,240
I've essentially
moved the decimal

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,330
from to the right of the
1 to the left of the 1.

55
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,754
I've moved it from
there to there.

56
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,390
When I raise it
to the negative 2,

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,680
I moved it two over to the left.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,390
So how many times are we
going to have to move it over

59
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,730
to the left to get this
number right over here?

60
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,940
So let's think about
how many zeroes we have.

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,010
So we have to move it one time
just to get in front of the 3.

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,040
And then we have to
move it that many more

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,310
times to get all of the zeroes
in there so that we have

64
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,600
to move it one
time to get the 3.

65
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:19,024
So if we started
here, we're going

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:28,130
to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times.

67
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,930
So this is going to be 3.457
times 10 to the negative 10

68
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:33,431
power.

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,390
Let me just rewrite it.

70
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:39,768
So 3.457 times 10 to
the negative 10 power.

71
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,184
So in general,
what you want to do

72
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,450
is you want to find the
first non-zero number here.

73
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,060
Remember, you want a number
here that's between 1 and 10.

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,910
And it can be equal to 1, but
it has to be less than 10.

75
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,320
3.457 definitely fits that bill.

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,760
It's between 1 and 10.

77
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,840
And then you just want
to count the leading

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,640
zeroes between the
decimal and that number

79
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,506
and include the number
because that tells you

80
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,470
how many times you have
to shift the decimal over

81
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,170
to actually get
this number up here.

82
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,036
And so we have to shift
this decimal 10 times

83
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,840
to the left to get
this thing up here.

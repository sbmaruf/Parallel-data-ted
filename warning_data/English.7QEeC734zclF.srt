00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
dates back hundreds of years.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But modernization actually brought communication

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, here you can see the change

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
led me to a new form,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
at that point, and started developing, really,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but to produce to our color specifications.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
At the same time, I was thinking, well,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that could be exported and also service our local market.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
forms. The scale became very important,

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and it's become our pet project. It's successful,

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is our group, our main group of weavers.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They all have bank accounts.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a weekly turnaround of production.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And that's also modernized today,

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the rest says it all.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you very much.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000

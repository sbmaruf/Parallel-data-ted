1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,830
When we compare triangle
ABC to triangle XYZ,

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,450
it's pretty clear that
they aren't congruent,

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,300
that they have very different
lengths of their sides.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,130
But there does seem
to be something

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,120
interesting about the
relationship between these two

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,020
triangles.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,500
One, all of their corresponding
angles are the same.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,620
So the angle right here, angle
BAC, is congruent to angle YXZ.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,640
Angle BCA is congruent
to angle YZX,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,990
and angle ABC is
congruent to angle XYZ.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,550
So all of their corresponding
angles are the same.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,000
And we also see that
the sides are just

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
scaled-up versions
of each other.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,380
So to go from the length of XZ
to AC, we can multiply by 3.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,320
We multiplied by 3 there.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,790
To go from the length of XY
to the length of AB, which

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,960
is the corresponding side,
we are multiplying by 3.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,760
We have to multiply by 3.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,160
And then to go from the length
of YZ to the length of BC,

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,702
we also multiplied by 3.

22
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,830
So essentially,
triangle ABC is just

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,830
a scaled-up version
of triangle XYZ.

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,520
If they were the
same scale, they

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,110
would be the exact
same triangles.

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,162
But one is just a bigger,
a blown-up version

27
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:25,870
of the other one.

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,610
Or this is a miniaturized
version of that one over there.

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,060
If you just multiply
all the sides by 3,

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,700
you get to this triangle.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,230
And so we can't
call them congruent,

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,320
but this does seem to be a
bit of a special relationship.

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,720
So we call this special
relationship similarity.

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,489
So we can write that triangle
ABC is similar to triangle--

35
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,780
and we want to make sure we
get the corresponding sides

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,126
right-- ABC is going
to be similar to XYZ.

37
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:59,810

38
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,450
And so, based on
what we just saw,

39
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,550
there's actually kind
of three ideas here.

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,720
And they're all equivalent ways
of thinking about similarity.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,210
One way to think
about it is that one

42
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,190
is a scaled-up
version of the other.

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,850
So scaled-up or -down
version of the other.

44
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,400
When we talked about
congruency, they

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
had to be exactly the same.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,260
You could rotate it, you could
shift it, you could flip it.

47
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,760
But when you do all
of those things,

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,840
they would have to
essentially be identical.

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,690
With similarity, you can
rotate it, you can shift it,

50
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,460
you can flip it.

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,980
And you can also scale it up
and down in order for something

52
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,090
to be similar.

53
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:44,310
So for example, let's
say triangle CDE,

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,100
if we know that triangle CDE
is congruent to triangle FGH,

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,450
then we definitely know
that they are similar.

56
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,195
They are scaled up
by a factor of 1.

57
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:57,680
Then we know, for a
fact, that CDE is also

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,740
similar to triangle FGH.

59
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,840
But we can't say it
the other way around.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,350
If triangle ABC
is similar to XYZ,

61
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,430
we can't say that it's
necessarily congruent.

62
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,140
And we see, for this
particular example,

63
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,930
they definitely
are not congruent.

64
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,965
So this is one way to
think about similarity.

65
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:15,590
The other way to
think about similarity

66
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,000
is that all of the corresponding
angles will be equal.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,520
So if something is similar, then
all of the corresponding angles

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,890
are going to be congruent.

69
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,935

70
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,990
I always have trouble
spelling this.

71
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:41,835
It is 2 Rs, 1 S. Corresponding
angles are congruent.

72
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:44,370

73
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,220
So if we say that triangle ABC
is similar to triangle XYZ,

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:58,026
that is equivalent to saying
that angle ABC is congruent--

75
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,650
or we could say that
their measures are

76
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,136
equal-- to angle XYZ.

77
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:05,790

78
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,405
That angle BAC is going to
be congruent to angle YXZ.

79
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:17,950

80
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:24,880
And then finally,
angle ACB is going

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,940
to be congruent to angle XZY.

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,080

83
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,240
So if you have two triangles,
all of their angles

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,490
are the same, then you could
say that they're similar.

85
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,700
Or if you find two
triangles and you're

86
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,474
told that they are
similar triangles,

87
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,640
then you know that all of
their corresponding angles

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,650
are the same.

89
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,170
And the last way
to think about it

90
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,120
is that the sides are all
just scaled-up versions

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,180
of each other.

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,450
So the sides scaled
by the same factor.

93
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,770

94
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,191
In the example we did here,
the scaling factor was 3.

95
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,190
It doesn't have to be 3.

96
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,750
It just has to be the same
scaling factor for every side.

97
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,560
If we scaled this side up by 3
and we only scaled this side up

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,410
by 2, then we would
not be dealing

99
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,110
with a similar triangle.

100
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,230
But if we scaled all
of these sides up by 7,

101
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,730
then that's still a similar,
as long as you have all of them

102
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,240
scaled up or scaled down
by the exact same factor.

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,964
So one way to think
about it is-- I

104
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:30,630
want to still visualize
those triangles.

105
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,010
Let me redraw them right over
here a little bit simpler.

106
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,010
Because I'm not talking
in now in general terms,

107
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,650
not even for that specific case.

108
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:43,600
So if we say that this is A, B,
and C, and this right over here

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,150
is X, Y, and Z. I
just redrew them

110
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,110
so I can refer them
when we write down here.

111
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,665
If we're saying that these
two things right over here

112
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,680
are similar, that means
that corresponding sides

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,530
are scaled-up versions
of each other.

114
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,920
So we could say that
the length of AB

115
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,110
is equal to some
scaling factor--

116
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,640
and this thing could be
less than 1-- some scaling

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,770
factor times the length of
XY, the corresponding sides.

118
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,920
And I know that AB
corresponds to XY because

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,180
of the order in which I wrote
this similarity statement.

120
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,100
So some scaling factor times XY.

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,000
We know that the
length of BC needs

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,455
to be that same scaling
factor times the length of YZ.

123
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:44,270

124
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,140
And then we know
the length of AC

125
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,210
is going to be equal to that
same scaling factor times XZ.

126
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,840
So that's XZ, and this
could be a scaling factor.

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,470
So if ABC is larger
than XYZ, then

128
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,390
these k's will be larger than 1.

129
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,640
If they're the exact same
size, if they're essentially

130
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,630
congruent triangles,
then these k's will be 1.

131
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,420
And if XYZ is bigger
than ABC, then

132
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,361
these [? scaling ?] factors
will be less than 1.

133
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,860
But another way to write these
same statements-- notice, all

134
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,235
I'm saying is
corresponding sides

135
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,150
are scaled-up versions
of each other.

136
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,710
This first statement right here,
if you divide both sides by XY,

137
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:31,720
you get AB over XY is equal
to our scaling factor.

138
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,470
And then the second
statement right

139
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,320
over here, if you divide
both sides by YZ--

140
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,400
let me do it in that
same color-- you

141
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:47,557
get BC divided by YZ is
equal to that scaling factor.

142
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,390
And remember, in the
example we just showed,

143
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,512
that scaling factor was 3.

144
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:54,970
But now we're saying in the
more general terms, similarity,

145
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,370
as long as you have the
same scaling factor.

146
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,280
And then finally, if
you divide both sides

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,210
here by the length between X
and Z, or segment XZ's length,

148
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:11,390
you get AC over XZ is
equal to k, as well.

149
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,620
Or another way to think
about it is the ratio

150
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,980
between corresponding sides.

151
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,990
Notice, this is the
ratio between AB and XY.

152
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:27,460
The ratio between BC and YZ,
the ratio between AC and XZ,

153
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,590
that the ratio between
corresponding sides

154
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,990
all gives us the same constant.

155
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,059
Or you could rewrite
this as AB over XY

156
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:48,050
is equal to BC over YZ is equal
to AC over XZ, which would be

157
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,214
equal to some scaling
factor, which is equal to k.

158
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,630
So if you have
similar triangles--

159
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,580
let me draw an arrow
right over here.

160
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,962
Similar triangles means that
they're scaled-up versions,

161
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,170
and you can also flip and
rotate and do all the stuff

162
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,450
with congruency.

163
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,500
And you can scale
them up or down.

164
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,390
Which means all of the
corresponding angles

165
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,940
are congruent, which
also means that the ratio

166
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,970
between corresponding
sides is going

167
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,580
to be the same constant for
all the corresponding sides.

168
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,360
Or the ratio between
corresponding sides

169
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,942
is constant.

170
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:16,442

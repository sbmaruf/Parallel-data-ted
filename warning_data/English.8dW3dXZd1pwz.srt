1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,170
A single postage
stamp costs $0.44.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,150
How much would a roll
of 1,000 stamps cost?

3
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:09,025
And there's really a
couple of ways to do it.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,450
And I'll do it both ways just
to show you they both work.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,180
One is kind of a
faster way, but I

6
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:15,104
want to make sure you
understand why it works.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,340
And then we'll verify
that it actually gives us

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,920
the right answer using maybe
the more traditional way

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
of multiplying decimals.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,900
So we're starting at $0.44.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,540
I'll just write it as 0.44.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,700
Well, that's one stamp.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,390
So this is 1 stamp.

14
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,010
I'll write it like
this, 1 stamp.

15
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,270
How much would 10 stamps cost?

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,900
Well, if 1 stamp is
$0.44, then 10 stamps,

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,740
we could move the decimal
to the right one place.

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,560
And so it would be--
and now this leading 0

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,040
is not that useful.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,290
So it would now be $4.4.

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,420
Or if you want to make it
clear, it would be $4.40.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,310
Now, what happens if you
want to have 100 stamps?

23
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,250
Well, the same idea
is going to happen.

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,070
We're now taking 10
times more, so we're

25
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,500
going to move the decimal
to the right once.

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,960
So 100 stamps are
going to cost $44.

27
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,422
And this should
make sense for you.

28
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,670
If 1 stamp is 44/100
of $1, then 100 stamps

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,120
are going to be 44/100
of $100, or $44.

30
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:20,544
Or you could view
it as we've just

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,430
moved the decimal
over one place.

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,340
So if we want 1,000 stamps,
we'd move the decimal

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,030
to the right one more time.

34
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,454
Moving the decimal
to the right is

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,330
equivalent to multiplying by 10.

36
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,250
So then it would be $440.

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,670
And we could add another
trailing zero just

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,480
to make clear that there's
no cents over here.

39
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,192
So if you wanted to
do it really quickly,

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,020
you could have
started with $0.44.

41
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,510
And you say look, I'm
not multiplying by 10.

42
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,280
I'm not multiplying by 100.

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,030
I'm multiplying by 1,000.

44
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,260
So you're going to have to
put another trailing zero

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,070
over here.

46
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,750
And you would move the decimal
from over here to over here.

47
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,100
You've essentially
multiplied this times 10

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,720
times 10 times 10,
which is 1,000.

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,150
So then this would become $440.

50
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,710
And let's verify that this works
exactly the same if we multiply

51
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:16,735
it the traditional way, the
way we multiply decimals.

52
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:24,980
So if you have
1,000 times $0.44.

53
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,440
So you start over here.

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,560
4 times 0 is 0.

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
4 times 0 is 0.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,240
4 times 0 is 0.

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,970
4 times 1 is 4.

58
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,840
Or, you could just say,
hey, this was 4 times 1,000.

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,830
Then we're going to
go one place over.

60
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,830
So we're going to add a 0.

61
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,630
And once again, we're going
to have 4 times 0 is 0.

62
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,270
4 times 0 is 0.

63
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,840
4 times 0 is 0.

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,470
4 times 1 is 4.

65
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,740
Or we just did 4 times 1,000.

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,400
So that is 4,000 if you
don't include this 0

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,760
that we added here ahead
of time because we're

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,830
going one place to the left.

69
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,160
And then we have nothing left.

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,020
I haven't at all thought
about the decimals right now.

71
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,980
So far I really just viewed
it as 1,000 times 44.

72
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,180
I've been ignoring the decimal.

73
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,150
So if it was 1,000 times 44,
we would get 0 plus 0 is 0.

74
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,916
0 plus 0 is 0.

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,820
0 plus 0 is 0.

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,500
4 plus 0 is 4.

77
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,860
4 plus nothing is 4.

78
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:19,187
And if you ignore the decimal,
that makes a lot of sense

79
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,040
because 1,000 times 4 is 4,000.

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,290
And 1,000 times 40
would be 40,000.

81
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,100
So you would get 44,000.

82
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,850
But this, of
course, is not a 44.

83
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,490
This is a 44/100.

84
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,930
We have, between the
two numbers, two numbers

85
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,180
behind the decimal point.

86
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
So we need to have
two numbers behind

87
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,260
or to the right of the
decimal point in our answer,

88
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,640
so one, two right over there.

89
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,440
So once again, we get
$440 for the 1,000 stamps.

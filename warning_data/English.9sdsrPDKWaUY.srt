1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,160
Write the prime factorization
of 75.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,390
Write your answer using
exponential notation.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,970
So we have a couple of
interesting things here.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,410
Prime factorization, and they
say exponential notation.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,460
We'll worry about the
exponential notation later.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,560
So the first thing we have to
worry about is what is even a

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,380
prime number?

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,240
And just as a refresher, a
prime number is a number

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,130
that's only divisible by itself
and one, so examples of

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,880
prime numbers-- let me write
some numbers down.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,753
Prime, not prime. Not prime.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,840
So 2 is a prime number.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,850
It's only divisible
by 1 and 2.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,490
3 is another prime number.

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,790
Now, 4 is not prime,
because this is

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,790
divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,580
We could keep going.

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,220
5, well, 5 is only divisible
by 1 and 5, so 5 is prime.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,920
6 is not prime, because it's
divisible by 2 and 3.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,590
I think you get the
general idea.

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,160
You move to 7, 7 is prime.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,470
It's only divisible
by 1 and 7.

23
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,220
8 is not prime.

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,440
9 you might be tempted to say
is prime, but remember, it's

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,420
also divisible by 3,
so 9 is not prime.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,970
Prime is not the same thing
as odd numbers.

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,400
Then if you move to 10,
10 is also not prime,

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,560
divisible by 2 and 5.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,220
11, it's only divisible
by 1 and 11, so 11 is

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,240
then a prime number.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,780
And we could keep going
on like this.

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,570
People have written computer
programs looking for the

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,260
highest prime and all of that.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,220
So now that we know what
a prime is, a prime

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,240
factorization is breaking up
a number, like 75, into a

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,620
product of prime numbers.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,180
So let's try to do that.

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,530
So we're going to start with
75, and I'm going to do it

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,080
using what we call a
factorization tree.

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,750
So we first try to find just the
smallest prime number that

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,890
will go into 75.

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,430
Now, the smallest prime
number is 2.

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,390
Does 2 go into 75?

44
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,705
Well, 75 is an odd number, or
the number in the ones place,

45
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,280
this 5, is an odd number.

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,580
5 is not divisible by 2, so
2 will not go into 75.

47
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,090
So then we could try 3.

48
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,639
Does 3 go into 75?

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,440
Well, 7 plus 5 is 12.

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,480
12 is divisible by 3, so
3 will go into it.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,440
So 75 is 3 times
something else.

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,990
And if you've ever dealt with
change, you know that if you

53
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,890
have three quarters, you have
75 cents, or if you have 3

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,930
times 25, you have 75.

55
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,560
So this is 3 times 25.

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
And you can multiply this out
if you don't believe me.

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,960
Multiple out 3 times 25.

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,470
Now, is 25 divisible by--
you can give up on 2.

59
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,910
If 75 wasn't divisible by 2,
25's not going to be divisible

60
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,000
by 2 either.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,730
But maybe 25 is divisible
by 3 again.

62
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,290
So if you take the digits
2 plus 5, you get 7.

63
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,700
7 is not divisible by 3, so 25
will not be divisible by 3.

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,480
So we keep moving up: 5.

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,430
Is 25 divisible by 5?

66
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,980
Well, sure.

67
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,590
It's 5 times 5.

68
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,330
So 25 is 5 times 5.

69
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,730
And we're done with our prime
factorization because now we

70
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,390
have all prime numbers here.

71
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,270
So we can write that 75
is 3 times 5 times 5.

72
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:25,640
So 75 is equal to 3
times 5 times 5.

73
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,350
We can say it's 3 times 25.

74
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,400
25 is 5 times 5.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,370
3 times 25, 25 is 5 times 5.

76
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,460
So this is a prime
factorization, but they want

77
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,690
us to write our answer using
exponential notation.

78
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,560
So that just means, if we have
repeated primes, we can write

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
those as an exponent.

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,480
So what is 5 times 5?

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,380
5 times 5 is 5 multiplied
by itself two times.

82
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,310
This is the same thing as
5 to the second power.

83
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,380
So if we want to write our
answer using exponential

84
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,420
notation, we could say this is
equal to 3 times 5 to the

85
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,110
second power, which is the
same thing as 5 times 5.

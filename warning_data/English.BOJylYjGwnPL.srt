<i> FInal Episode

2
00:00:53,574 --> 00:01:00,007
Abracadabra...Goo Jun Pyo, remember Geum Jan Di, remember Geum Jan Di...

3
00:01:00,007 --> 00:02:07,392
Abracadabra, abracadabra..!!

4
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:09,543
Ohhh!! You scared mee!

5
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:11,396
You little brat!! What the hell are you doing here??

6
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:14,397
i also think that,I think you've been under a lot of stress lately.

7
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:22,247
You're getting a zit on that good-looking face of yours.

8
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,115
What is this?

9
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:27,088
Can't you see, it's a lunchbox.

10
00:02:27,088 --> 00:03:11,592
Lunchbox?

11
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:17,783
Is it good??

12
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:19,943
This...

13
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:23,344
- You made this? <BR>- What??

14
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:30,801
Yeah...if it's good, I'll bring it again next time.!

15
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:40,449
You must be thirsty. Do you want me to go get you some water?

16
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,051
I remember.!

17
00:03:45,051 --> 00:04:04,778
The person that I forgot.. is you, right?

18
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:10,971
Here you go. Thank you. Come back again.

19
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,002
Welco ...

20
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,349
- One order of abalone porridge.- And one order of pumpkin porridge.

21
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:17,308
Sunbae...

22
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,562
What brings you guys here?

23
00:04:19,562 --> 00:05:09,482
Can't you see? We came to eat porridge.

24
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:13,531
- Ahh, I'm so full. <BR>- Me too.

25
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:17,485
Now tell us, is there something wrong?

26
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:24,372
For Geum JanDi who can't even take care of her boyfriend because of her job...we brought some news.

27
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,169
Huh?

28
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,517
JunPyo finally got discharged.

29
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:30,119
R..Really?

30
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:34,351
How can you guys say something so important after you're done eating?

31
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:44,517
Hurry up and go.

32
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:55,459
I'll be back.

33
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:28,502
Sunbae, you're not going? No. I came here because of you.

34
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:42,875
They look happy...the pottery that's in there. Instead of suffering from the heat, they rather look happy.

35
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,097
Why?

36
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:52,732
Because if they endure it, once they come out, they will be loved...they hold that hope.

37
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:57,577
That's so like Gaeul.

38
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:04,544
You can tell me now. I'm ready.

39
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:09,023
You have something to say, right?

40
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:17,338
Would you like the bad news first again?

41
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:20,438
I'm ...

42
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:24,512
....leaving.

43
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:32,253
If you think about it, that might not be such bad news for you.

44
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,223
Where to? Sweden.

45
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:41,959
When....no - or how long?- Soon

46
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,079
Probably about four to five years.

47
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:57,912
That's great. You'll be an even greater potter.

48
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:10,324
If you think about it, this can also be good news...so what's the other news?

49
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,493
When I come back....

50
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:17,799
....you'll be the first one I look for.

51
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,634
Sunbae...

52
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:32,078
I mean, that's only if by that time, you still haven't found your soulmate.

53
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:55,338
Put more firewood! The pottery has to be 1300 degrees C!

54
00:08:55,338 --> 00:09:01,972
Goo JunPyo, congrats on your discharge.....Oh, it's JanDi Unnie. Hi, JanDi Unnie!

55
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:06,035
Oh, hi. Yumi, you're here, too.

56
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:10,749
What are you doing here? JiHoo is not here.

57
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:15,033
I heard that you were discharged. Just wanted to say congrats.

58
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,852
How nosy you are!

59
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:22,443
Why don't you just take care of your own boyfriend. Does JiHoo know that you're going around like this?

60
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:25,591
- Hey, watch what you say.- What?

61
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:34,375
JiHoo Sunbae has no reason to hear such things from you. Then why don't you behave so it's not so embarrassing.

62
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:40,781
Fine. I shouldn't have come. You just take care of youself.

63
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,007
What's wrong with you, Oppa. You're so mean.

64
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:54,395
Unnie, don't go. Tea's coming. Oppa's tea is really good. Have some tea.

65
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:59,102
Tea is ready. Bring it here, please.

66
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:15,915
Unnie, come sit over here.

67
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:21,322
Oh, it looks so good.

68
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:29,463
Ah!I'll do it myself

69
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:44,013
Is it good?I spilled it all over.

70
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:48,406
You should try it.

71
00:10:48,406 --> 00:11:04,236
Mmmm, tastes good.

72
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:07,475
I'm leaving

73
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:10,323
You...

74
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:16,357
don't come back again.

75
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:22,809
Whenever I see you, my mood turns sour. You get on my nerves.

76
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:41,356
I get it. I'm sorry. I won't come back again!

77
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:45,353
Unni!

78
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:53,007
The person that JunPyo oppa has to remember, is that you, by any chance?

79
00:11:53,007 --> 00:12:05,197
I'm right. But as you can see, seeing you isn't good for him. Whenever he sees you, his condition worsens.

80
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:11,024
So, from the moment on, it's best if you don't come here anymore.

81
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:40,075
But don't worry. Every chance I get, I'll work really hard to try and get him to remember you. Take care, then.

82
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:43,079
- Make me that. <BR>- What?

83
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,289
- That lunchbox that you made last time.<BR>- Lunchbox?

84
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:53,322
The rolled eggs that you made for me at the hospital. Make that for me again.

85
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,981
Ahhh, that. Okay, oppa.

86
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:17,005
But there are so many more tasty foods to eat here. Why do you want to eat that?

87
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:22,372
I'm sorry.

88
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:28,328
-Sunbae? <BR> -Don't escape.

89
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:31,219
- Let me go. <BR>- No!

90
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:57,069
You can't back off now.

91
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:04,716
Jandi!

92
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:08,243
It's all over now. It's useless now

93
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:16,525
You see, I believed that even though he lost his memory, even if we had to start all over again, that he'd recognize me.

94
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,606
But, the fact is I was wrong.

95
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:23,445
-That's not it. <BR> -No.

96
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:28,365
I may be upset and feel cheated, but I have to accept it.

97
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:35,082
The Goo Joonpyo that I liked, the Goo Joonpyo who loved me, doesn't exist anymore.

98
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:40,817
I told you, you can't become like the little mermaid

99
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:47,296
I refuse to accept that you, two will break up over something as nonsensical as this.

100
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:51,001
i can't accept it

101
00:14:51,001 --> 00:15:00,879
It's not because of Yumi.

102
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,593
Ultimately, Goo Joonpyo and Geum Jandi...

103
00:15:07,593 --> 00:16:03,155
It's the end for us

104
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:20,919
Eat it all

105
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:29,121
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

106
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,968
-This isn't it. <BR>-Huh?

107
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:35,782
This isn't the same flavor as before.

108
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:40,667
Did you really make that other one?

109
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,623
Uh, of course. Of course I made it. Who else would have?

110
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:48,028
It's just that each time you make it, it tastes a little different.

111
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:55,374
Next time, I'll make it just right.

112
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:58,617
Is there something making you feel bad?

113
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:05,841
That girl...

114
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:15,488
Jandi or Japcho ("lawn" or "weed"), that girl's expression...

115
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:17,398
I can't erase it from my mind.

116
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:19,512
You're too much.

117
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:26,225
How could you? From the time you were in the hospital until now, I was the one who has been at your side.

118
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:32,138
But that un-nee who pops up every now and then to irritate you, she gets stuck in your mind?

119
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:39,399
Your friends treat me like crap and always take that un-nee's side.

120
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:45,384
And that un-nee's boyfriend treats me as though I have some disease, completely ignoring me.

121
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:52,625
But, for you...because I was worried about you, I put up with it all...

122
00:17:52,625 --> 00:18:07,402
But, if you act like this too, then what am I supposed to do?

123
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:34,734
Hey!

124
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:47,701
What's the matter?

125
00:18:47,701 --> 00:20:45,166
<i>Invitation: "Surprise pool party thrown by Goo Joonpyo and Chang Yumi"

126
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:51,043
Un-nee, you came!

127
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:55,857
- Have you been well?<BR>- I'm glad you came, I have something to report to you.

128
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,425
Report....?

129
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:02,448
Oppa still can't remember you.

130
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:06,852
- Is that so?<BR>- And one other thing...

131
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:12,925
I'm sorry for you, but I like Joonpyo oppa.

132
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:13,998
What?

133
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:22,005
It's not that I did it on purpose; it just happened. I like him so much that I can't part from him.

134
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:29,095
Oppa feels the same way as I do. Sorry. I know you'll understand, right?

135
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:37,543
A person's heart can't be controlled the way we want...

136
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:41,836
Oh, look at the time...

137
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:46,747
I need to tell everyone the reason for this party.

138
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:47,865
Reason?

139
00:21:47,865 --> 00:22:22,169
Un-nee, come over in a little bit.

140
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:25,591
Don't collapse now.

141
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,098
Let's go

142
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:32,002
hear what they have to say.

143
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:38,304
We invited you all here because we have a special announcement to make.

144
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:45,862
Goo Joonpyo and Jang Yumi, we have decided to study in America next month.

145
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:47,299
What?

146
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,092
What is that girl talking about?

147
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:50,459
Study abroad?

148
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:56,755
I'm going to continue my studies and oppa will carry on with his business.

149
00:22:56,755 --> 00:23:05,689
Don't feel too sad while we're gone, and be happy until we meet again.

150
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:10,093
That girl is something else.

151
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:16,053
It's a shock to get hit in the back of the head like this.

152
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:43,084
Let's go.

153
00:23:43,084 --> 00:24:27,766
I'll get you a glass of warm water.

154
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:36,804
Goo JoonPyo!

155
00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:39,494
Do you remember this?

156
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:42,185
What is it?

157
00:24:42,185 --> 00:25:00,827
You don't remember the names on this?

158
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,814
JJ

159
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:07,184
How would I know something like this?

160
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:09,613
I'll return it. Take it back.

161
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:12,174
Why would I take something like this?

162
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:17,811
If you want to get rid of it, throw it away yourself.

163
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:40,938
Yeah.

164
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:49,241
Goo JoonPyo. I'll ask just once more, just one more question.

165
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,328
What now?

166
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:52,246
Do you know how to swim?

167
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:54,681
Swim?

168
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,098
I don't swim.

169
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,705
Don't swim or can't swim?

170
00:25:57,705 --> 00:26:02,051
Because of a bad experience when I was a kid, I don't swim. I've never done it.

171
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:09,042
No. You do know how to swim

172
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:14,572
What are you? Who do you think you are to blab off about me.

173
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:21,842
You don't fear anything in the world, but you're so scared of bugs, you shake.

174
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:30,097
You the idiot who would rather his ribs all bust apart than see one finger on his woman hurt.

175
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:42,322
You're the idiot who doesn't know the difference between "privacy" and "pride" who insists that the 38th parallel are train tracks.

176
00:26:42,322 --> 00:26:47,868
You freak out when it comes to kids, but...

177
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:52,693
you want to be a devoted father...

178
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:57,761
who will go out and look at the stars with his son.

179
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:01,052
You're a lonely but loving guy.

180
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,031
Who do you think you are?

181
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:04,761
That's who you are, Goo Joonpyo.

182
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:08,132
I'm asking who you are?

183
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,735
You call it out.

184
00:27:10,735 --> 00:29:17,951
My name.

185
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:21,094
Geum JanDi.

186
00:29:21,094 --> 00:30:05,831
JanDi yah!!

187
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:27,028
Geum JanDi...wake up!

188
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:43,203
JanDi....Geum JanDi!!

189
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:51,905
Are you all right?

190
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:54,273
Do you remember now?

191
00:30:54,273 --> 00:31:00,653
Geum JanDi...you scare me like that one more time and you're dead!

192
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:05,014
You remember....

193
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,827
I'm sorry...

194
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:13,238
I'm sorry...

195
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:19,873
Say it again....my name.

196
00:31:19,873 --> 00:32:04,317
Jan Di...

197
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:10,223
It seems like just yesterday that our Jandi started high school, yet it's already graduation.

198
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:16,914
I'm sorry mom that I can't get a job or go to college like others do.

199
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:22,849
Noona, you don't have to take a test to go to Shinhwa University, isn't it the same for medical school?

200
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:26,596
If I want to get a scholarship, I have to take the test.

201
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:33,093
No, your life has been full of obstacles, now, I want you to do what you want to do.

202
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:37,467
And by the way, what are you wearing to the graduation?

203
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,582
I'm not going...

204
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,267
Why would I....

205
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:46,774
Aren't you a graduate of ShinHwa? Why wouldn't you go?

206
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:55,522
Please don't concern yourself.

207
00:32:55,522 --> 00:33:18,005
Come out to the front of your house.

208
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,061
Congratulations on your graduation.

209
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:24,622
Thanks!

210
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:28,419
Do you really need to go to medical school?

211
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,151
Why? What are you about to say?

212
00:33:31,151 --> 00:33:34,357
There's no guarantee that studying for another year is going to help.

213
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:35,232
And?

214
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,489
If any,

215
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:39,216
think about it...a doctor like you?

216
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:41,292
You'd probably cut them up.

217
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,229
What?

218
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:47,635
Even without a scalpel (surgical knife) you cut people up.

219
00:33:47,635 --> 00:33:59,146
You...didn't really come to congratulate me on my graduation, did you? You came to make fun of me, right?

220
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,414
Ah, hey!

221
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:12,259
Hey, Geum Jandi, tomorrow, you...

222
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,994
Got it?

223
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:20,529
If you're late again this time, you're dead!

224
00:34:20,529 --> 00:35:12,954
Go on in and sleep.

225
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:53,494
It's F4!!

226
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:55,896
Grandpa!

227
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:57,999
I'll throw the garbage out and then get your tea

228
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:03,504
Oh, okay.

229
00:36:03,504 --> 00:37:03,797
That little rascal...

230
00:37:03,797 --> 00:37:17,778
Came already!

231
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:21,348
Geum Jandi! Why did you come this late?

232
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:22,783
Oh, well, I...

233
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:29,757
You weren't planning to just skip this last event, were you?

234
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:33,526
We're not even high schoolers, so why do you think we're here?

235
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:34,928
Huh?

236
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:43,237
The great F4 have been waiting all day to dance with Geum Jandi.

237
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:50,143
Miss Jandi, would you do me the great honor of dancing with me?

238
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,879
- With me? <BR>- Let's go.

239
00:37:52,879 --> 00:38:23,759
No, just a minute...

240
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:30,035
Woobin sunbae, who was the backbone and support of F4...

241
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:36,069
I know that you are always one step behind, offering your heart in support...

242
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:54,274
I know that now.

243
00:38:54,274 --> 00:39:00,346
Although you act cold and mean...in reality, you are warmer and more pure than others.

244
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:16,296
Thanks to you, I think that Gaeul has experienced a beautiful love.

245
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:19,975
Don't you think it's time to give others a turn?

246
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:27,441
Rascal...

247
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:30,031
What can I do since my clothes are like this?

248
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:32,946
<BR> It's perfect.

249
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:35,452
Geum JanDi's combat uniform

250
00:39:35,452 --> 00:40:09,605
Don't you think it's the perfect outfit for Geum Jandi to finish her high school life?

251
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:14,411
As if having falling into a wonderland like Alice....

252
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:21,598
It will go to the emergency bell, the possibility which it will meet you there is a fact. .<br/> Do you knowhow comforting it is... Sunbae?

253
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:26,924
You're like someone sent from the heaven to me like bonus....

254
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,507
I'll never be able to forget you...

255
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:34,839
My soulmate...JiHoo Sunbae....

256
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:42,127
Thank you.

257
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,034
What happened to JunPyo??

258
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:52,576
His phone is off. Do you think something's happened?

259
00:40:52,576 --> 00:41:00,727
You....tomorrow.....

260
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:05,063
All right?

261
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:10,131
Saturday. 4 pm. Front of NamSan Tower.

262
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:15,956
I...have to...leave first....You're crazy until the end.

263
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:50,654
Geum JanDi!

264
00:41:50,654 --> 00:41:57,464
Didn't I say that if you were late, you'd be dead?

265
00:41:57,464 --> 00:42:34,062
You're even late on a day like this...You always just do whatever you want.

266
00:42:34,062 --> 00:42:38,137
It's not some kind of magic. This kind of thing...

267
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:42,272
It's easy ..

268
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:48,022
Compared to grassland management

269
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:59,401
Come here

270
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:09,566
It's a coffee that costs $36.3. Drink it up!

271
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:19,123
Let's go.

272
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:23,094
It's been a long time since we've been here huh?

273
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:26,699
Is it open??

274
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:34,017
Why don't I see anyone here??

275
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:36,599
I rented it. What?

276
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:48,972
I basically bought it until the morning. And I also have something to show you.

277
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:52,586
Come here.I told you there's something I want to show you!

278
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:58,699
What's wrong with you...there's something I want to show you...

279
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:04,393
You...do you already know?

280
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:08,582
You...do you intend to make it so that I can't get married?

281
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:13,641
You just need to marry me. Who were you going to marry???

282
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:18,761
Move. Just move aside.

283
00:44:18,761 --> 00:44:20,067
Goo Jun Pyo loves Geum Jan Di <br/> Our first night together!!! <3

284
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:23,437
It's still here!!

285
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:30,313
Now you can not get married.

286
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:33,442
Geum Jan Di.

287
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:37,595
Listen carefully to what I have to say...

288
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:41,304
So ominous... W-...W-...What is it now???

289
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:47,626
Us......

290
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:50,882
Let's get married...

291
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,635
Married?

292
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:58,441
Yes, married.

293
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:01,818
Why are you suddenly joking around like that??

294
00:45:01,818 --> 00:45:07,009
I'm not joking

295
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:13,435
I've just barely graduated from high school.

296
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:15,925
I....

297
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:19,429
...have to go to the U.S.

298
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:20,619
U.S?

299
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:23,884
This time, it's not because of my mom.....

300
00:45:23,884 --> 00:45:26,097
...and not because of the business...

301
00:45:26,097 --> 00:45:43,453
It was my decision.

302
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:49,051
Killing off a living dad...forcing an offspring to marry...

303
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:54,564
or having to lobby all the time. I don't want that kind of corporation.

304
00:45:54,564 --> 00:45:57,003
I'm....

305
00:45:57,003 --> 00:46:01,396
...going to try my best.

306
00:46:01,396 --> 00:46:06,647
So...if I can save the corporation then that's great...

307
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:10,217
but if I can't...

308
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:16,019
then I'll shut it down with my own hands.

309
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:18,429
How long will it take?

310
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:21,524
......4 years.

311
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:25,402
At least it will be 4 years...

312
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:33,536
For that long??...

313
00:46:33,536 --> 00:46:51,054
So.....come with me then.

314
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:59,995
I can't..

315
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:02,298
What???

316
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:06,636
Why can't you??

317
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:14,077
When you went to Macau.....

318
00:47:14,077 --> 00:47:18,147
....I made a decision, too..

319
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:23,786
About my dreams and my futuree..

320
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:29,826
What is it that I want and what is it that I want to do.

321
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,462
Like you.....

322
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:40,077
...the thing that I want to try my best at ,and do my best...is right here...

323
00:47:40,077 --> 00:47:45,274
So???

324
00:47:45,274 --> 00:47:47,041
Have a good trip....

325
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:50,513
Whatt??

326
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:55,117
I said, "Have a good trip."

327
00:47:55,117 --> 00:48:07,003
4 years later, if you come back as a great man, I will think about it again then..

328
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:08,765
Geum Jan Di.

329
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:13,202
Are you serious

330
00:48:13,202 --> 00:48:19,409
You are going to regret for letting me go

331
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:28,361
Hey, you are the one who is going to regret it!

332
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:35,625
Alright, you win

333
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:39,929
I already know...

334
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:50,139
that I would regret until I die for letting you go

335
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:52,842
Goo Joon Pyo

336
00:48:52,842 --> 00:49:00,316
You might not be as stupid as you look

337
00:49:00,316 --> 00:50:02,291
You wanna die?

338
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:24,025
4 years later

339
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:32,567
<i>Shinhwa group's managing Director, Goo JunPyo covers 3 international economic magazines.

340
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:37,053
Today, we have Goo JunPyo, the executive director of ShinHwa Group who succeed in establishing a strategic alliance with the Global Soft Inc. this month

341
00:50:37,053 --> 00:50:44,195
which has been internationally recognized and brought Korea into the spotlight.

342
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:46,096
Thank you for coming on our show.Hello.

343
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:52,786
I heard not too long ago that you are the first Korean to be on the cover of 3 international economic magazines.

344
00:50:52,786 --> 00:51:18,803
Congratulations.-Thank you.

345
00:51:18,803 --> 00:51:29,388
We'll change the topic a little bit now. The viewers, especially the women in Korea, would like to hear some personal information.

346
00:51:29,388 --> 00:51:34,111
Of course, you're managing an international company, but you're also in the prime of your 20s

347
00:51:34,111 --> 00:51:40,354
So I'm sure you're lonely sometimes. How do you overcome that?

348
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:46,284
Dating or love. It seems like you're curious about these aspects of my life.

349
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:50,177
You certainly have a faster understanding of things than others.

350
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:56,446
Yes. Well, to say I wasn't lonely or had it hard is probably a lie.

351
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:04,413
But because of a promise I made with someone, I was able to rely on that and endure it.

352
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:10,552
Just watching you talk about it. It shows that you have someone special in your heart.

353
00:52:10,552 --> 00:52:12,041
yes...well

354
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:16,043
A lover? Lately, there's been a lot of rumors about your marriage.

355
00:52:16,043 --> 00:53:27,059
Since you're already here. How about you tell us a little about who she is?

356
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:31,192
Is that a grape?-Yes

357
00:53:31,192 --> 00:53:37,401
You're still putting too much pressure in your hands.

358
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:39,824
YiJung Sunbae...

359
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:43,914
Hi

360
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:50,867
Who is he? Is he teacher's boyfriend?Mister did you just come back from another country ?

361
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:52,988
Oh, how did you know?

362
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:55,904
Then, did you just come back from Sweden?

363
00:53:55,904 --> 00:53:58,763
Little miss, you're really amazing.

364
00:53:58,763 --> 00:54:08,026
Then you're him! Our teacher said her boyfriend was there.

365
00:54:08,026 --> 00:54:34,034
You can't tell him that!

366
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:39,581
Hey wait! Wait! Wait!

367
00:54:39,581 --> 00:54:42,428
Thank you!

368
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:50,004
Hey, third repeater. Are you late even on a day like today?Not a day goes by that you don't cause trouble..

369
00:54:50,004 --> 00:55:02,594
I'm sorry, Sunbae-nim. I'm sorry.

370
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:11,816
Do you think it'll end like that?

371
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:39,625
Sunbae!

372
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:40,864
Hey, Geum JanDi! -Yes.

373
00:55:40,864 --> 00:55:42,628
Can't you do this properly?

374
00:55:42,628 --> 00:55:43,495
What is this?

375
00:55:43,495 --> 00:56:16,228
I'm sorry. Do it again. Hurry!-I'm sorry Sunbae-nim..

376
00:56:16,228 --> 00:56:26,972
You came?

377
00:56:26,972 --> 00:56:32,116
By the look on your face, looks like you made another mistake.

378
00:56:32,116 --> 00:56:36,374
Sunbae, since you entered on time, you're already in the graduating class…

379
00:56:36,374 --> 00:56:44,255
When am I, a third-year ever going to finish and in what millennium will I become a doctor?

380
00:56:44,255 --> 00:56:48,727
The future sure looks dark.You're not worried about flunking?

381
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:53,537
Sunbae!

382
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:58,552
It's because of you that I've lasted this long as an outcast.

383
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:04,109
When I think about what I'm going to do when you go to the hospital, it looks dark..

384
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:07,564
Then, should I repeat too?

385
00:57:07,564 --> 00:57:12,251
Aigoo, that's all right.That's scarier than a flunking joke.

386
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:16,021
It's not a joke.

387
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:22,454
Sunbae, you have to hurry and become a doctor so you can reopen your grandfather's clinic..

388
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:29,194
That's why you went back and studied..That wasn't the only reason.

389
00:57:29,194 --> 00:57:31,087
What?

390
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:38,076
Doctor prince, my throat hurts.

391
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:41,058
Doctor prince?

392
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:51,223
SaeByul is going to grow up and marry Doctor Prince later in the future.

393
00:57:51,223 --> 00:58:02,968
We'll get married next time. Right now, say ‘ah'.

394
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:09,007
Commoner, can you hear me? Geum JanDi respond.

395
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:35,167
Are you there Geum JanDi? If you're there, come meet me on the beach. Goo JoonPyo?.

396
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:48,847
Goo Joon Pyo?

397
00:58:48,847 --> 00:59:05,023
You took 5 minutes! Can't you walk faster?!

398
00:59:05,023 --> 00:59:09,601
Goo JoonPyo.

399
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:11,027
What's going on?

400
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:18,243
What do you mean?Goo JoonPyo has come back for Geum JanDi.

401
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:27,419
Seeing you wearing this white gown, I guess ugly ducklings can become swans after all.

402
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:31,957
It's Goo JoonPyo.

403
00:59:31,957 --> 00:59:44,503
You're really Goo JoonPyo.

404
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:50,742
I missed you.Enough to die.

405
00:59:50,742 --> 01:00:02,027
I'm not going to let you go again.

406
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:08,001
You promised, didn't you? When I returned, you'd take responsibility for me.

407
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:11,588
Look here, Mr. Goo JoonPyo with a bad memory.

408
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:20,906
I said when you returned in four years, I would think about it. I never said I would take responsibility.

409
01:00:20,906 --> 01:00:24,074
Your memory is bad too, but you remember that well.

410
01:00:24,074 --> 01:00:27,562
In my memory, there was another condition.

411
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:28,777
What?

412
01:00:28,777 --> 01:00:33,992
The one about if you come back as a really amazing man.

413
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:58,478
Can you really say that in front of the great Goo JunPyo?

414
01:00:58,478 --> 01:01:00,899
Geum JanDi...

415
01:01:00,899 --> 01:01:13,551
Please marry this great Goo JunPyo.

416
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:16,319
I object to that proposal!

417
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,062
I also object!

418
01:01:19,062 --> 99:59:59,999
Me too!You guys can't do that so easily without our permission.

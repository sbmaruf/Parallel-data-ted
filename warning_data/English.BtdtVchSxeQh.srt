00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,300
Hello everyone, my name is Rui Hui, I’m 30 years old, and I’m still single.

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:42,370
The purpose of me shooting this video, is to find two girls from my past, two girls.

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,020
First, let’s talk about our first encounter, the first and only encounter,

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,300
that was when we were in high school, which named S.M.K Bo Gui.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,770
That year was my Form 3 in High School.

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,040
As usual Dad used to fetch me to school around 7 in the morning.

7
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,100
I remember that day, he was rushing off to Penang, so I had to go to school early..

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,660
And then…

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,620
Boy, we’re here.

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,140
Boy, get up. We're here.

11
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,260
Boy, wake up. Hey!

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,100
Dad, can we not be this early next time?

13
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,340
I’m not awake yet…

14
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,040
Then go continue sleeping in class!

15
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,000
It’s so early, there’s no one there…

16
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
That’s good! No one will disturb you…

17
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,120
Kid, here so early?

18
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,260
Dating?

19
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,230
Can you handle it?

20
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
Stop annoying me!

21
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,740
Excuse me, can you please accompany us to get something from the classroom?

22
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,960
It’s too dark, we dare not go…

23
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,280
It’s all your fault for not bringing it.
Now we have to go back to get it.

24
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,320
Oh… Where is your classroom?

25
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,400
What is it that you’re trying to get?

26
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Why not wait till when class starts?

27
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,900
She needs it now…

28
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,640
Aiya, girl stuff, you won’t understand!

29
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
Oh, girl stuff?

30
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,800
Just started using, can’t predict it correctly, it’s normal!

31
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,180
Don’t be nervous, these things, I usually……

32
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,420
You use it?!

33
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,180
Impossible... Usually, I see my mom buy them in the supermarket..

34
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,860
My mom’s one can fly.. How about you guys?

35
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,060
Fly?

36
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,040
It can fly if it has wings!

37
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,440
We’re here. Which floor is your classroom at?

38
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,820
At the top floor…

39
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,660
Which is your classroom?

40
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,230
The last one…

41
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,720
It’s really dark…

42
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,370
Now what?

43
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,300
We’re here now… Just get it fast so we can leave fast!

44
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,760
You lead the way.

45
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,620
Stay close to me.

46
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,230
We… We…

47
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,600
We’re here.

48
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,800
It’s so dark, turn on the lights…

49
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,530
The switches are inside. What are you  waiting for?

50
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,440
Why don’t we go in together…

51
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,680
Are you scared? But you’re a guy…

52
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,690
I’m not scared, it’s just that, I’m worried that if I leave the two of you out here,

53
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,560
and then... suddenly...

54
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,320
Stop talking, we’ll go in together…

55
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,290
What’s that noise? Who’s flicking pages?

56
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,880
Where are the switches?

57
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,740
Hey, where are the switches?

58
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,850
Behind you!

59
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,440
Oh Thanks!

60
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,000
Everything after that, doesn’t ring a bell to me…

61
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,470
Then, I never saw them again.

62
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,700
So, with this video, I hope I can find them again.

63
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,360
Because I really want to know…

64
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,340
Where exactly...

65
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,280
...were the lights switch?

66
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,660
If you have any news about these two girls, or if you are them…

67
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,200
Please call this number. Thank you…

68
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,160
I haven’t even posted it…

69
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,520
Kid, here so early?

70
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,120
Dating?

71
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,820
That day, everyone was busy with the general election.

72
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,280
So no one could hear her scream.

73
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,500
I was not, of course, the first to discover her.

74
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,500
A security guard found the corpse.

75
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,760
Meanwhile, I was half-awake,

76
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,680
Waiting quietly for the arrival of dawn.

77
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,660
Chen Xiao Hui?

78
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,300
What are you doing here?

79
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,120
Why are you crying?

80
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,580
I don’t know.

81
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,620
Do you want to come in?

82
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,310
Hold on a sec.

83
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,870
Hello? Teacher Lim?

84
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,260
Chen Xiao Hui? That’s impossible.

85
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,600
She’s with me right now.

86
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,080
Teacher Lim called to tell me that

87
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,540
Chen Xiao Hui from my school is dead.

88
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,300
In fact, she was already dead for many days.

89
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,860
Her face…

90
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,420
Her face…

91
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,140
Ever since I started writing this

92
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,020
I often dream of her drowned corpse.

93
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,260
But I can’t see her face.

94
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,920
What are you doing?

95
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,440
You’re so sweaty!

96
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,860
How was school?

97
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,840
I played hide-and-seek

98
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,120
Hide-and-seek?

99
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,420
You weren’t studying?

100
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,680
I was!

101
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Hey, look who’s here?

102
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,260
Uncle Wai Loon.

103
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,320
You’re early today.

104
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Teng, go watch TV, okay?

105
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,020
Okay.

106
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,160
You still write everything by hand?

107
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,200
I’m retro.

108
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I know. Look at this place.

109
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,680
You’re writing about that incident?

110
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,940
I have to give readers what they want.

111
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,080
It’s still fiction, I dramatized many things.

112
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,880
Besides, it’s already been so many years. 
No one will remember.

113
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,410
Can you even remember our high school lives?

114
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,140
Of course I do.

115
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
You were the fiercest school prefect around.

116
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,740
Always yelling at us to keep quiet.

117
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,340
Answer your phone, school prefect.

118
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,760
It’s my wife.

119
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,160
Keep quiet eh?

120
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,100
Hi, honey. What’s up?

121
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,120
Yeah, I’m outside now. Meeting a client.

122
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,470
Tonight? I can’t. How about tomorrow?

123
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,080
All right, see you later.

124
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,840
You don’t need to work that hard.

125
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,680
I can look after you and Teng.

126
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,740
Besides, most people in our country don’t read much anymore.

127
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,860
They’re so uncultured.

128
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,340
Grains of sand,

129
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,880
glittering like crystal,

130
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,160
have lodged themselves between her lips.

131
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,400
Accompanying her in death.

132
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,320
This was the last time I met Xiao Hui.

133
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,860
Do you know?

134
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,280
If you look at the sun from underneath the water

135
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,020
It is as if the sun if floating.

136
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,560
It’s a lovely sight.

137
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,780
But sad at the same time.

138
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,880
This was what Xiao Hui saw.

139
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,520
And then…

140
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,580
Was she your friend?

141
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,380
The dead girl.

142
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,640
Ever since I found her,

143
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,900
I came here everyday all the time.

144
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,300
Sometimes, it was real.

145
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,340
Sometimes, it was a dream.

146
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,160
It’s not day or night.

147
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,400
But it is always this river.

148
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,960
That morning when we met

149
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,480
She was crying.

150
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,980
I really wanted to know why.

151
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,180
I still see the girl, you know? At this place.

152
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,980
Where?

153
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,100
Come with me.

154
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,550
Teng! Where are you?

155
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,940
Teng!

156
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,000
Teng!

157
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,000
Teng!

158
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,780
Are you hiding? This isn’t funny anymore.

159
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,960
Teng!

160
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Teng! Please come out!

161
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,370
I don’t want to be alone.

162
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,080
You can’t leave me too.

163
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,160
Teng!

164
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,890
Oh my god, where did you go?

165
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,380
Papa! Papa!

166
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,870
It’s okay.

167
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,540
Hey lady, is anything wrong?

168
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,700
Mama.

169
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,620
Shh… don’t be afraid.

170
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,120
Hey, wait a minute.

171
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,860
Aren’t you Fiona Wong?

172
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,310
It’s me, Wai Loon!

173
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,360
Wow! I haven’t seen you since high school!

174
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,880
We were in the same class, remember?

175
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,660
Mommy! Mommy!

176
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,500
Open the door, mommy.

177
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,860
Open the door, mommy.

178
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,500
Open the door, mommy.

179
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,620
Teng…

180
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,340
Teng!

181
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,080
I’m sorry, Teng.

182
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,600
I’m so sorry.

183
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,980
Good girl.

184
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,310
Tell papa that lunch is ready.

185
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,260
Papa, lunchtime!

186
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,510
Lunch is ready, papa!

187
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,310
Okay! Let’s go!

188
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,800
Teng, eat more, okay?

189
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,620
Where did you buy this? It’s delicious!

190
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,080
I cooked them myself.

191
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,470
But don’t you have to buy them before you cook them?

192
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,790
We went grocery shopping together, remember?

193
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,320
You have improved.

194
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,330
Way better than when we first met

195
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,440
You paid for my cooking classes.

196
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,440
Glad you know. It’s already been 8 years.

197
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,660
Now the marriage is worth it!

198
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,860
You’re so mean!

199
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,330
You said you’ll always love me, Wai Loon.

200
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,380
Teng.

201
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,040
Let’s go home with mommy, okay?

202
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,880
Mommy will buy you a doll.

203
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,600
Teng.

204
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,900
Why are you ignoring me?

205
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,240
I’m not dead!

206
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,360
If I look like this again…

207
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,800
Will you still love me?

208
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,780
Chen Xiao Hui.

209
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,660
You’re the only one I have now.

210
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,550
Don't worry.

211
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,380
it's quite common we encounter such incidents in our work.

212
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,000
Have you called the company?

213
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,660
What are you waiting for?

214
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,800
Ah Tuck, I....

215
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,750
Give me!

216
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,340
Tuck, we've got some problem.

217
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,540
Our actress Candy was possesesed during filming.

218
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,320
You just contact Master Wong to meet us when we reach the office.

219
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
It'll take us about an hour to reach the office.

220
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,180
Rush, rush, rush...

221
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,540
Haven't even checked the location properly and they start filming...

222
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,760
Now we're in deep shit.

223
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,200
Fuck!

224
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,780
I thought we still have some scenes to complete...

225
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,980
...where are we going?

226
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,690
Candy, are you alright?

227
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,980
What happened?

228
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Nothing happened...

229
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,760
We wrapped early tonight!

230
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,180
So we're heading back to the office.

231
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,560
If you don't feel well, just take a nap.

232
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,050
When we reached we'll wake you up.

233
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,480
Shit, her make up is scary enough.

234
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,760
Don't worry, everything will be alright.

235
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,540
Go pick her up.

236
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,420
Pick her up.

237
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,500
What are you afraid of?

238
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,280
We can't just let her lie on the floor...

239
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,020
Be quick, don't waste time!

240
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,560
What are you waiting for?

241
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,640
What a noob!

242
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,280
You go behind, I'll hold her up.

243
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,780
Quick!

244
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,360
Candy, you okay? Are you hurt?

245
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,840
You stay here, and hold her.

246
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,760
Strange... I though we have passed this road just now.

247
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,520
Sorry, I thought I saw something!

248
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,780
But you're doing good! Keep it up.

249
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,520
Stay away!

250
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,880
Amen! Amen!

251
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,940
Stay away! Fuck!

252
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,040
Ah Kit...

253
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,010
Xiao Wen, what is it?

254
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,940
Have you guys reached the office?

255
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,080
Where are you guys?

256
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,820
What are you doing here?

257
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,940
Don't look, stay back.

258
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,630
Up...up...

259
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,280
What is it?

260
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,040
Up...up...up there!

261
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,280
What is it?

262
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,970
Hey, it's their van!

263
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,620
Where are they?

264
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,680
Let's search around.

265
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,230
Hey, I found Candy!

266
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,160
Where?

267
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,970
Here! Come give me a hand.

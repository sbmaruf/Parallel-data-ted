THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES bySIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

2
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:10,229
ADVENTURE I.A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

3
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:17,023
I.To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman.

4
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:21,139
I have seldom heard him mention her underany other name.

5
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:25,689
In his eyes she eclipses and predominatesthe whole of her sex.

6
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:30,075
It was not that he felt any emotion akin tolove for Irene Adler.

7
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,639
All emotions, and that one particularly,were abhorrent to his cold, precise but

8
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,079
admirably balanced mind.

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,819
He was, I take it, the most perfectreasoning and observing machine that the

10
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:48,009
world has seen, but as a lover he wouldhave placed himself in a false position.

11
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:53,749
He never spoke of the softer passions, savewith a gibe and a sneer.

12
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:57,085
They were admirable things for theobserver--excellent for drawing the veil

13
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:00,013
from men's motives and actions.

14
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:05,013
But for the trained reasoner to admit suchintrusions into his own delicate and finely

15
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:10,028
adjusted temperament was to introduce adistracting factor which might throw a

16
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,012
doubt upon all his mental results.

17
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:18,065
Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crackin one of his own high-power lenses, would

18
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:23,049
not be more disturbing than a strongemotion in a nature such as his.

19
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:29,026
And yet there was but one woman to him, andthat woman was the late Irene Adler, of

20
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:35,002
dubious and questionable memory.I had seen little of Holmes lately.

21
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:38,035
My marriage had drifted us away from eachother.

22
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:43,024
My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the

23
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:48,019
man who first finds himself master of hisown establishment, were sufficient to

24
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:51,084
absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who

25
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:57,002
loathed every form of society with hiswhole Bohemian soul, remained in our

26
00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:02,051
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among hisold books, and alternating from week to

27
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:05,052
week between cocaine and ambition, the

28
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:10,669
drowsiness of the drug, and the fierceenergy of his own keen nature.

29
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:17,013
He was still, as ever, deeply attracted bythe study of crime, and occupied his

30
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:22,069
immense faculties and extraordinary powersof observation in following out those

31
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,419
clues, and clearing up those mysteries

32
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:29,091
which had been abandoned as hopeless by theofficial police.

33
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:35,089
From time to time I heard some vagueaccount of his doings: of his summons to

34
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:40,479
Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder,of his clearing up of the singular tragedy

35
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,099
of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,

36
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,709
and finally of the mission which he hadaccomplished so delicately and successfully

37
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,078
for the reigning family of Holland.

38
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:56,019
Beyond these signs of his activity,however, which I merely shared with all the

39
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,039
readers of the daily press, I knew littleof my former friend and companion.

40
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,099
One night--it was on the twentieth ofMarch, 1888--I was returning from a journey

41
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,044
to a patient (for I had now returned tocivil practice), when my way led me through

42
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:14,839
Baker Street.

43
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:20,052
As I passed the well-remembered door, whichmust always be associated in my mind with

44
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:26,229
my wooing, and with the dark incidents ofthe Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a

45
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,022
keen desire to see Holmes again, and to

46
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:32,679
know how he was employing his extraordinarypowers.

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:39,069
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, evenas I looked up, I saw his tall, spare

48
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,129
figure pass twice in a dark silhouetteagainst the blind.

49
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,649
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly,with his head sunk upon his chest and his

50
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:51,005
hands clasped behind him.

51
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:56,819
To me, who knew his every mood and habit,his attitude and manner told their own

52
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,047
story.He was at work again.

53
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:05,014
He had risen out of his drug-created dreamsand was hot upon the scent of some new

54
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,419
problem.

55
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,419
I rang the bell and was shown up to thechamber which had formerly been in part my

56
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,369
own.His manner was not effusive.

57
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:18,019
It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, tosee me.

58
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,004
With hardly a word spoken, but with akindly eye, he waved me to an armchair,

59
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:29,058
threw across his case of cigars, andindicated a spirit case and a gasogene in

60
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:30,091
the corner.

61
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:37,077
Then he stood before the fire and looked meover in his singular introspective fashion.

62
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:43,003
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked."I think, Watson, that you have put on

63
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:46,049
seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

64
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:49,008
"Seven!"I answered.

65
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,098
"Indeed, I should have thought a littlemore.

66
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:54,079
Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.

67
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,095
And in practice again, I observe.You did not tell me that you intended to go

68
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:04,003
into harness.""Then, how do you know?"

69
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,076
"I see it, I deduce it.

70
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:10,099
How do I know that you have been gettingyourself very wet lately, and that you have

71
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:18,029
a most clumsy and careless servant girl?""My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too

72
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,032
much.

73
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:24,013
You would certainly have been burned, hadyou lived a few centuries ago.

74
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:29,091
It is true that I had a country walk onThursday and came home in a dreadful mess,

75
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:34,091
but as I have changed my clothes I can'timagine how you deduce it.

76
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:40,032
As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, andmy wife has given her notice, but there,

77
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:47,001
again, I fail to see how you work it out."He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long,

78
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,066
nervous hands together.

79
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:55,027
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "myeyes tell me that on the inside of your

80
00:05:55,027 --> 00:06:01,026
left shoe, just where the firelight strikesit, the leather is scored by six almost

81
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,092
parallel cuts.

82
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:07,056
Obviously they have been caused by someonewho has very carelessly scraped round the

83
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:11,088
edges of the sole in order to removecrusted mud from it.

84
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:17,036
Hence, you see, my double deduction thatyou had been out in vile weather, and that

85
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:23,035
you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.

86
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:29,022
As to your practice, if a gentleman walksinto my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a

87
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:34,098
black mark of nitrate of silver upon hisright forefinger, and a bulge on the right

88
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:37,004
side of his top-hat to show where he has

89
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:44,022
secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an

90
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:47,006
active member of the medical profession."

91
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:51,084
I could not help laughing at the ease withwhich he explained his process of

92
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:52,035
deduction.

93
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:59,033
"When I hear you give your reasons," Iremarked, "the thing always appears to me

94
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:05,017
to be so ridiculously simple that I couldeasily do it myself, though at each

95
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:09,066
successive instance of your reasoning I ambaffled until you explain your process.

96
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:14,012
And yet I believe that my eyes are as goodas yours."

97
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:18,098
"Quite so," he answered, lighting acigarette, and throwing himself down into

98
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:23,047
an armchair."You see, but you do not observe.

99
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,027
The distinction is clear.

100
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:29,091
For example, you have frequently seen thesteps which lead up from the hall to this

101
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,088
room.""Frequently."

102
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:34,054
"How often?"

103
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:41,003
"Well, some hundreds of times.""Then how many are there?"

104
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,003
"How many?I don't know."

105
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:45,075
"Quite so!

106
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:49,009
You have not observed.And yet you have seen.

107
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,028
That is just my point.Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,

108
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:57,024
because I have both seen and observed.

109
00:07:57,024 --> 00:08:01,079
By-the-way, since you are interested inthese little problems, and since you are

110
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,008
good enough to chronicle one or two of mytrifling experiences, you may be interested

111
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,025
in this."

112
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:13,078
He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tintednote-paper which had been lying open upon

113
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:18,041
the table."It came by the last post," said he.

114
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,062
"Read it aloud."

115
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:26,024
The note was undated, and without eithersignature or address.

116
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:31,097
"There will call upon you to-night, at aquarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a

117
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:37,759
gentleman who desires to consult you upon amatter of the very deepest moment.

118
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,269
Your recent services to one of the royalhouses of Europe have shown that you are

119
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,039
one who may safely be trusted with matterswhich are of an importance which can hardly

120
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,849
be exaggerated.

121
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:53,559
This account of you we have from allquarters received.

122
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,002
Be in your chamber then at that hour, anddo not take it amiss if your visitor wear a

123
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,045
mask."

124
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:07,879
"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked."What do you imagine that it means?"

125
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,739
"I have no data yet.It is a capital mistake to theorize before

126
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,689
one has data.

127
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:19,095
Insensibly one begins to twist facts tosuit theories, instead of theories to suit

128
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:22,739
facts.But the note itself.

129
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,052
What do you deduce from it?"

130
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:31,299
I carefully examined the writing, and thepaper upon which it was written.

131
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:37,022
"The man who wrote it was presumably wellto do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate

132
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:39,004
my companion's processes.

133
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:43,239
"Such paper could not be bought under halfa crown a packet.

134
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:50,027
It is peculiarly strong and stiff.""Peculiar--that is the very word," said

135
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,049
Holmes.

136
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,939
"It is not an English paper at all.Hold it up to the light."

137
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:04,729
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small"g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small

138
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:09,001
"t" woven into the texture of the paper.

139
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:16,129
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes."The name of the maker, no doubt; or his

140
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:18,299
monogram, rather.""Not at all.

141
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,669
The 'G' with the small 't' stands for'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for

142
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:27,007
'Company.'It is a customary contraction like our

143
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,479
'Co.'

144
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:34,052
'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.'Now for the 'Eg.'

145
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:38,027
Let us glance at our ContinentalGazetteer."

146
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:41,869
He took down a heavy brown volume from hisshelves.

147
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:50,179
"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria.It is in a German-speaking country--in

148
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,419
Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.

149
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:58,489
'Remarkable as being the scene of the deathof Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-

150
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:03,989
factories and paper-mills.'Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?"

151
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:08,039
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a greatblue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

152
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:14,076
"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said."Precisely.

153
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:18,169
And the man who wrote the note is a German.

154
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:23,349
Do you note the peculiar construction ofthe sentence--'This account of you we have

155
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,939
from all quarters received.'A Frenchman or Russian could not have

156
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,099
written that.

157
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:33,007
It is the German who is so uncourteous tohis verbs.

158
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:37,799
It only remains, therefore, to discoverwhat is wanted by this German who writes

159
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,065
upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing amask to showing his face.

160
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:49,859
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, toresolve all our doubts."

161
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:53,969
As he spoke there was the sharp sound ofhorses' hoofs and grating wheels against

162
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,659
the curb, followed by a sharp pull at thebell.

163
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,053
Holmes whistled.

164
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:05,439
"A pair, by the sound," said he."Yes," he continued, glancing out of the

165
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:08,229
window."A nice little brougham and a pair of

166
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,249
beauties.

167
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:13,089
A hundred and fifty guineas apiece.There's money in this case, Watson, if

168
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:19,409
there is nothing else.""I think that I had better go, Holmes."

169
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:20,096
"Not a bit, Doctor.

170
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:24,559
Stay where you are.I am lost without my Boswell.

171
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,032
And this promises to be interesting.It would be a pity to miss it."

172
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:30,939
"But your client--"

173
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:35,369
"Never mind him.I may want your help, and so may he.

174
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,989
Here he comes.Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give

175
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,229
us your best attention."

176
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:47,739
A slow and heavy step, which had been heardupon the stairs and in the passage, paused

177
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:52,004
immediately outside the door.Then there was a loud and authoritative

178
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,609
tap.

179
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:58,083
"Come in!" said Holmes.A man entered who could hardly have been

180
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:04,008
less than six feet six inches in height,with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.

181
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:10,008
His dress was rich with a richness whichwould, in England, be looked upon as akin

182
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:12,289
to bad taste.

183
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:16,719
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashedacross the sleeves and fronts of his

184
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:21,052
double-breasted coat, while the deep bluecloak which was thrown over his shoulders

185
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,359
was lined with flame-coloured silk and

186
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:29,919
secured at the neck with a brooch whichconsisted of a single flaming beryl.

187
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,679
Boots which extended halfway up his calves,and which were trimmed at the tops with

188
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,489
rich brown fur, completed the impression ofbarbaric opulence which was suggested by

189
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:42,034
his whole appearance.

190
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:47,659
He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand,while he wore across the upper part of his

191
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:54,029
face, extending down past the cheekbones, ablack vizard mask, which he had apparently

192
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:59,034
adjusted that very moment, for his hand wasstill raised to it as he entered.

193
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:04,119
From the lower part of the face he appearedto be a man of strong character, with a

194
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:09,096
thick, hanging lip, and a long, straightchin suggestive of resolution pushed to the

195
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:12,799
length of obstinacy.

196
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,051
"You had my note?" he asked with a deepharsh voice and a strongly marked German

197
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:22,083
accent."I told you that I would call."

198
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:28,077
He looked from one to the other of us, asif uncertain which to address.

199
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,499
"Pray take a seat," said Holmes.

200
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:36,489
"This is my friend and colleague, Dr.Watson, who is occasionally good enough to

201
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:41,051
help me in my cases.Whom have I the honour to address?"

202
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:46,779
"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm,a Bohemian nobleman.

203
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:53,014
I understand that this gentleman, yourfriend, is a man of honour and discretion,

204
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:57,559
whom I may trust with a matter of the mostextreme importance.

205
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,219
If not, I should much prefer to communicatewith you alone."

206
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:08,059
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by thewrist and pushed me back into my chair.

207
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,669
"It is both, or none," said he.

208
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:16,279
"You may say before this gentleman anythingwhich you may say to me."

209
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,033
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders.

210
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:26,929
"Then I must begin," said he, "by bindingyou both to absolute secrecy for two years;

211
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,879
at the end of that time the matter will beof no importance.

212
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,239
At present it is not too much to say thatit is of such weight it may have an

213
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:44,109
influence upon European history.""I promise," said Holmes.

214
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,979
"And I."

215
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:50,799
"You will excuse this mask," continued ourstrange visitor.

216
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,077
"The august person who employs me wisheshis agent to be unknown to you, and I may

217
00:15:56,077 --> 00:16:02,099
confess at once that the title by which Ihave just called myself is not exactly my

218
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:02,014
own."

219
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:07,369
"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

220
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:13,539
"The circumstances are of great delicacy,and every precaution has to be taken to

221
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:19,469
quench what might grow to be an immensescandal and seriously compromise one of the

222
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,669
reigning families of Europe.

223
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:28,008
To speak plainly, the matter implicates thegreat House of Ormstein, hereditary kings

224
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:30,004
of Bohemia."

225
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:35,439
"I was also aware of that," murmuredHolmes, settling himself down in his

226
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,229
armchair and closing his eyes.

227
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:43,089
Our visitor glanced with some apparentsurprise at the languid, lounging figure of

228
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:48,629
the man who had been no doubt depicted tohim as the most incisive reasoner and most

229
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,027
energetic agent in Europe.

230
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:57,849
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and lookedimpatiently at his gigantic client.

231
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:03,909
"If your Majesty would condescend to stateyour case," he remarked, "I should be

232
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:06,083
better able to advise you."

233
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:11,024
The man sprang from his chair and paced upand down the room in uncontrollable

234
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,058
agitation.

235
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,909
Then, with a gesture of desperation, hetore the mask from his face and hurled it

236
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:21,679
upon the ground."You are right," he cried; "I am the King.

237
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,549
Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

238
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,249
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes.

239
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:33,529
"Your Majesty had not spoken before I wasaware that I was addressing Wilhelm

240
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:40,259
Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, GrandDuke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary

241
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,007
King of Bohemia."

242
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:48,004
"But you can understand," said our strangevisitor, sitting down once more and passing

243
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:54,159
his hand over his high white forehead, "youcan understand that I am not accustomed to

244
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,069
doing such business in my own person.

245
00:17:56,069 --> 00:18:01,869
Yet the matter was so delicate that I couldnot confide it to an agent without putting

246
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:06,529
myself in his power.I have come incognito from Prague for the

247
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:09,046
purpose of consulting you."

248
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:15,369
"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shuttinghis eyes once more.

249
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:21,379
"The facts are briefly these: Some fiveyears ago, during a lengthy visit to

250
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:27,008
Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of thewell-known adventuress, Irene Adler.

251
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:31,098
The name is no doubt familiar to you."

252
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:37,084
"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,"murmured Holmes without opening his eyes.

253
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:42,008
For many years he had adopted a system ofdocketing all paragraphs concerning men and

254
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:48,031
things, so that it was difficult to name asubject or a person on which he could not

255
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:51,018
at once furnish information.

256
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:55,034
In this case I found her biographysandwiched in between that of a Hebrew

257
00:18:55,034 --> 00:19:00,005
rabbi and that of a staff-commander who hadwritten a monograph upon the deep-sea

258
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:00,055
fishes.

259
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:05,139
"Let me see!" said Holmes."Hum!

260
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:12,499
Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.Contralto--hum!

261
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:15,034
La Scala, hum!

262
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:22,072
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes!Retired from operatic stage--ha!

263
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:26,008
Living in London--quite so!

264
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:31,889
Your Majesty, as I understand, becameentangled with this young person, wrote her

265
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:38,071
some compromising letters, and is nowdesirous of getting those letters back."

266
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,073
"Precisely so.

267
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:43,129
But how--""Was there a secret marriage?"

268
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:47,098
"None.""No legal papers or certificates?"

269
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,149
"None."

270
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:53,097
"Then I fail to follow your Majesty.If this young person should produce her

271
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:59,389
letters for blackmailing or other purposes,how is she to prove their authenticity?"

272
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,011
"There is the writing."

273
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,909
"Pooh, pooh!Forgery."

274
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:08,072
"My private note-paper.""Stolen."

275
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:12,249
"My own seal."

276
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:15,649
"Imitated.""My photograph."

277
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:20,032
"Bought.""We were both in the photograph."

278
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,079
"Oh, dear!

279
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,096
That is very bad!Your Majesty has indeed committed an

280
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:31,749
indiscretion.""I was mad--insane."

281
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,011
"You have compromised yourself seriously."

282
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:38,044
"I was only Crown Prince then.I was young.

283
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:43,061
I am but thirty now.""It must be recovered."

284
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:46,083
"We have tried and failed."

285
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,057
"Your Majesty must pay.It must be bought."

286
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:54,048
"She will not sell.""Stolen, then."

287
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:57,119
"Five attempts have been made.

288
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,068
Twice burglars in my pay ransacked herhouse.

289
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:03,999
Once we diverted her luggage when shetravelled.

290
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,989
Twice she has been waylaid.

291
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:09,489
There has been no result.""No sign of it?"

292
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:15,149
"Absolutely none."Holmes laughed.

293
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,092
"It is quite a pretty little problem," saidhe.

294
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:25,639
"But a very serious one to me," returnedthe King reproachfully.

295
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,369
"Very, indeed.

296
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,279
And what does she propose to do with thephotograph?"

297
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,082
"To ruin me.""But how?"

298
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:38,029
"I am about to be married."

299
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:43,999
"So I have heard.""To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen,

300
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:49,044
second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.You may know the strict principles of her

301
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:50,619
family.

302
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:57,017
She is herself the very soul of delicacy.A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would

303
00:21:57,017 --> 00:22:03,149
bring the matter to an end.""And Irene Adler?"

304
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:04,083
"Threatens to send them the photograph.

305
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:09,021
And she will do it.I know that she will do it.

306
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:13,149
You do not know her, but she has a soul ofsteel.

307
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:17,098
She has the face of the most beautiful ofwomen, and the mind of the most resolute of

308
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,002
men.

309
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:23,529
Rather than I should marry another woman,there are no lengths to which she would not

310
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:28,019
go--none.""You are sure that she has not sent it

311
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:28,061
yet?"

312
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:33,029
"I am sure.""And why?"

313
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:37,889
"Because she has said that she would sendit on the day when the betrothal was

314
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,067
publicly proclaimed.

315
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:46,017
That will be next Monday.""Oh, then we have three days yet," said

316
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:47,529
Holmes with a yawn.

317
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:52,739
"That is very fortunate, as I have one ortwo matters of importance to look into just

318
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:56,011
at present.Your Majesty will, of course, stay in

319
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:57,018
London for the present?"

320
00:22:57,018 --> 00:23:02,006
"Certainly.You will find me at the Langham under the

321
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:07,003
name of the Count Von Kramm.""Then I shall drop you a line to let you

322
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,082
know how we progress."

323
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:14,033
"Pray do so.I shall be all anxiety."

324
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:19,072
"Then, as to money?""You have carte blanche."

325
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,989
"Absolutely?"

326
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:27,033
"I tell you that I would give one of theprovinces of my kingdom to have that

327
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:30,509
photograph.""And for present expenses?"

328
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,759
The King took a heavy chamois leather bagfrom under his cloak and laid it on the

329
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:39,002
table."There are three hundred pounds in gold and

330
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,999
seven hundred in notes," he said.

331
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:47,007
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet ofhis note-book and handed it to him.

332
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:54,095
"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked."Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St.

333
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:57,022
John's Wood."

334
00:23:57,022 --> 00:24:02,239
Holmes took a note of it."One other question," said he.

335
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:07,109
"Was the photograph a cabinet?""It was."

336
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:11,067
"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and Itrust that we shall soon have some good

337
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:13,019
news for you.

338
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,002
And good-night, Watson," he added, as thewheels of the royal brougham rolled down

339
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:19,529
the street.

340
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:24,239
"If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should

341
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,609
like to chat this little matter over withyou."

342
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:34,739
II.At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker

343
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,879
Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.

344
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:42,119
The landlady informed me that he had leftthe house shortly after eight o'clock in

345
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,239
the morning.

346
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:48,379
I sat down beside the fire, however, withthe intention of awaiting him, however long

347
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:48,899
he might be.

348
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:54,058
I was already deeply interested in hisinquiry, for, though it was surrounded by

349
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:59,489
none of the grim and strange features whichwere associated with the two crimes which I

350
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,859
have already recorded, still, the nature of

351
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:08,045
the case and the exalted station of hisclient gave it a character of its own.

352
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:13,096
Indeed, apart from the nature of theinvestigation which my friend had on hand,

353
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:20,159
there was something in his masterly graspof a situation, and his keen, incisive

354
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,019
reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me

355
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,057
to study his system of work, and to followthe quick, subtle methods by which he

356
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:31,369
disentangled the most inextricablemysteries.

357
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:36,259
So accustomed was I to his invariablesuccess that the very possibility of his

358
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,989
failing had ceased to enter into my head.

359
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:45,279
It was close upon four before the dooropened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-

360
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,009
kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamedface and disreputable clothes, walked into

361
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,609
the room.

362
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:58,639
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazingpowers in the use of disguises, I had to

363
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:03,259
look three times before I was certain thatit was indeed he.

364
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,097
With a nod he vanished into the bedroom,whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-

365
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:11,003
suited and respectable, as of old.

366
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:15,056
Putting his hands into his pockets, hestretched out his legs in front of the fire

367
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:18,082
and laughed heartily for some minutes.

368
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:24,129
"Well, really!" he cried, and then hechoked and laughed again until he was

369
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:28,989
obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, inthe chair.

370
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:29,379
"What is it?"

371
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:35,369
"It's quite too funny.I am sure you could never guess how I

372
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,059
employed my morning, or what I ended bydoing."

373
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,519
"I can't imagine.

374
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,017
I suppose that you have been watching thehabits, and perhaps the house, of Miss

375
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:50,084
Irene Adler.""Quite so; but the sequel was rather

376
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:52,259
unusual.

377
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:56,379
I will tell you, however.I left the house a little after eight

378
00:26:56,379 --> 00:27:00,034
o'clock this morning in the character of agroom out of work.

379
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:04,759
There is a wonderful sympathy andfreemasonry among horsey men.

380
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:09,019
Be one of them, and you will know all thatthere is to know.

381
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,083
I soon found Briony Lodge.

382
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:16,008
It is a bijou villa, with a garden at theback, but built out in front right up to

383
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:20,081
the road, two stories.Chubb lock to the door.

384
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:26,109
Large sitting-room on the right side, wellfurnished, with long windows almost to the

385
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:32,031
floor, and those preposterous Englishwindow fasteners which a child could open.

386
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:36,389
Behind there was nothing remarkable, savethat the passage window could be reached

387
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,739
from the top of the coach-house.

388
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:43,659
I walked round it and examined it closelyfrom every point of view, but without

389
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:46,889
noting anything else of interest.

390
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:52,084
"I then lounged down the street and found,as I expected, that there was a mews in a

391
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:56,002
lane which runs down by one wall of thegarden.

392
00:27:56,002 --> 00:28:01,409
I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing downtheir horses, and received in exchange

393
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:06,097
twopence, a glass of half and half, twofills of shag tobacco, and as much

394
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:09,489
information as I could desire about Miss

395
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:14,044
Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen otherpeople in the neighbourhood in whom I was

396
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:20,609
not in the least interested, but whosebiographies I was compelled to listen to."

397
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,529
"And what of Irene Adler?"

398
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:26,649
I asked."Oh, she has turned all the men's heads

399
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:30,609
down in that part.She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet

400
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,005
on this planet.

401
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:38,083
So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.She lives quietly, sings at concerts,

402
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:43,869
drives out at five every day, and returnsat seven sharp for dinner.

403
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:47,043
Seldom goes out at other times, except whenshe sings.

404
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:51,009
Has only one male visitor, but a good dealof him.

405
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:56,056
He is dark, handsome, and dashing, nevercalls less than once a day, and often

406
00:28:56,056 --> 00:29:00,989
twice.He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner

407
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,759
Temple.

408
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,047
See the advantages of a cabman as aconfidant.

409
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:12,056
They had driven him home a dozen times fromSerpentine-mews, and knew all about him.

410
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:16,979
When I had listened to all they had totell, I began to walk up and down near

411
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:22,046
Briony Lodge once more, and to think overmy plan of campaign.

412
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:27,629
"This Godfrey Norton was evidently animportant factor in the matter.

413
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:31,249
He was a lawyer.That sounded ominous.

414
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:37,019
What was the relation between them, andwhat the object of his repeated visits?

415
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,379
Was she his client, his friend, or hismistress?

416
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:47,249
If the former, she had probably transferredthe photograph to his keeping.

417
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:50,044
If the latter, it was less likely.

418
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:55,007
On the issue of this question dependedwhether I should continue my work at Briony

419
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:59,082
Lodge, or turn my attention to thegentleman's chambers in the Temple.

420
00:29:59,082 --> 00:30:04,059
It was a delicate point, and it widened thefield of my inquiry.

421
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:09,359
I fear that I bore you with these details,but I have to let you see my little

422
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,082
difficulties, if you are to understand thesituation."

423
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:18,749
"I am following you closely," I answered.

424
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:24,239
"I was still balancing the matter in mymind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony

425
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,081
Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.

426
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:33,031
He was a remarkably handsome man, dark,aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man

427
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,159
of whom I had heard.

428
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,081
He appeared to be in a great hurry, shoutedto the cabman to wait, and brushed past the

429
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:45,479
maid who opened the door with the air of aman who was thoroughly at home.

430
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:49,085
"He was in the house about half an hour,and I could catch glimpses of him in the

431
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:55,057
windows of the sitting-room, pacing up anddown, talking excitedly, and waving his

432
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:56,081
arms.

433
00:30:56,081 --> 00:31:01,072
Of her I could see nothing.Presently he emerged, looking even more

434
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:03,859
flurried than before.

435
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:08,489
As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled agold watch from his pocket and looked at it

436
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:14,529
earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' heshouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in

437
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:19,409
Regent Street, and then to the Church ofSt. Monica in the Edgeware Road.

438
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,509
Half a guinea if you do it in twentyminutes!'

439
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:27,072
"Away they went, and I was just wonderingwhether I should not do well to follow them

440
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:33,499
when up the lane came a neat little landau,the coachman with his coat only half-

441
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,056
buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while

442
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:40,399
all the tags of his harness were stickingout of the buckles.

443
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,529
It hadn't pulled up before she shot out ofthe hall door and into it.

444
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,869
I only caught a glimpse of her at themoment, but she was a lovely woman, with a

445
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:51,849
face that a man might die for.

446
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:56,759
"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' shecried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach

447
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,081
it in twenty minutes.'"This was quite too good to lose, Watson.

448
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:06,083
I was just balancing whether I should runfor it, or whether I should perch behind

449
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:10,031
her landau when a cab came through thestreet.

450
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:14,369
The driver looked twice at such a shabbyfare, but I jumped in before he could

451
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:14,081
object.

452
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:20,057
'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'andhalf a sovereign if you reach it in twenty

453
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,056
minutes.'

454
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:25,629
It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, andof course it was clear enough what was in

455
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:29,139
the wind."My cabby drove fast.

456
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:34,069
I don't think I ever drove faster, but theothers were there before us.

457
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:38,369
The cab and the landau with their steaminghorses were in front of the door when I

458
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:38,999
arrived.

459
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:45,018
I paid the man and hurried into the church.There was not a soul there save the two

460
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:50,229
whom I had followed and a surplicedclergyman, who seemed to be expostulating

461
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,045
with them.

462
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:55,029
They were all three standing in a knot infront of the altar.

463
00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:00,046
I lounged up the side aisle like any otheridler who has dropped into a church.

464
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:06,369
Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at thealtar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton

465
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:09,045
came running as hard as he could towardsme.

466
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,045
"'Thank God,' he cried.

467
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,889
'You'll do.Come!

468
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:15,619
Come!'"'What then?'

469
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,034
I asked.

470
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:21,769
"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, orit won't be legal.'

471
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:27,031
"I was half-dragged up to the altar, andbefore I knew where I was I found myself

472
00:33:27,031 --> 00:33:32,379
mumbling responses which were whispered inmy ear, and vouching for things of which I

473
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:35,008
knew nothing, and generally assisting in

474
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:41,093
the secure tying up of Irene Adler,spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.

475
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:46,047
It was all done in an instant, and therewas the gentleman thanking me on the one

476
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:52,409
side and the lady on the other, while theclergyman beamed on me in front.

477
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:58,279
It was the most preposterous position inwhich I ever found myself in my life, and

478
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,095
it was the thought of it that started melaughing just now.

479
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:07,259
It seems that there had been someinformality about their license, that the

480
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:12,054
clergyman absolutely refused to marry themwithout a witness of some sort, and that my

481
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:14,719
lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from

482
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,159
having to sally out into the streets insearch of a best man.

483
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,989
The bride gave me a sovereign, and I meanto wear it on my watch-chain in memory of

484
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,037
the occasion."

485
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:31,929
"This is a very unexpected turn ofaffairs," said I; "and what then?"

486
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,729
"Well, I found my plans very seriouslymenaced.

487
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:40,479
It looked as if the pair might take animmediate departure, and so necessitate

488
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:43,479
very prompt and energetic measures on mypart.

489
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:49,499
At the church door, however, theyseparated, he driving back to the Temple,

490
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:55,219
and she to her own house.'I shall drive out in the park at five as

491
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,033
usual,' she said as she left him.

492
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:01,048
I heard no more.They drove away in different directions,

493
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:04,051
and I went off to make my ownarrangements."

494
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,209
"Which are?"

495
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:11,439
"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," heanswered, ringing the bell.

496
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:16,009
"I have been too busy to think of food, andI am likely to be busier still this

497
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,012
evening.

498
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:21,052
By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

499
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:26,088
"I shall be delighted.""You don't mind breaking the law?"

500
00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:28,088
"Not in the least."

501
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:34,011
"Nor running a chance of arrest?""Not in a good cause."

502
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:39,037
"Oh, the cause is excellent!""Then I am your man."

503
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:42,059
"I was sure that I might rely on you."

504
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,949
"But what is it you wish?""When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I

505
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,098
will make it clear to you.

506
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:56,006
Now," he said as he turned hungrily on thesimple fare that our landlady had provided,

507
00:35:56,006 --> 00:35:59,037
"I must discuss it while I eat, for I havenot much time.

508
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,055
It is nearly five now.

509
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:06,159
In two hours we must be on the scene ofaction.

510
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,031
Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns fromher drive at seven.

511
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:14,057
We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

512
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:18,659
"And what then?""You must leave that to me.

513
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,086
I have already arranged what is to occur.There is only one point on which I must

514
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:24,077
insist.

515
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:29,084
You must not interfere, come what may.You understand?"

516
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:34,469
"I am to be neutral?""To do nothing whatever.

517
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:38,459
There will probably be some smallunpleasantness.

518
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:42,037
Do not join in it.It will end in my being conveyed into the

519
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:43,005
house.

520
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:47,008
Four or five minutes afterwards thesitting-room window will open.

521
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:51,006
You are to station yourself close to thatopen window."

522
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,002
"Yes."

523
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,659
"You are to watch me, for I will be visibleto you."

524
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,007
"Yes."

525
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:03,179
"And when I raise my hand--so--you willthrow into the room what I give you to

526
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:08,037
throw, and will, at the same time, raisethe cry of fire.

527
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:09,037
You quite follow me?"

528
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:15,179
"Entirely.""It is nothing very formidable," he said,

529
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,083
taking a long cigar-shaped roll from hispocket.

530
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:23,081
"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,fitted with a cap at either end to make it

531
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:28,007
self-lighting.Your task is confined to that.

532
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:33,024
When you raise your cry of fire, it will betaken up by quite a number of people.

533
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:38,008
You may then walk to the end of the street,and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.

534
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,098
I hope that I have made myself clear?"

535
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:47,929
"I am to remain neutral, to get near thewindow, to watch you, and at the signal to

536
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:54,179
throw in this object, then to raise the cryof fire, and to wait you at the corner of

537
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,049
the street."

538
00:37:55,049 --> 00:38:00,049
"Precisely.""Then you may entirely rely on me."

539
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:04,053
"That is excellent.I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I

540
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:08,076
prepare for the new role I have to play."

541
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:13,002
He disappeared into his bedroom andreturned in a few minutes in the character

542
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:18,003
of an amiable and simple-mindedNonconformist clergyman.

543
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:25,011
His broad black hat, his baggy trousers,his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and

544
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:30,085
general look of peering and benevolentcuriosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone

545
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:32,036
could have equalled.

546
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:35,949
It was not merely that Holmes changed hiscostume.

547
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:41,051
His expression, his manner, his very soulseemed to vary with every fresh part that

548
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,098
he assumed.

549
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:48,037
The stage lost a fine actor, even asscience lost an acute reasoner, when he

550
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:50,035
became a specialist in crime.

551
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:57,015
It was a quarter past six when we leftBaker Street, and it still wanted ten

552
00:38:57,015 --> 00:39:00,031
minutes to the hour when we found ourselvesin Serpentine Avenue.

553
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:06,014
It was already dusk, and the lamps werejust being lighted as we paced up and down

554
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:11,012
in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for thecoming of its occupant.

555
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:15,081
The house was just such as I had picturedit from Sherlock Holmes' succinct

556
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:21,004
description, but the locality appeared tobe less private than I expected.

557
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:26,669
On the contrary, for a small street in aquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably

558
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,005
animated.

559
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:32,078
There was a group of shabbily dressed mensmoking and laughing in a corner, a

560
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:37,029
scissors-grinder with his wheel, twoguardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-

561
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,012
girl, and several well-dressed young men

562
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:44,003
who were lounging up and down with cigarsin their mouths.

563
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:49,082
"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced toand fro in front of the house, "this

564
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:54,009
marriage rather simplifies matters.The photograph becomes a double-edged

565
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:56,055
weapon now.

566
00:39:56,055 --> 00:40:02,054
The chances are that she would be as averseto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as

567
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:06,449
our client is to its coming to the eyes ofhis princess.

568
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:10,006
Now the question is, Where are we to findthe photograph?"

569
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:16,028
"Where, indeed?""It is most unlikely that she carries it

570
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,399
about with her.

571
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:22,029
It is cabinet size.Too large for easy concealment about a

572
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:25,969
woman's dress.She knows that the King is capable of

573
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,035
having her waylaid and searched.

574
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:31,085
Two attempts of the sort have already beenmade.

575
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:36,008
We may take it, then, that she does notcarry it about with her."

576
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:38,001
"Where, then?"

577
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:43,033
"Her banker or her lawyer.There is that double possibility.

578
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:49,008
But I am inclined to think neither.Women are naturally secretive, and they

579
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:51,719
like to do their own secreting.

580
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,003
Why should she hand it over to anyone else?She could trust her own guardianship, but

581
00:40:57,003 --> 00:41:01,074
she could not tell what indirect orpolitical influence might be brought to

582
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:03,085
bear upon a business man.

583
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:09,036
Besides, remember that she had resolved touse it within a few days.

584
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:12,449
It must be where she can lay her hands uponit.

585
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:15,024
It must be in her own house."

586
00:41:15,024 --> 00:41:19,014
"But it has twice been burgled.""Pshaw!

587
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:24,098
They did not know how to look.""But how will you look?"

588
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:26,099
"I will not look."

589
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,037
"What then?""I will get her to show me."

590
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:37,006
"But she will refuse.""She will not be able to.

591
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:39,049
But I hear the rumble of wheels.

592
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:45,459
It is her carriage.Now carry out my orders to the letter."

593
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:49,084
As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights ofa carriage came round the curve of the

594
00:41:49,084 --> 00:41:51,179
avenue.

595
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:56,049
It was a smart little landau which rattledup to the door of Briony Lodge.

596
00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:01,033
As it pulled up, one of the loafing men atthe corner dashed forward to open the door

597
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:06,005
in the hope of earning a copper, but waselbowed away by another loafer, who had

598
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:08,035
rushed up with the same intention.

599
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:12,919
A fierce quarrel broke out, which wasincreased by the two guardsmen, who took

600
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:18,649
sides with one of the loungers, and by thescissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon

601
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:20,209
the other side.

602
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:25,057
A blow was struck, and in an instant thelady, who had stepped from her carriage,

603
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:31,002
was the centre of a little knot of flushedand struggling men, who struck savagely at

604
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:34,149
each other with their fists and sticks.

605
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:39,719
Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect thelady; but just as he reached her he gave a

606
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,057
cry and dropped to the ground, with theblood running freely down his face.

607
00:42:44,057 --> 00:42:49,409
At his fall the guardsmen took to theirheels in one direction and the loungers in

608
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:53,088
the other, while a number of better-dressedpeople, who had watched the scuffle without

609
00:42:53,088 --> 00:43:00,049
taking part in it, crowded in to help thelady and to attend to the injured man.

610
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:06,699
Irene Adler, as I will still call her, hadhurried up the steps; but she stood at the

611
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:12,024
top with her superb figure outlined againstthe lights of the hall, looking back into

612
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:14,028
the street.

613
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:18,012
"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" sheasked.

614
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:24,074
"He is dead," cried several voices."No, no, there's life in him!" shouted

615
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:25,084
another.

616
00:43:25,084 --> 00:43:28,061
"But he'll be gone before you can get himto hospital."

617
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:34,076
"He's a brave fellow," said a woman."They would have had the lady's purse and

618
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:37,024
watch if it hadn't been for him.

619
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:43,429
They were a gang, and a rough one, too.Ah, he's breathing now."

620
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:47,073
"He can't lie in the street.May we bring him in, marm?"

621
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:49,209
"Surely.

622
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,013
Bring him into the sitting-room.There is a comfortable sofa.

623
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:53,659
This way, please!"

624
00:43:53,659 --> 00:44:00,032
Slowly and solemnly he was borne intoBriony Lodge and laid out in the principal

625
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:05,051
room, while I still observed theproceedings from my post by the window.

626
00:44:05,051 --> 00:44:10,054
The lamps had been lit, but the blinds hadnot been drawn, so that I could see Holmes

627
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:11,076
as he lay upon the couch.

628
00:44:11,076 --> 00:44:17,000
I do not know whether he was seized withcompunction at that moment for the part he

629
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,076
was playing, but I know that I never feltmore heartily ashamed of myself in my life

630
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,082
than when I saw the beautiful creature

631
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:30,079
against whom I was conspiring, or the graceand kindliness with which she waited upon

632
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,083
the injured man.

633
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:37,084
And yet it would be the blackest treacheryto Holmes to draw back now from the part

634
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:42,063
which he had intrusted to me.I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-

635
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:45,159
rocket from under my ulster.

636
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:48,649
After all, I thought, we are not injuringher.

637
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:52,087
We are but preventing her from injuringanother.

638
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:57,049
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I sawhim motion like a man who is in need of

639
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:01,009
air.A maid rushed across and threw open the

640
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:01,064
window.

641
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:06,899
At the same instant I saw him raise hishand and at the signal I tossed my rocket

642
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:10,008
into the room with a cry of "Fire!"

643
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:15,037
The word was no sooner out of my mouth thanthe whole crowd of spectators, well dressed

644
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:21,054
and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of

645
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,024
"Fire!"

646
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:27,083
Thick clouds of smoke curled through theroom and out at the open window.

647
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:32,031
I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, anda moment later the voice of Holmes from

648
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,959
within assuring them that it was a falsealarm.

649
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:41,089
Slipping through the shouting crowd I mademy way to the corner of the street, and in

650
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:47,005
ten minutes was rejoiced to find myfriend's arm in mine, and to get away from

651
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,086
the scene of uproar.

652
00:45:48,086 --> 00:45:53,449
He walked swiftly and in silence for somefew minutes until we had turned down one of

653
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:58,007
the quiet streets which lead towards theEdgeware Road.

654
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:01,079
"You did it very nicely, Doctor," heremarked.

655
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,959
"Nothing could have been better.It is all right."

656
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:08,004
"You have the photograph?"

657
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:13,005
"I know where it is.""And how did you find out?"

658
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:18,079
"She showed me, as I told you she would.""I am still in the dark."

659
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,949
"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he,laughing.

660
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:28,089
"The matter was perfectly simple.You, of course, saw that everyone in the

661
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,057
street was an accomplice.

662
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:34,026
They were all engaged for the evening.""I guessed as much."

663
00:46:34,026 --> 00:46:39,005
"Then, when the row broke out, I had alittle moist red paint in the palm of my

664
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,179
hand.

665
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:45,052
I rushed forward, fell down, clapped myhand to my face, and became a piteous

666
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,939
spectacle.It is an old trick."

667
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:51,099
"That also I could fathom."

668
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:55,074
"Then they carried me in.She was bound to have me in.

669
00:46:55,074 --> 00:47:00,000
What else could she do?And into her sitting-room, which was the

670
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,054
very room which I suspected.

671
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:06,026
It lay between that and her bedroom, and Iwas determined to see which.

672
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:12,057
They laid me on a couch, I motioned forair, they were compelled to open the

673
00:47:12,057 --> 00:47:15,062
window, and you had your chance."

674
00:47:15,062 --> 00:47:19,149
"How did that help you?""It was all-important.

675
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:25,012
When a woman thinks that her house is onfire, her instinct is at once to rush to

676
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:27,076
the thing which she values most.

677
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:32,719
It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, andI have more than once taken advantage of

678
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:33,074
it.

679
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:39,000
In the case of the Darlington substitutionscandal it was of use to me, and also in

680
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,699
the Arnsworth Castle business.A married woman grabs at her baby; an

681
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:46,024
unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.

682
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:52,006
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious

683
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:57,083
to her than what we are in quest of.She would rush to secure it.

684
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,073
The alarm of fire was admirably done.

685
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:04,051
The smoke and shouting were enough to shakenerves of steel.

686
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,699
She responded beautifully.

687
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:11,076
The photograph is in a recess behind asliding panel just above the right bell-

688
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:15,033
pull.She was there in an instant, and I caught a

689
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:18,024
glimpse of it as she half-drew it out.

690
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:23,087
When I cried out that it was a false alarm,she replaced it, glanced at the rocket,

691
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:27,048
rushed from the room, and I have not seenher since.

692
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:32,006
I rose, and, making my excuses, escapedfrom the house.

693
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:36,086
I hesitated whether to attempt to securethe photograph at once; but the coachman

694
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:42,001
had come in, and as he was watching menarrowly it seemed safer to wait.

695
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:46,389
A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

696
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,169
"And now?"I asked.

697
00:48:49,169 --> 00:48:54,139
"Our quest is practically finished.I shall call with the King to-morrow, and

698
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,889
with you, if you care to come with us.

699
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:01,459
We will be shown into the sitting-room towait for the lady, but it is probable that

700
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:06,006
when she comes she may find neither us northe photograph.

701
00:49:06,006 --> 00:49:11,909
It might be a satisfaction to his Majestyto regain it with his own hands."

702
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:16,038
"And when will you call?""At eight in the morning.

703
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:20,028
She will not be up, so that we shall have aclear field.

704
00:49:20,028 --> 00:49:25,003
Besides, we must be prompt, for thismarriage may mean a complete change in her

705
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,055
life and habits.

706
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:32,054
I must wire to the King without delay."We had reached Baker Street and had stopped

707
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:35,054
at the door.He was searching his pockets for the key

708
00:49:35,054 --> 00:49:38,031
when someone passing said:

709
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:43,028
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."There were several people on the pavement

710
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:48,149
at the time, but the greeting appeared tocome from a slim youth in an ulster who had

711
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:49,032
hurried by.

712
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:55,085
"I've heard that voice before," saidHolmes, staring down the dimly lit street.

713
00:49:55,085 --> 00:50:01,689
"Now, I wonder who the deuce that couldhave been."

714
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:05,099
III.I slept at Baker Street that night, and we

715
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,929
were engaged upon our toast and coffee inthe morning when the King of Bohemia rushed

716
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:12,057
into the room.

717
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:17,062
"You have really got it!" he cried,grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder

718
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:21,081
and looking eagerly into his face."Not yet."

719
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:23,081
"But you have hopes?"

720
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:26,077
"I have hopes.""Then, come.

721
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:31,149
I am all impatience to be gone.""We must have a cab."

722
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:33,062
"No, my brougham is waiting."

723
00:50:33,062 --> 00:50:39,159
"Then that will simplify matters."We descended and started off once more for

724
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:45,036
Briony Lodge."Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

725
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:46,032
"Married!

726
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:49,419
When?""Yesterday."

727
00:50:49,419 --> 00:50:54,469
"But to whom?""To an English lawyer named Norton."

728
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:55,083
"But she could not love him."

729
00:50:55,083 --> 00:51:02,048
"I am in hopes that she does.""And why in hopes?"

730
00:51:02,048 --> 00:51:07,003
"Because it would spare your Majesty allfear of future annoyance.

731
00:51:07,003 --> 00:51:11,037
If the lady loves her husband, she does notlove your Majesty.

732
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:15,639
If she does not love your Majesty, there isno reason why she should interfere with

733
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,159
your Majesty's plan."

734
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,085
"It is true.And yet--Well!

735
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:26,909
I wish she had been of my own station!What a queen she would have made!"

736
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:31,949
He relapsed into a moody silence, which wasnot broken until we drew up in Serpentine

737
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:35,087
Avenue.The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an

738
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:38,469
elderly woman stood upon the steps.

739
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:43,053
She watched us with a sardonic eye as westepped from the brougham.

740
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:46,031
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

741
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:52,419
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion,looking at her with a questioning and

742
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:56,209
rather startled gaze."Indeed!

743
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:59,469
My mistress told me that you were likely tocall.

744
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:04,199
She left this morning with her husband bythe 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the

745
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:05,006
Continent."

746
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:09,005
"What!"Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with

747
00:52:09,005 --> 00:52:14,052
chagrin and surprise."Do you mean that she has left England?"

748
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:17,036
"Never to return."

749
00:52:17,036 --> 00:52:23,005
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely."All is lost."

750
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:24,939
"We shall see."

751
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:29,024
He pushed past the servant and rushed intothe drawing-room, followed by the King and

752
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:30,389
myself.

753
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:35,159
The furniture was scattered about in everydirection, with dismantled shelves and open

754
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:40,028
drawers, as if the lady had hurriedlyransacked them before her flight.

755
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:45,061
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back asmall sliding shutter, and, plunging in his

756
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:49,052
hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.

757
00:52:49,052 --> 00:52:54,219
The photograph was of Irene Adler herselfin evening dress, the letter was

758
00:52:54,219 --> 00:53:00,028
superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. Tobe left till called for."

759
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:04,719
My friend tore it open and we all threeread it together.

760
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:10,008
It was dated at midnight of the precedingnight and ran in this way:

761
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:15,029
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You reallydid it very well.

762
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:20,013
You took me in completely.Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a

763
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:21,033
suspicion.

764
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:25,939
But then, when I found how I had betrayedmyself, I began to think.

765
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:32,007
I had been warned against you months ago.I had been told that if the King employed

766
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:35,007
an agent it would certainly be you.

767
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:40,032
And your address had been given me.Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what

768
00:53:40,032 --> 00:53:42,025
you wanted to know.

769
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:48,049
Even after I became suspicious, I found ithard to think evil of such a dear, kind old

770
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:52,032
clergyman.But, you know, I have been trained as an

771
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:54,179
actress myself.

772
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:58,679
Male costume is nothing new to me.I often take advantage of the freedom which

773
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:00,007
it gives.

774
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:05,949
I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes,

775
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:10,959
as I call them, and came down just as youdeparted.

776
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:16,005
"Well, I followed you to your door, and somade sure that I was really an object of

777
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:19,929
interest to the celebrated Mr. SherlockHolmes.

778
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:25,034
Then I, rather imprudently, wished yougood-night, and started for the Temple to

779
00:54:25,034 --> 00:54:27,139
see my husband.

780
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:32,002
"We both thought the best resource wasflight, when pursued by so formidable an

781
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:37,026
antagonist; so you will find the nest emptywhen you call to-morrow.

782
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:41,169
As to the photograph, your client may restin peace.

783
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:45,189
I love and am loved by a better man thanhe.

784
00:54:45,189 --> 00:54:48,085
The King may do what he will withouthindrance from one whom he has cruelly

785
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,029
wronged.

786
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:55,061
I keep it only to safeguard myself, and topreserve a weapon which will always secure

787
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:59,083
me from any steps which he might take inthe future.

788
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:05,078
I leave a photograph which he might care topossess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock

789
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:11,149
Holmes,"Very truly yours, "IRENE NORTON, née

790
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:13,008
ADLER."

791
00:55:13,008 --> 00:55:19,028
"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried theKing of Bohemia, when we had all three read

792
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:23,179
this epistle."Did I not tell you how quick and resolute

793
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:24,669
she was?

794
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:29,098
Would she not have made an admirable queen?Is it not a pity that she was not on my

795
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:31,919
level?"

796
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:36,439
"From what I have seen of the lady sheseems indeed to be on a very different

797
00:55:36,439 --> 00:55:40,409
level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly.

798
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:44,629
"I am sorry that I have not been able tobring your Majesty's business to a more

799
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:50,219
successful conclusion.""On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the

800
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:53,469
King; "nothing could be more successful.

801
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:58,031
I know that her word is inviolate.The photograph is now as safe as if it were

802
00:55:58,031 --> 00:56:04,429
in the fire.""I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

803
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:07,033
"I am immensely indebted to you.

804
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:13,051
Pray tell me in what way I can reward you.This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake

805
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:18,000
ring from his finger and held it out uponthe palm of his hand.

806
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,074
"Your Majesty has something which I shouldvalue even more highly," said Holmes.

807
00:56:23,074 --> 00:56:28,026
"You have but to name it.""This photograph!"

808
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:30,719
The King stared at him in amazement.

809
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,027
"Irene's photograph!" he cried."Certainly, if you wish it."

810
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:40,179
"I thank your Majesty.Then there is no more to be done in the

811
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:41,149
matter.

812
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:45,056
I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning."

813
00:56:45,056 --> 00:56:49,001
He bowed, and, turning away withoutobserving the hand which the King had

814
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:53,199
stretched out to him, he set off in mycompany for his chambers.

815
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:59,075
And that was how a great scandal threatenedto affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how

816
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:05,048
the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes werebeaten by a woman's wit.

817
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:10,031
He used to make merry over the clevernessof women, but I have not heard him do it of

818
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:11,409
late.

819
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:17,002
And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or whenhe refers to her photograph, it is always

820
00:57:17,002 --> 00:57:26,006
under the honourable title of the woman.

821
00:57:26,006 --> 00:57:27,006

THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES bySIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

823
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:35,409
ADVENTURE II.THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

824
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:40,064
I had called upon my friend, Mr. SherlockHolmes, one day in the autumn of last year

825
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:46,008
and found him in deep conversation with avery stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman

826
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:48,189
with fiery red hair.

827
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:52,066
With an apology for my intrusion, I wasabout to withdraw when Holmes pulled me

828
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:57,032
abruptly into the room and closed the doorbehind me.

829
00:57:57,032 --> 00:58:01,339
"You could not possibly have come at abetter time, my dear Watson," he said

830
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:05,099
cordially."I was afraid that you were engaged."

831
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,017
"So I am.

832
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:11,094
Very much so.""Then I can wait in the next room."

833
00:58:11,094 --> 00:58:13,036
"Not at all.

834
00:58:13,036 --> 00:58:18,017
This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been mypartner and helper in many of my most

835
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:23,065
successful cases, and I have no doubt thathe will be of the utmost use to me in yours

836
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:25,025
also."

837
00:58:25,025 --> 00:58:29,086
The stout gentleman half rose from hischair and gave a bob of greeting, with a

838
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:34,013
quick little questioning glance from hissmall fat-encircled eyes.

839
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:39,091
"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsinginto his armchair and putting his

840
00:58:39,091 --> 00:58:45,021
fingertips together, as was his custom whenin judicial moods.

841
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:50,017
"I know, my dear Watson, that you share mylove of all that is bizarre and outside the

842
00:58:50,017 --> 00:58:54,002
conventions and humdrum routine of everydaylife.

843
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:58,056
You have shown your relish for it by theenthusiasm which has prompted you to

844
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:05,035
chronicle, and, if you will excuse mysaying so, somewhat to embellish so many of

845
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:08,004
my own little adventures."

846
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:13,088
"Your cases have indeed been of thegreatest interest to me," I observed.

847
00:59:13,088 --> 00:59:18,329
"You will remember that I remarked theother day, just before we went into the

848
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:23,829
very simple problem presented by Miss MarySutherland, that for strange effects and

849
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:26,399
extraordinary combinations we must go to

850
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:32,089
life itself, which is always far moredaring than any effort of the imagination."

851
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:37,038
"A proposition which I took the liberty ofdoubting."

852
00:59:37,038 --> 00:59:42,048
"You did, Doctor, but none the less youmust come round to my view, for otherwise I

853
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:47,091
shall keep on piling fact upon fact on youuntil your reason breaks down under them

854
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:50,052
and acknowledges me to be right.

855
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:57,001
Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been goodenough to call upon me this morning, and to

856
00:59:57,001 --> 01:00:02,089
begin a narrative which promises to be oneof the most singular which I have listened

857
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:03,919
to for some time.

858
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:09,044
You have heard me remark that the strangestand most unique things are very often

859
01:00:09,044 --> 01:00:15,091
connected not with the larger but with thesmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed,

860
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:20,083
where there is room for doubt whether anypositive crime has been committed.

861
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:26,025
As far as I have heard it is impossible forme to say whether the present case is an

862
01:00:26,025 --> 01:00:31,093
instance of crime or not, but the course ofevents is certainly among the most singular

863
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:34,199
that I have ever listened to.

864
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,097
Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have thegreat kindness to recommence your

865
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:40,004
narrative.

866
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:46,014
I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.Watson has not heard the opening part but

867
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:51,229
also because the peculiar nature of thestory makes me anxious to have every

868
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:54,025
possible detail from your lips.

869
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:59,061
As a rule, when I have heard some slightindication of the course of events, I am

870
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:04,011
able to guide myself by the thousands ofother similar cases which occur to my

871
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:05,028
memory.

872
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:10,589
In the present instance I am forced toadmit that the facts are, to the best of my

873
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:13,839
belief, unique."

874
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,005
The portly client puffed out his chest withan appearance of some little pride and

875
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:24,003
pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper fromthe inside pocket of his greatcoat.

876
01:01:24,003 --> 01:01:28,063
As he glanced down the advertisementcolumn, with his head thrust forward and

877
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:33,589
the paper flattened out upon his knee, Itook a good look at the man and

878
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,869
endeavoured, after the fashion of my

879
01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:40,479
companion, to read the indications whichmight be presented by his dress or

880
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,078
appearance.I did not gain very much, however, by my

881
01:01:44,078 --> 01:01:46,089
inspection.

882
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:51,047
Our visitor bore every mark of being anaverage commonplace British tradesman,

883
01:01:51,047 --> 01:01:55,023
obese, pompous, and slow.

884
01:01:55,023 --> 01:02:01,041
He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's checktrousers, a not over-clean black frock-

885
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:07,087
coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drabwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain,

886
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:12,054
and a square pierced bit of metal danglingdown as an ornament.

887
01:02:12,054 --> 01:02:18,005
A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoatwith a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a

888
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:20,003
chair beside him.

889
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:25,078
Altogether, look as I would, there wasnothing remarkable about the man save his

890
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:31,022
blazing red head, and the expression ofextreme chagrin and discontent upon his

891
01:02:31,022 --> 01:02:33,035
features.

892
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:37,059
Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in myoccupation, and he shook his head with a

893
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:42,035
smile as he noticed my questioning glances.

894
01:02:42,035 --> 01:02:47,005
"Beyond the obvious facts that he has atsome time done manual labour, that he takes

895
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:52,009
snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he hasbeen in China, and that he has done a

896
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:59,049
considerable amount of writing lately, Ican deduce nothing else."

897
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:04,009
Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair,with his forefinger upon the paper, but his

898
01:03:04,009 --> 01:03:07,028
eyes upon my companion.

899
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:12,096
"How, in the name of good-fortune, did youknow all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked.

900
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:17,049
"How did you know, for example, that I didmanual labour.

901
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:21,063
It's as true as gospel, for I began as aship's carpenter."

902
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:28,139
"Your hands, my dear sir.Your right hand is quite a size larger than

903
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:29,003
your left.

904
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:31,989
You have worked with it, and the musclesare more developed."

905
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:37,071
"Well, the snuff, then, and theFreemasonry?"

906
01:03:37,071 --> 01:03:42,075
"I won't insult your intelligence bytelling you how I read that, especially as,

907
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:47,859
rather against the strict rules of yourorder, you use an arc-and-compass

908
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:48,035
breastpin."

909
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:55,359
"Ah, of course, I forgot that.But the writing?"

910
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:00,066
"What else can be indicated by that rightcuff so very shiny for five inches, and the

911
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:05,269
left one with the smooth patch near theelbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

912
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:08,032
"Well, but China?"

913
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:12,004
"The fish that you have tattooedimmediately above your right wrist could

914
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:14,066
only have been done in China.

915
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:20,003
I have made a small study of tattoo marksand have even contributed to the literature

916
01:04:20,003 --> 01:04:21,035
of the subject.

917
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:26,073
That trick of staining the fishes' scalesof a delicate pink is quite peculiar to

918
01:04:26,073 --> 01:04:27,549
China.

919
01:04:27,549 --> 01:04:32,009
When, in addition, I see a Chinese coinhanging from your watch-chain, the matter

920
01:04:32,009 --> 01:04:38,053
becomes even more simple."Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily.

921
01:04:38,053 --> 01:04:42,003
"Well, I never!" said he.

922
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:46,084
"I thought at first that you had donesomething clever, but I see that there was

923
01:04:46,084 --> 01:04:53,609
nothing in it, after all.""I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes,

924
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:56,056
"that I make a mistake in explaining.

925
01:04:56,056 --> 01:05:03,022
'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, andmy poor little reputation, such as it is,

926
01:05:03,022 --> 01:05:08,078
will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.Can you not find the advertisement, Mr.

927
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:10,021
Wilson?"

928
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:15,919
"Yes, I have got it now," he answered withhis thick red finger planted halfway down

929
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:18,579
the column."Here it is.

930
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:20,949
This is what began it all.

931
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:26,001
You just read it for yourself, sir."I took the paper from him and read as

932
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:27,006
follows:

933
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:34,269
"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account ofthe bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of

934
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:40,038
Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there isnow another vacancy open which entitles a

935
01:05:40,038 --> 01:05:46,081
member of the League to a salary of 4pounds a week for purely nominal services.

936
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:52,076
All red-headed men who are sound in bodyand mind and above the age of twenty-one

937
01:05:52,076 --> 01:05:54,054
years, are eligible.

938
01:05:54,054 --> 01:06:00,679
Apply in person on Monday, at eleveno'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of

939
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:07,819
the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street.""What on earth does this mean?"

940
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:13,058
I ejaculated after I had twice read overthe extraordinary announcement.

941
01:06:13,058 --> 01:06:18,009
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair,as was his habit when in high spirits.

942
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:23,045
"It is a little off the beaten track, isn'tit?" said he.

943
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:28,359
"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratchand tell us all about yourself, your

944
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:33,419
household, and the effect which thisadvertisement had upon your fortunes.

945
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:37,589
You will first make a note, Doctor, of thepaper and the date."

946
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:42,007
"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27,1890.

947
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:44,077
Just two months ago."

948
01:06:44,077 --> 01:06:49,359
"Very good.Now, Mr. Wilson?"

949
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:55,039
"Well, it is just as I have been tellingyou, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez

950
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:01,239
Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have asmall pawnbroker's business at Coburg

951
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:03,027
Square, near the City.

952
01:07:03,027 --> 01:07:09,008
It's not a very large affair, and of lateyears it has not done more than just give

953
01:07:09,008 --> 01:07:10,559
me a living.

954
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,032
I used to be able to keep two assistants,but now I only keep one; and I would have a

955
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:20,095
job to pay him but that he is willing tocome for half wages so as to learn the

956
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:22,999
business."

957
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:28,027
"What is the name of this obliging youth?"asked Sherlock Holmes.

958
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:33,239
"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he'snot such a youth, either.

959
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:35,729
It's hard to say his age.

960
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:40,649
I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.Holmes; and I know very well that he could

961
01:07:40,649 --> 01:07:44,058
better himself and earn twice what I amable to give him.

962
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:51,279
But, after all, if he is satisfied, whyshould I put ideas in his head?"

963
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:52,619
"Why, indeed?

964
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:57,002
You seem most fortunate in having anemployé who comes under the full market

965
01:07:57,002 --> 01:08:00,049
price.It is not a common experience among

966
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:02,339
employers in this age.

967
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:06,439
I don't know that your assistant is not asremarkable as your advertisement."

968
01:08:06,439 --> 01:08:12,309
"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr.Wilson.

969
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:15,057
"Never was such a fellow for photography.

970
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:20,489
Snapping away with a camera when he oughtto be improving his mind, and then diving

971
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:25,064
down into the cellar like a rabbit into itshole to develop his pictures.

972
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:30,026
That is his main fault, but on the wholehe's a good worker.

973
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:36,089
There's no vice in him.""He is still with you, I presume?"

974
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:37,039
"Yes, sir.

975
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:42,007
He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bitof simple cooking and keeps the place

976
01:08:42,007 --> 01:08:49,429
clean--that's all I have in the house, forI am a widower and never had any family.

977
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:54,529
We live very quietly, sir, the three of us;and we keep a roof over our heads and pay

978
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:59,609
our debts, if we do nothing more."The first thing that put us out was that

979
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:01,189
advertisement.

980
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:06,469
Spaulding, he came down into the officejust this day eight weeks, with this very

981
01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:12,529
paper in his hand, and he says:"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I

982
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:15,349
was a red-headed man.'

983
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:18,008
"'Why that?'I asks.

984
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:24,032
"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy onthe League of the Red-headed Men.

985
01:09:24,032 --> 01:09:28,979
It's worth quite a little fortune to anyman who gets it, and I understand that

986
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:33,719
there are more vacancies than there aremen, so that the trustees are at their

987
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,749
wits' end what to do with the money.

988
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:42,026
If my hair would only change colour, here'sa nice little crib all ready for me to step

989
01:09:42,026 --> 01:09:45,076
into.'"'Why, what is it, then?'

990
01:09:45,076 --> 01:09:46,929
I asked.

991
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:53,083
You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me

992
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:59,039
instead of my having to go to it, I wasoften weeks on end without putting my foot

993
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:00,969
over the door-mat.

994
01:10:00,969 --> 01:10:06,089
In that way I didn't know much of what wasgoing on outside, and I was always glad of

995
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:06,095
a bit of news.

996
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:13,002
"'Have you never heard of the League of theRed-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes

997
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:14,929
open."'Never.'

998
01:10:14,929 --> 01:10:20,599
"'Why, I wonder at that, for you areeligible yourself for one of the

999
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:24,359
vacancies.'"'And what are they worth?'

1000
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:25,629
I asked.

1001
01:10:25,629 --> 01:10:31,007
"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year,but the work is slight, and it need not

1002
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:35,209
interfere very much with one's otheroccupations.'

1003
01:10:35,209 --> 01:10:40,057
"Well, you can easily think that that mademe prick up my ears, for the business has

1004
01:10:40,057 --> 01:10:45,339
not been over-good for some years, and anextra couple of hundred would have been

1005
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:47,169
very handy.

1006
01:10:47,169 --> 01:10:50,359
"'Tell me all about it,' said I.

1007
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:55,052
"'Well,' said he, showing me theadvertisement, 'you can see for yourself

1008
01:10:55,052 --> 01:11:00,189
that the League has a vacancy, and there isthe address where you should apply for

1009
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,689
particulars.

1010
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:07,959
As far as I can make out, the League wasfounded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah

1011
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:11,057
Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.

1012
01:11:11,057 --> 01:11:18,014
He was himself red-headed, and he had agreat sympathy for all red-headed men; so

1013
01:11:18,014 --> 01:11:22,959
when he died it was found that he had lefthis enormous fortune in the hands of

1014
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:26,029
trustees, with instructions to apply the

1015
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:31,479
interest to the providing of easy berths tomen whose hair is of that colour.

1016
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:36,179
From all I hear it is splendid pay and verylittle to do.'

1017
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:42,279
"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions ofred-headed men who would apply.'

1018
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:45,919
"'Not so many as you might think,' heanswered.

1019
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:50,809
'You see it is really confined toLondoners, and to grown men.

1020
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:55,083
This American had started from London whenhe was young, and he wanted to do the old

1021
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:58,219
town a good turn.

1022
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:04,032
Then, again, I have heard it is no use yourapplying if your hair is light red, or dark

1023
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:09,679
red, or anything but real bright, blazing,fiery red.

1024
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:15,559
Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, youwould just walk in; but perhaps it would

1025
01:12:15,559 --> 01:12:19,379
hardly be worth your while to put yourselfout of the way for the sake of a few

1026
01:12:19,379 --> 01:12:21,669
hundred pounds.'

1027
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:27,839
"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you maysee for yourselves, that my hair is of a

1028
01:12:27,839 --> 01:12:32,076
very full and rich tint, so that it seemedto me that if there was to be any

1029
01:12:32,076 --> 01:12:39,189
competition in the matter I stood as good achance as any man that I had ever met.

1030
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:43,549
Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so muchabout it that I thought he might prove

1031
01:12:43,549 --> 01:12:49,619
useful, so I just ordered him to put up theshutters for the day and to come right away

1032
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:50,007
with me.

1033
01:12:50,007 --> 01:12:55,909
He was very willing to have a holiday, sowe shut the business up and started off for

1034
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:58,409
the address that was given us in theadvertisement.

1035
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:03,909
"I never hope to see such a sight as thatagain, Mr. Holmes.

1036
01:13:03,909 --> 01:13:09,529
From north, south, east, and west every manwho had a shade of red in his hair had

1037
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:13,729
tramped into the city to answer theadvertisement.

1038
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:18,209
Fleet Street was choked with red-headedfolk, and Pope's Court looked like a

1039
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:20,399
coster's orange barrow.

1040
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,989
I should not have thought there were somany in the whole country as were brought

1041
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:26,589
together by that single advertisement.

1042
01:13:26,589 --> 01:13:33,539
Every shade of colour they were--straw,lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver,

1043
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:39,359
clay; but, as Spaulding said, there werenot many who had the real vivid flame-

1044
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:40,959
coloured tint.

1045
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:46,049
When I saw how many were waiting, I wouldhave given it up in despair; but Spaulding

1046
01:13:46,049 --> 01:13:47,799
would not hear of it.

1047
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:53,149
How he did it I could not imagine, but hepushed and pulled and butted until he got

1048
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:58,289
me through the crowd, and right up to thesteps which led to the office.

1049
01:13:58,289 --> 01:14:03,879
There was a double stream upon the stair,some going up in hope, and some coming back

1050
01:14:03,879 --> 01:14:08,999
dejected; but we wedged in as well as wecould and soon found ourselves in the

1051
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:10,929
office."

1052
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:15,809
"Your experience has been a mostentertaining one," remarked Holmes as his

1053
01:14:15,809 --> 01:14:20,489
client paused and refreshed his memory witha huge pinch of snuff.

1054
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:24,869
"Pray continue your very interestingstatement."

1055
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:29,909
"There was nothing in the office but acouple of wooden chairs and a deal table,

1056
01:14:29,909 --> 01:14:34,749
behind which sat a small man with a headthat was even redder than mine.

1057
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:39,939
He said a few words to each candidate as hecame up, and then he always managed to find

1058
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:43,046
some fault in them which would disqualifythem.

1059
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:48,048
Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such avery easy matter, after all.

1060
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:54,009
However, when our turn came the little manwas much more favourable to me than to any

1061
01:14:54,009 --> 01:14:59,003
of the others, and he closed the door as weentered, so that he might have a private

1062
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:01,159
word with us.

1063
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:06,043
"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said myassistant, 'and he is willing to fill a

1064
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:11,859
vacancy in the League.'"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the

1065
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:13,399
other answered.

1066
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:17,023
'He has every requirement.I cannot recall when I have seen anything

1067
01:15:17,023 --> 01:15:19,033
so fine.'

1068
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:24,097
He took a step backward, cocked his head onone side, and gazed at my hair until I felt

1069
01:15:24,097 --> 01:15:26,529
quite bashful.

1070
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:32,003
Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung myhand, and congratulated me warmly on my

1071
01:15:32,003 --> 01:15:37,139
success."'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said

1072
01:15:37,139 --> 01:15:37,098
he.

1073
01:15:37,098 --> 01:15:44,019
'You will, however, I am sure, excuse mefor taking an obvious precaution.'

1074
01:15:44,019 --> 01:15:49,159
With that he seized my hair in both hishands, and tugged until I yelled with the

1075
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:50,899
pain.

1076
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:54,035
'There is water in your eyes,' said he ashe released me.

1077
01:15:54,035 --> 01:15:58,035
'I perceive that all is as it should be.

1078
01:15:58,035 --> 01:16:03,045
But we have to be careful, for we havetwice been deceived by wigs and once by

1079
01:16:03,045 --> 01:16:06,082
paint.I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax

1080
01:16:06,082 --> 01:16:10,379
which would disgust you with human nature.'

1081
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:14,389
He stepped over to the window and shoutedthrough it at the top of his voice that the

1082
01:16:14,389 --> 01:16:16,079
vacancy was filled.

1083
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:21,739
A groan of disappointment came up frombelow, and the folk all trooped away in

1084
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:26,989
different directions until there was not ared-head to be seen except my own and that

1085
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:28,098
of the manager.

1086
01:16:28,098 --> 01:16:35,008
"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross,and I am myself one of the pensioners upon

1087
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:41,085
the fund left by our noble benefactor.Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson?

1088
01:16:41,085 --> 01:16:42,092
Have you a family?'

1089
01:16:42,092 --> 01:16:49,139
"I answered that I had not."His face fell immediately.

1090
01:16:49,139 --> 01:16:53,095
"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is veryserious indeed!

1091
01:16:53,095 --> 01:16:57,068
I am sorry to hear you say that.

1092
01:16:57,068 --> 01:17:02,083
The fund was, of course, for thepropagation and spread of the red-heads as

1093
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:07,499
well as for their maintenance.It is exceedingly unfortunate that you

1094
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:08,047
should be a bachelor.'

1095
01:17:08,047 --> 01:17:14,889
"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes,for I thought that I was not to have the

1096
01:17:14,889 --> 01:17:19,609
vacancy after all; but after thinking itover for a few minutes he said that it

1097
01:17:19,609 --> 01:17:21,779
would be all right.

1098
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:27,359
"'In the case of another,' said he, 'theobjection might be fatal, but we must

1099
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:32,056
stretch a point in favour of a man withsuch a head of hair as yours.

1100
01:17:32,056 --> 01:17:36,042
When shall you be able to enter upon yournew duties?'

1101
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:42,002
"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I havea business already,' said I.

1102
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:47,259
"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!'said Vincent Spaulding.

1103
01:17:47,259 --> 01:17:51,004
'I should be able to look after that foryou.'

1104
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:52,006
"'What would be the hours?'

1105
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:56,129
I asked."'Ten to two.'

1106
01:17:56,129 --> 01:18:01,409
"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly doneof an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially

1107
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:06,007
Thursday and Friday evening, which is justbefore pay-day; so it would suit me very

1108
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:09,006
well to earn a little in the mornings.

1109
01:18:09,006 --> 01:18:13,999
Besides, I knew that my assistant was agood man, and that he would see to anything

1110
01:18:13,999 --> 01:18:19,021
that turned up."'That would suit me very well,' said I.

1111
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:21,269
'And the pay?'

1112
01:18:21,269 --> 01:18:26,269
"'Is 4 pounds a week.'"'And the work?'

1113
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:30,389
"'Is purely nominal.'"'What do you call purely nominal?'

1114
01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:37,002
"'Well, you have to be in the office, or atleast in the building, the whole time.

1115
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:41,009
If you leave, you forfeit your wholeposition forever.

1116
01:18:41,009 --> 01:18:44,269
The will is very clear upon that point.

1117
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:48,097
You don't comply with the conditions if youbudge from the office during that time.'

1118
01:18:48,097 --> 01:18:55,021
"'It's only four hours a day, and I shouldnot think of leaving,' said I.

1119
01:18:55,021 --> 01:19:01,008
"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. DuncanRoss; 'neither sickness nor business nor

1120
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:04,096
anything else.There you must stay, or you lose your

1121
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:06,097
billet.'

1122
01:19:06,097 --> 01:19:11,249
"'And the work?'"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia

1123
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:14,084
Britannica."There is the first volume of it in that

1124
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:15,094
press.

1125
01:19:15,094 --> 01:19:21,043
You must find your own ink, pens, andblotting-paper, but we provide this table

1126
01:19:21,043 --> 01:19:24,979
and chair.Will you be ready to-morrow?'

1127
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:27,779
"'Certainly,' I answered.

1128
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:33,399
"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and letme congratulate you once more on the

1129
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:38,359
important position which you have beenfortunate enough to gain.'

1130
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:42,082
He bowed me out of the room and I went homewith my assistant, hardly knowing what to

1131
01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:48,249
say or do, I was so pleased at my own goodfortune.

1132
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:54,499
"Well, I thought over the matter all day,and by evening I was in low spirits again;

1133
01:19:54,499 --> 01:19:59,017
for I had quite persuaded myself that thewhole affair must be some great hoax or

1134
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:04,008
fraud, though what its object might be Icould not imagine.

1135
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:08,096
It seemed altogether past belief thatanyone could make such a will, or that they

1136
01:20:08,096 --> 01:20:14,519
would pay such a sum for doing anything sosimple as copying out the 'Encyclopaedia

1137
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:16,034
Britannica.'

1138
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:22,009
Vincent Spaulding did what he could tocheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned

1139
01:20:22,009 --> 01:20:24,008
myself out of the whole thing.

1140
01:20:24,008 --> 01:20:29,022
However, in the morning I determined tohave a look at it anyhow, so I bought a

1141
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:34,409
penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen,and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I

1142
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:37,042
started off for Pope's Court.

1143
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:43,019
"Well, to my surprise and delight,everything was as right as possible.

1144
01:20:43,019 --> 01:20:48,004
The table was set out ready for me, and Mr.Duncan Ross was there to see that I got

1145
01:20:48,004 --> 01:20:49,058
fairly to work.

1146
01:20:49,058 --> 01:20:54,759
He started me off upon the letter A, andthen he left me; but he would drop in from

1147
01:20:54,759 --> 01:20:58,006
time to time to see that all was right withme.

1148
01:20:58,006 --> 01:21:03,057
At two o'clock he bade me good-day,complimented me upon the amount that I had

1149
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:07,999
written, and locked the door of the officeafter me.

1150
01:21:07,999 --> 01:21:13,759
"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes,and on Saturday the manager came in and

1151
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:18,045
planked down four golden sovereigns for myweek's work.

1152
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:22,094
It was the same next week, and the same theweek after.

1153
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:28,099
Every morning I was there at ten, and everyafternoon I left at two.

1154
01:21:28,099 --> 01:21:34,042
By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to comingin only once of a morning, and then, after

1155
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:37,029
a time, he did not come in at all.

1156
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:42,359
Still, of course, I never dared to leavethe room for an instant, for I was not sure

1157
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:48,003
when he might come, and the billet was sucha good one, and suited me so well, that I

1158
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:51,032
would not risk the loss of it.

1159
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:56,389
"Eight weeks passed away like this, and Ihad written about Abbots and Archery and

1160
01:21:56,389 --> 01:22:01,007
Armour and Architecture and Attica, andhoped with diligence that I might get on to

1161
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:04,021
the B's before very long.

1162
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:08,095
It cost me something in foolscap, and I hadpretty nearly filled a shelf with my

1163
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:12,739
writings.And then suddenly the whole business came

1164
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:14,007
to an end."

1165
01:22:14,007 --> 01:22:17,849
"To an end?""Yes, sir.

1166
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,099
And no later than this morning.

1167
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:25,619
I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock,but the door was shut and locked, with a

1168
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:30,109
little square of cardboard hammered on tothe middle of the panel with a tack.

1169
01:22:30,109 --> 01:22:34,021
Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

1170
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:39,008
He held up a piece of white cardboard aboutthe size of a sheet of note-paper.

1171
01:22:39,008 --> 01:22:42,047
It read in this fashion:THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

1172
01:22:42,047 --> 01:22:42,989
IS

1173
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:48,059
DISSOLVED.October 9, 1890.

1174
01:22:48,059 --> 01:22:53,003
Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curtannouncement and the rueful face behind it,

1175
01:22:53,003 --> 01:22:57,389
until the comical side of the affair socompletely overtopped every other

1176
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:04,045
consideration that we both burst out into aroar of laughter.

1177
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:09,059
"I cannot see that there is anything veryfunny," cried our client, flushing up to

1178
01:23:09,059 --> 01:23:11,989
the roots of his flaming head.

1179
01:23:11,989 --> 01:23:16,759
"If you can do nothing better than laugh atme, I can go elsewhere."

1180
01:23:16,759 --> 01:23:21,659
"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him backinto the chair from which he had half

1181
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:22,079
risen.

1182
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,729
"I really wouldn't miss your case for theworld.

1183
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:31,032
It is most refreshingly unusual.But there is, if you will excuse my saying

1184
01:23:31,032 --> 01:23:35,519
so, something just a little funny about it.

1185
01:23:35,519 --> 01:23:38,083
Pray what steps did you take when you foundthe card upon the door?"

1186
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:43,849
"I was staggered, sir.I did not know what to do.

1187
01:23:43,849 --> 01:23:48,979
Then I called at the offices round, butnone of them seemed to know anything about

1188
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:48,979
it.

1189
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:55,055
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is anaccountant living on the ground-floor, and

1190
01:23:55,055 --> 01:23:59,979
I asked him if he could tell me what hadbecome of the Red-headed League.

1191
01:23:59,979 --> 01:24:02,989
He said that he had never heard of any suchbody.

1192
01:24:02,989 --> 01:24:10,045
Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was.He answered that the name was new to him.

1193
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:14,899
"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

1194
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:18,989
"'What, the red-headed man?'"'Yes.'

1195
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:23,003
"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was WilliamMorris.

1196
01:24:23,003 --> 01:24:28,092
He was a solicitor and was using my room asa temporary convenience until his new

1197
01:24:28,092 --> 01:24:33,007
premises were ready.He moved out yesterday.'

1198
01:24:33,007 --> 01:24:35,379
"'Where could I find him?'

1199
01:24:35,379 --> 01:24:39,008
"'Oh, at his new offices.He did tell me the address.

1200
01:24:39,008 --> 01:24:46,029
Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St.Paul's.'

1201
01:24:46,029 --> 01:24:50,849
"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I gotto that address it was a manufactory of

1202
01:24:50,849 --> 01:24:56,509
artificial knee-caps, and no one in it hadever heard of either Mr. William Morris or

1203
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:59,032
Mr. Duncan Ross."

1204
01:24:59,032 --> 01:25:06,249
"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes."I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I

1205
01:25:06,249 --> 01:25:11,006
took the advice of my assistant.But he could not help me in any way.

1206
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:15,006
He could only say that if I waited I shouldhear by post.

1207
01:25:15,006 --> 01:25:18,032
But that was not quite good enough, Mr.Holmes.

1208
01:25:18,032 --> 01:25:23,659
I did not wish to lose such a place withouta struggle, so, as I had heard that you

1209
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:28,619
were good enough to give advice to poorfolk who were in need of it, I came right

1210
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:31,229
away to you."

1211
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:36,719
"And you did very wisely," said Holmes."Your case is an exceedingly remarkable

1212
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,099
one, and I shall be happy to look into it.

1213
01:25:40,099 --> 01:25:45,129
From what you have told me I think that itis possible that graver issues hang from it

1214
01:25:45,129 --> 01:25:51,031
than might at first sight appear.""Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson.

1215
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:55,008
"Why, I have lost four pound a week."

1216
01:25:55,008 --> 01:26:01,409
"As far as you are personally concerned,"remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you

1217
01:26:01,409 --> 01:26:05,009
have any grievance against thisextraordinary league.

1218
01:26:05,009 --> 01:26:11,054
On the contrary, you are, as I understand,richer by some 30 pounds, to say nothing of

1219
01:26:11,054 --> 01:26:15,043
the minute knowledge which you have gainedon every subject which comes under the

1220
01:26:15,043 --> 01:26:16,909
letter A.

1221
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:21,007
You have lost nothing by them.""No, sir.

1222
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:26,071
But I want to find out about them, and whothey are, and what their object was in

1223
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:31,046
playing this prank--if it was a prank--uponme.

1224
01:26:31,046 --> 01:26:37,909
It was a pretty expensive joke for them,for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

1225
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:41,099
"We shall endeavour to clear up thesepoints for you.

1226
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:44,909
And, first, one or two questions, Mr.Wilson.

1227
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:49,999
This assistant of yours who first calledyour attention to the advertisement--how

1228
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:50,979
long had he been with you?"

1229
01:26:50,979 --> 01:26:57,349
"About a month then.""How did he come?"

1230
01:26:57,349 --> 01:27:02,729
"In answer to an advertisement.""Was he the only applicant?"

1231
01:27:02,729 --> 01:27:04,082
"No, I had a dozen."

1232
01:27:04,082 --> 01:27:09,084
"Why did you pick him?""Because he was handy and would come

1233
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:13,093
cheap.""At half-wages, in fact."

1234
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:15,879
"Yes."

1235
01:27:15,879 --> 01:27:23,094
"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?""Small, stout-built, very quick in his

1236
01:27:23,094 --> 01:27:27,058
ways, no hair on his face, though he's notshort of thirty.

1237
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:33,489
Has a white splash of acid upon hisforehead."

1238
01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:36,009
Holmes sat up in his chair in considerableexcitement.

1239
01:27:36,009 --> 01:27:39,859
"I thought as much," said he.

1240
01:27:39,859 --> 01:27:44,409
"Have you ever observed that his ears arepierced for earrings?"

1241
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:48,239
"Yes, sir.He told me that a gipsy had done it for him

1242
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,899
when he was a lad."

1243
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:55,159
"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deepthought.

1244
01:27:55,159 --> 01:28:01,869
"He is still with you?""Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

1245
01:28:01,869 --> 01:28:05,759
"And has your business been attended to inyour absence?"

1246
01:28:05,759 --> 01:28:10,359
"Nothing to complain of, sir.There's never very much to do of a

1247
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:11,042
morning."

1248
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:15,093
"That will do, Mr. Wilson.I shall be happy to give you an opinion

1249
01:28:15,093 --> 01:28:19,129
upon the subject in the course of a day ortwo.

1250
01:28:19,129 --> 01:28:26,129
To-day is Saturday, and I hope that byMonday we may come to a conclusion."

1251
01:28:26,129 --> 01:28:31,089
"Well, Watson," said Holmes when ourvisitor had left us, "what do you make of

1252
01:28:31,089 --> 01:28:32,639
it all?"

1253
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:39,879
"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly."It is a most mysterious business."

1254
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:45,969
"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarrea thing is the less mysterious it proves to

1255
01:28:45,969 --> 01:28:46,096
be.

1256
01:28:46,096 --> 01:28:51,043
It is your commonplace, featureless crimeswhich are really puzzling, just as a

1257
01:28:51,043 --> 01:28:55,279
commonplace face is the most difficult toidentify.

1258
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:56,092
But I must be prompt over this matter."

1259
01:28:56,092 --> 01:29:01,071
"What are you going to do, then?"I asked.

1260
01:29:01,071 --> 01:29:04,259
"To smoke," he answered.

1261
01:29:04,259 --> 01:29:08,969
"It is quite a three pipe problem, and Ibeg that you won't speak to me for fifty

1262
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:09,389
minutes."

1263
01:29:09,389 --> 01:29:16,033
He curled himself up in his chair, with histhin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose,

1264
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:21,629
and there he sat with his eyes closed andhis black clay pipe thrusting out like the

1265
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:24,003
bill of some strange bird.

1266
01:29:24,003 --> 01:29:28,969
I had come to the conclusion that he haddropped asleep, and indeed was nodding

1267
01:29:28,969 --> 01:29:33,093
myself, when he suddenly sprang out of hischair with the gesture of a man who has

1268
01:29:33,093 --> 01:29:37,042
made up his mind and put his pipe down uponthe mantelpiece.

1269
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:44,229
"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hallthis afternoon," he remarked.

1270
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:45,081
"What do you think, Watson?

1271
01:29:45,081 --> 01:29:49,021
Could your patients spare you for a fewhours?"

1272
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:54,079
"I have nothing to do to-day.My practice is never very absorbing."

1273
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,869
"Then put on your hat and come.

1274
01:29:56,869 --> 01:30:01,239
I am going through the City first, and wecan have some lunch on the way.

1275
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:05,054
I observe that there is a good deal ofGerman music on the programme, which is

1276
01:30:05,054 --> 01:30:09,018
rather more to my taste than Italian orFrench.

1277
01:30:09,018 --> 01:30:12,969
It is introspective, and I want tointrospect.

1278
01:30:12,969 --> 01:30:15,149
Come along!"

1279
01:30:15,149 --> 01:30:19,095
We travelled by the Underground as far asAldersgate; and a short walk took us to

1280
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:24,081
Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of thesingular story which we had listened to in

1281
01:30:24,081 --> 01:30:26,008
the morning.

1282
01:30:26,008 --> 01:30:31,879
It was a poky, little, shabby-genteelplace, where four lines of dingy two-

1283
01:30:31,879 --> 01:30:37,043
storied brick houses looked out into asmall railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of

1284
01:30:37,043 --> 01:30:39,069
weedy grass and a few clumps of faded

1285
01:30:39,069 --> 01:30:46,149
laurel-bushes made a hard fight against asmoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.

1286
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:51,239
Three gilt balls and a brown board with"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a

1287
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:56,083
corner house, announced the place where ourred-headed client carried on his business.

1288
01:30:56,083 --> 01:31:00,619
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it withhis head on one side and looked it all

1289
01:31:00,619 --> 01:31:04,083
over, with his eyes shining brightlybetween puckered lids.

1290
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:10,044
Then he walked slowly up the street, andthen down again to the corner, still

1291
01:31:10,044 --> 01:31:13,004
looking keenly at the houses.

1292
01:31:13,004 --> 01:31:18,019
Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's,and, having thumped vigorously upon the

1293
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:23,379
pavement with his stick two or three times,he went up to the door and knocked.

1294
01:31:23,379 --> 01:31:27,096
It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who

1295
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:30,029
asked him to step in.

1296
01:31:30,029 --> 01:31:36,249
"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished toask you how you would go from here to the

1297
01:31:36,249 --> 01:31:40,499
Strand.""Third right, fourth left," answered the

1298
01:31:40,499 --> 01:31:44,209
assistant promptly, closing the door.

1299
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:48,055
"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as wewalked away.

1300
01:31:48,055 --> 01:31:53,929
"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartestman in London, and for daring I am not sure

1301
01:31:53,929 --> 01:31:56,669
that he has not a claim to be third.

1302
01:31:56,669 --> 01:32:02,749
I have known something of him before.""Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's

1303
01:32:02,749 --> 01:32:07,529
assistant counts for a good deal in thismystery of the Red-headed League.

1304
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:12,239
I am sure that you inquired your way merelyin order that you might see him."

1305
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:15,449
"Not him.""What then?"

1306
01:32:15,449 --> 01:32:18,719
"The knees of his trousers."

1307
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,061
"And what did you see?""What I expected to see."

1308
01:32:23,061 --> 01:32:28,064
"Why did you beat the pavement?""My dear doctor, this is a time for

1309
01:32:28,064 --> 01:32:30,909
observation, not for talk.

1310
01:32:30,909 --> 01:32:36,709
We are spies in an enemy's country.We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.

1311
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:41,083
Let us now explore the parts which liebehind it."

1312
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:46,159
The road in which we found ourselves as weturned round the corner from the retired

1313
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:51,909
Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great acontrast to it as the front of a picture

1314
01:32:51,909 --> 01:32:53,083
does to the back.

1315
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:57,006
It was one of the main arteries whichconveyed the traffic of the City to the

1316
01:32:57,006 --> 01:32:59,409
north and west.

1317
01:32:59,409 --> 01:33:03,049
The roadway was blocked with the immensestream of commerce flowing in a double tide

1318
01:33:03,049 --> 01:33:08,012
inward and outward, while the footpathswere black with the hurrying swarm of

1319
01:33:08,012 --> 01:33:09,083
pedestrians.

1320
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:15,031
It was difficult to realise as we looked atthe line of fine shops and stately business

1321
01:33:15,031 --> 01:33:20,061
premises that they really abutted on theother side upon the faded and stagnant

1322
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:22,063
square which we had just quitted.

1323
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:30,001
"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at thecorner and glancing along the line, "I

1324
01:33:30,001 --> 01:33:33,083
should like just to remember the order ofthe houses here.

1325
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:38,062
It is a hobby of mine to have an exactknowledge of London.

1326
01:33:38,062 --> 01:33:42,028
There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, thelittle newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of

1327
01:33:42,028 --> 01:33:48,001
the City and Suburban Bank, the VegetarianRestaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-

1328
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:49,054
building depot.

1329
01:33:49,054 --> 01:33:52,032
That carries us right on to the otherblock.

1330
01:33:52,032 --> 01:33:56,081
And now, Doctor, we've done our work, soit's time we had some play.

1331
01:33:56,081 --> 01:34:01,899
A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and thenoff to violin-land, where all is sweetness

1332
01:34:01,899 --> 01:34:06,689
and delicacy and harmony, and there are nored-headed clients to vex us with their

1333
01:34:06,689 --> 01:34:08,008
conundrums."

1334
01:34:08,008 --> 01:34:13,939
My friend was an enthusiastic musician,being himself not only a very capable

1335
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:18,032
performer but a composer of no ordinarymerit.

1336
01:34:18,032 --> 01:34:23,048
All the afternoon he sat in the stallswrapped in the most perfect happiness,

1337
01:34:23,048 --> 01:34:28,929
gently waving his long, thin fingers intime to the music, while his gently smiling

1338
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:31,088
face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as

1339
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:37,939
unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound,Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-

1340
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:43,006
handed criminal agent, as it was possibleto conceive.

1341
01:34:43,006 --> 01:34:48,031
In his singular character the dual naturealternately asserted itself, and his

1342
01:34:48,031 --> 01:34:53,052
extreme exactness and astutenessrepresented, as I have often thought, the

1343
01:34:53,052 --> 01:34:55,399
reaction against the poetic and

1344
01:34:55,399 --> 01:35:00,013
contemplative mood which occasionallypredominated in him.

1345
01:35:00,013 --> 01:35:05,006
The swing of his nature took him fromextreme languor to devouring energy; and,

1346
01:35:05,006 --> 01:35:12,149
as I knew well, he was never so trulyformidable as when, for days on end, he had

1347
01:35:12,149 --> 01:35:14,005
been lounging in his armchair amid his

1348
01:35:14,005 --> 01:35:18,014
improvisations and his black-lettereditions.

1349
01:35:18,014 --> 01:35:23,159
Then it was that the lust of the chasewould suddenly come upon him, and that his

1350
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:28,033
brilliant reasoning power would rise to thelevel of intuition, until those who were

1351
01:35:28,033 --> 01:35:30,075
unacquainted with his methods would look

1352
01:35:30,075 --> 01:35:36,038
askance at him as on a man whose knowledgewas not that of other mortals.

1353
01:35:36,038 --> 01:35:42,051
When I saw him that afternoon so enwrappedin the music at St. James's Hall I felt

1354
01:35:42,051 --> 01:35:49,036
that an evil time might be coming uponthose whom he had set himself to hunt down.

1355
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:55,011
"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," heremarked as we emerged.

1356
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:59,081
"Yes, it would be as well.""And I have some business to do which will

1357
01:35:59,081 --> 01:36:01,039
take some hours.

1358
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:07,048
This business at Coburg Square is serious.""Why serious?"

1359
01:36:07,048 --> 01:36:12,689
"A considerable crime is in contemplation.I have every reason to believe that we

1360
01:36:12,689 --> 01:36:15,009
shall be in time to stop it.

1361
01:36:15,009 --> 01:36:18,649
But to-day being Saturday rathercomplicates matters.

1362
01:36:18,649 --> 01:36:23,005
I shall want your help to-night.""At what time?"

1363
01:36:23,005 --> 01:36:25,219
"Ten will be early enough."

1364
01:36:25,219 --> 01:36:30,189
"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.""Very well.

1365
01:36:30,189 --> 01:36:35,051
And, I say, Doctor, there may be somelittle danger, so kindly put your army

1366
01:36:35,051 --> 01:36:38,011
revolver in your pocket."

1367
01:36:38,011 --> 01:36:44,709
He waved his hand, turned on his heel, anddisappeared in an instant among the crowd.

1368
01:36:44,709 --> 01:36:49,149
I trust that I am not more dense than myneighbours, but I was always oppressed with

1369
01:36:49,149 --> 01:36:53,036
a sense of my own stupidity in my dealingswith Sherlock Holmes.

1370
01:36:53,036 --> 01:36:59,034
Here I had heard what he had heard, I hadseen what he had seen, and yet from his

1371
01:36:59,034 --> 01:37:04,057
words it was evident that he saw clearlynot only what had happened but what was

1372
01:37:04,057 --> 01:37:11,083
about to happen, while to me the wholebusiness was still confused and grotesque.

1373
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:17,061
As I drove home to my house in Kensington Ithought over it all, from the extraordinary

1374
01:37:17,061 --> 01:37:23,169
story of the red-headed copier of the"Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-

1375
01:37:23,169 --> 01:37:28,439
Coburg Square, and the ominous words withwhich he had parted from me.

1376
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:34,399
What was this nocturnal expedition, and whyshould I go armed?

1377
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:37,008
Where were we going, and what were we todo?

1378
01:37:37,008 --> 01:37:42,083
I had the hint from Holmes that thissmooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a

1379
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:47,051
formidable man--a man who might play a deepgame.

1380
01:37:47,051 --> 01:37:53,219
I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up indespair and set the matter aside until

1381
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:57,009
night should bring an explanation.

1382
01:37:57,009 --> 01:38:01,699
It was a quarter-past nine when I startedfrom home and made my way across the Park,

1383
01:38:01,699 --> 01:38:04,086
and so through Oxford Street to BakerStreet.

1384
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:09,058
Two hansoms were standing at the door, andas I entered the passage I heard the sound

1385
01:38:09,058 --> 01:38:11,076
of voices from above.

1386
01:38:11,076 --> 01:38:17,074
On entering his room I found Holmes inanimated conversation with two men, one of

1387
01:38:17,074 --> 01:38:23,057
whom I recognised as Peter Jones, theofficial police agent, while the other was

1388
01:38:23,057 --> 01:38:26,083
a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very

1389
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:31,031
shiny hat and oppressively respectablefrock-coat.

1390
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:32,001
"Ha!

1391
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:37,081
Our party is complete," said Holmes,buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his

1392
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:42,077
heavy hunting crop from the rack."Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of

1393
01:38:42,077 --> 01:38:44,037
Scotland Yard?

1394
01:38:44,037 --> 01:38:49,649
Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather,who is to be our companion in to-night's

1395
01:38:49,649 --> 01:38:51,169
adventure."

1396
01:38:51,169 --> 01:38:56,199
"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor,you see," said Jones in his consequential

1397
01:38:56,199 --> 01:38:59,035
way."Our friend here is a wonderful man for

1398
01:38:59,035 --> 01:39:01,011
starting a chase.

1399
01:39:01,011 --> 01:39:06,003
All he wants is an old dog to help him todo the running down."

1400
01:39:06,003 --> 01:39:12,002
"I hope a wild goose may not prove to bethe end of our chase," observed Mr.

1401
01:39:12,002 --> 01:39:13,939
Merryweather gloomily.

1402
01:39:13,939 --> 01:39:19,001
"You may place considerable confidence inMr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent

1403
01:39:19,001 --> 01:39:20,409
loftily.

1404
01:39:20,409 --> 01:39:26,011
"He has his own little methods, which are,if he won't mind my saying so, just a

1405
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:31,088
little too theoretical and fantastic, buthe has the makings of a detective in him.

1406
01:39:31,088 --> 01:39:36,969
It is not too much to say that once ortwice, as in that business of the Sholto

1407
01:39:36,969 --> 01:39:41,649
murder and the Agra treasure, he has beenmore nearly correct than the official

1408
01:39:41,649 --> 01:39:41,949
force."

1409
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:49,049
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is allright," said the stranger with deference.

1410
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:52,049
"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.

1411
01:39:52,049 --> 01:39:56,709
It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my

1412
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:58,037
rubber."

1413
01:39:58,037 --> 01:40:03,003
"I think you will find," said SherlockHolmes, "that you will play for a higher

1414
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:08,939
stake to-night than you have ever done yet,and that the play will be more exciting.

1415
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:15,909
For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake willbe some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones,

1416
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:20,199
it will be the man upon whom you wish tolay your hands."

1417
01:40:20,199 --> 01:40:24,679
"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher,and forger.

1418
01:40:24,679 --> 01:40:29,082
He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but heis at the head of his profession, and I

1419
01:40:29,082 --> 01:40:34,062
would rather have my bracelets on him thanon any criminal in London.

1420
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:37,949
He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay.

1421
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:43,053
His grandfather was a royal duke, and hehimself has been to Eton and Oxford.

1422
01:40:43,053 --> 01:40:49,035
His brain is as cunning as his fingers, andthough we meet signs of him at every turn,

1423
01:40:49,035 --> 01:40:52,179
we never know where to find the manhimself.

1424
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:56,909
He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,and be raising money to build an orphanage

1425
01:40:56,909 --> 01:41:01,449
in Cornwall the next.I've been on his track for years and have

1426
01:41:01,449 --> 01:41:02,059
never set eyes on him yet."

1427
01:41:02,059 --> 01:41:07,055
"I hope that I may have the pleasure ofintroducing you to-night.

1428
01:41:07,055 --> 01:41:13,002
I've had one or two little turns also withMr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he

1429
01:41:13,002 --> 01:41:15,639
is at the head of his profession.

1430
01:41:15,639 --> 01:41:19,059
It is past ten, however, and quite timethat we started.

1431
01:41:19,059 --> 01:41:25,079
If you two will take the first hansom,Watson and I will follow in the second."

1432
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:29,959
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicativeduring the long drive and lay back in the

1433
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:33,909
cab humming the tunes which he had heard inthe afternoon.

1434
01:41:33,909 --> 01:41:38,079
We rattled through an endless labyrinth ofgas-lit streets until we emerged into

1435
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:43,059
Farrington Street."We are close there now," my friend

1436
01:41:43,059 --> 01:41:44,008
remarked.

1437
01:41:44,008 --> 01:41:49,048
"This fellow Merryweather is a bankdirector, and personally interested in the

1438
01:41:49,048 --> 01:41:52,077
matter.I thought it as well to have Jones with us

1439
01:41:52,077 --> 01:41:53,949
also.

1440
01:41:53,949 --> 01:41:59,199
He is not a bad fellow, though an absoluteimbecile in his profession.

1441
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,449
He has one positive virtue.

1442
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:06,032
He is as brave as a bulldog and astenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws

1443
01:42:06,032 --> 01:42:12,029
upon anyone.Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

1444
01:42:12,029 --> 01:42:15,053
We had reached the same crowdedthoroughfare in which we had found

1445
01:42:15,053 --> 01:42:17,459
ourselves in the morning.

1446
01:42:17,459 --> 01:42:22,929
Our cabs were dismissed, and, following theguidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed

1447
01:42:22,929 --> 01:42:27,469
down a narrow passage and through a sidedoor, which he opened for us.

1448
01:42:27,469 --> 01:42:32,038
Within there was a small corridor, whichended in a very massive iron gate.

1449
01:42:32,038 --> 01:42:38,419
This also was opened, and led down a flightof winding stone steps, which terminated at

1450
01:42:38,419 --> 01:42:40,061
another formidable gate.

1451
01:42:40,061 --> 01:42:45,149
Mr. Merryweather stopped to light alantern, and then conducted us down a dark,

1452
01:42:45,149 --> 01:42:51,031
earth-smelling passage, and so, afteropening a third door, into a huge vault or

1453
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:56,055
cellar, which was piled all round withcrates and massive boxes.

1454
01:42:56,055 --> 01:43:01,419
"You are not very vulnerable from above,"Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern

1455
01:43:01,419 --> 01:43:03,087
and gazed about him.

1456
01:43:03,087 --> 01:43:08,082
"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather,striking his stick upon the flags which

1457
01:43:08,082 --> 01:43:13,949
lined the floor."Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he

1458
01:43:13,949 --> 01:43:17,000
remarked, looking up in surprise.

1459
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,159
"I must really ask you to be a little morequiet!" said Holmes severely.

1460
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:26,459
"You have already imperilled the wholesuccess of our expedition.

1461
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:30,054
Might I beg that you would have thegoodness to sit down upon one of those

1462
01:43:30,054 --> 01:43:33,085
boxes, and not to interfere?"

1463
01:43:33,085 --> 01:43:38,419
The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himselfupon a crate, with a very injured

1464
01:43:38,419 --> 01:43:44,024
expression upon his face, while Holmes fellupon his knees upon the floor and, with the

1465
01:43:44,024 --> 01:43:46,939
lantern and a magnifying lens, began to

1466
01:43:46,939 --> 01:43:50,062
examine minutely the cracks between thestones.

1467
01:43:50,062 --> 01:43:55,056
A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, forhe sprang to his feet again and put his

1468
01:43:55,056 --> 01:43:58,023
glass in his pocket.

1469
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:03,002
"We have at least an hour before us," heremarked, "for they can hardly take any

1470
01:44:03,002 --> 01:44:06,074
steps until the good pawnbroker is safelyin bed.

1471
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:10,098
Then they will not lose a minute, for thesooner they do their work the longer time

1472
01:44:10,098 --> 01:44:13,011
they will have for their escape.

1473
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:18,098
We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt youhave divined--in the cellar of the City

1474
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:22,709
branch of one of the principal Londonbanks.

1475
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:27,005
Mr. Merryweather is the chairman ofdirectors, and he will explain to you that

1476
01:44:27,005 --> 01:44:31,419
there are reasons why the more daringcriminals of London should take a

1477
01:44:31,419 --> 01:44:34,219
considerable interest in this cellar atpresent."

1478
01:44:34,219 --> 01:44:40,000
"It is our French gold," whispered thedirector.

1479
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,199
"We have had several warnings that anattempt might be made upon it."

1480
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:47,179
"Your French gold?"

1481
01:44:47,179 --> 01:44:52,098
"Yes. We had occasion some months ago tostrengthen our resources and borrowed for

1482
01:44:52,098 --> 01:44:57,379
that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bankof France.

1483
01:44:57,379 --> 01:45:02,027
It has become known that we have never hadoccasion to unpack the money, and that it

1484
01:45:02,027 --> 01:45:04,919
is still lying in our cellar.

1485
01:45:04,919 --> 01:45:09,075
The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000napoleons packed between layers of lead

1486
01:45:09,075 --> 01:45:10,051
foil.

1487
01:45:10,051 --> 01:45:16,001
Our reserve of bullion is much larger atpresent than is usually kept in a single

1488
01:45:16,001 --> 01:45:22,005
branch office, and the directors have hadmisgivings upon the subject."

1489
01:45:22,005 --> 01:45:26,012
"Which were very well justified," observedHolmes.

1490
01:45:26,012 --> 01:45:29,909
"And now it is time that we arranged ourlittle plans.

1491
01:45:29,909 --> 01:45:34,006
I expect that within an hour matters willcome to a head.

1492
01:45:34,006 --> 01:45:40,028
In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we mustput the screen over that dark lantern."

1493
01:45:40,028 --> 01:45:42,429
"And sit in the dark?"

1494
01:45:42,429 --> 01:45:46,679
"I am afraid so.I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket,

1495
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:52,011
and I thought that, as we were a partiecarrée, you might have your rubber after

1496
01:45:52,011 --> 01:45:53,003
all.

1497
01:45:53,003 --> 01:45:58,008
But I see that the enemy's preparationshave gone so far that we cannot risk the

1498
01:45:58,008 --> 01:46:02,075
presence of a light.And, first of all, we must choose our

1499
01:46:02,075 --> 01:46:04,005
positions.

1500
01:46:04,005 --> 01:46:09,209
These are daring men, and though we shalltake them at a disadvantage, they may do us

1501
01:46:09,209 --> 01:46:15,006
some harm unless we are careful.I shall stand behind this crate, and do you

1502
01:46:15,006 --> 01:46:17,086
conceal yourselves behind those.

1503
01:46:17,086 --> 01:46:22,399
Then, when I flash a light upon them, closein swiftly.

1504
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:26,389
If they fire, Watson, have no compunctionabout shooting them down."

1505
01:46:26,389 --> 01:46:34,031
I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the topof the wooden case behind which I crouched.

1506
01:46:34,031 --> 01:46:39,449
Holmes shot the slide across the front ofhis lantern and left us in pitch darkness--

1507
01:46:39,449 --> 01:46:44,029
such an absolute darkness as I have neverbefore experienced.

1508
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:49,189
The smell of hot metal remained to assureus that the light was still there, ready to

1509
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:51,084
flash out at a moment's notice.

1510
01:46:51,084 --> 01:46:56,074
To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitchof expectancy, there was something

1511
01:46:56,074 --> 01:47:02,409
depressing and subduing in the suddengloom, and in the cold dank air of the

1512
01:47:02,409 --> 01:47:03,649
vault.

1513
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:08,129
"They have but one retreat," whisperedHolmes.

1514
01:47:08,129 --> 01:47:11,023
"That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square.

1515
01:47:11,023 --> 01:47:15,083
I hope that you have done what I asked you,Jones?"

1516
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:20,469
"I have an inspector and two officerswaiting at the front door."

1517
01:47:20,469 --> 01:47:23,001
"Then we have stopped all the holes.

1518
01:47:23,001 --> 01:47:29,052
And now we must be silent and wait."What a time it seemed!

1519
01:47:29,052 --> 01:47:34,054
From comparing notes afterwards it was butan hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to

1520
01:47:34,054 --> 01:47:40,006
me that the night must have almost gone andthe dawn be breaking above us.

1521
01:47:40,006 --> 01:47:46,011
My limbs were weary and stiff, for I fearedto change my position; yet my nerves were

1522
01:47:46,011 --> 01:47:51,056
worked up to the highest pitch of tension,and my hearing was so acute that I could

1523
01:47:51,056 --> 01:47:54,001
not only hear the gentle breathing of my

1524
01:47:54,001 --> 01:47:58,399
companions, but I could distinguish thedeeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky

1525
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:02,086
Jones from the thin, sighing note of thebank director.

1526
01:48:02,086 --> 01:48:07,439
From my position I could look over the casein the direction of the floor.

1527
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,059
Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of alight.

1528
01:48:11,059 --> 01:48:15,959
At first it was but a lurid spark upon thestone pavement.

1529
01:48:15,959 --> 01:48:21,001
Then it lengthened out until it became ayellow line, and then, without any warning

1530
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:28,062
or sound, a gash seemed to open and a handappeared, a white, almost womanly hand,

1531
01:48:28,062 --> 01:48:33,024
which felt about in the centre of thelittle area of light.

1532
01:48:33,024 --> 01:48:37,889
For a minute or more the hand, with itswrithing fingers, protruded out of the

1533
01:48:37,889 --> 01:48:39,012
floor.

1534
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:44,026
Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as itappeared, and all was dark again save the

1535
01:48:44,026 --> 01:48:49,011
single lurid spark which marked a chinkbetween the stones.

1536
01:48:49,011 --> 01:48:52,469
Its disappearance, however, was butmomentary.

1537
01:48:52,469 --> 01:48:57,099
With a rending, tearing sound, one of thebroad, white stones turned over upon its

1538
01:48:57,099 --> 01:49:02,053
side and left a square, gaping hole,through which streamed the light of a

1539
01:49:02,053 --> 01:49:03,081
lantern.

1540
01:49:03,081 --> 01:49:09,078
Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,boyish face, which looked keenly about it,

1541
01:49:09,078 --> 01:49:15,029
and then, with a hand on either side of theaperture, drew itself shoulder-high and

1542
01:49:15,029 --> 01:49:19,058
waist-high, until one knee rested upon theedge.

1543
01:49:19,058 --> 01:49:23,082
In another instant he stood at the side ofthe hole and was hauling after him a

1544
01:49:23,082 --> 01:49:30,469
companion, lithe and small like himself,with a pale face and a shock of very red

1545
01:49:30,469 --> 01:49:30,062
hair.

1546
01:49:30,062 --> 01:49:37,082
"It's all clear," he whispered."Have you the chisel and the bags?

1547
01:49:37,082 --> 01:49:42,649
Great Scott!Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

1548
01:49:42,649 --> 01:49:46,085
Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seizedthe intruder by the collar.

1549
01:49:46,085 --> 01:49:51,149
The other dived down the hole, and I heardthe sound of rending cloth as Jones

1550
01:49:51,149 --> 01:49:52,959
clutched at his skirts.

1551
01:49:52,959 --> 01:49:57,035
The light flashed upon the barrel of arevolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came

1552
01:49:57,035 --> 01:50:01,005
down on the man's wrist, and the pistolclinked upon the stone floor.

1553
01:50:01,005 --> 01:50:06,129
"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmesblandly.

1554
01:50:06,129 --> 01:50:11,429
"You have no chance at all.""So I see," the other answered with the

1555
01:50:11,429 --> 01:50:13,028
utmost coolness.

1556
01:50:13,028 --> 01:50:18,003
"I fancy that my pal is all right, though Isee you have got his coat-tails."

1557
01:50:18,003 --> 01:50:22,149
"There are three men waiting for him at thedoor," said Holmes.

1558
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:24,889
"Oh, indeed!

1559
01:50:24,889 --> 01:50:27,409
You seem to have done the thing verycompletely.

1560
01:50:27,409 --> 01:50:32,439
I must compliment you.""And I you," Holmes answered.

1561
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:37,026
"Your red-headed idea was very new andeffective."

1562
01:50:37,026 --> 01:50:41,035
"You'll see your pal again presently," saidJones.

1563
01:50:41,035 --> 01:50:44,689
"He's quicker at climbing down holes than Iam.

1564
01:50:44,689 --> 01:50:47,699
Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

1565
01:50:47,699 --> 01:50:52,899
"I beg that you will not touch me with yourfilthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the

1566
01:50:52,899 --> 01:50:57,169
handcuffs clattered upon his wrists."You may not be aware that I have royal

1567
01:50:57,169 --> 01:50:58,076
blood in my veins.

1568
01:50:58,076 --> 01:51:04,049
Have the goodness, also, when you addressme always to say 'sir' and 'please.'"

1569
01:51:04,049 --> 01:51:10,003
"All right," said Jones with a stare and asnigger.

1570
01:51:10,003 --> 01:51:15,889
"Well, would you please, sir, marchupstairs, where we can get a cab to carry

1571
01:51:15,889 --> 01:51:23,449
your Highness to the police-station?""That is better," said John Clay serenely.

1572
01:51:23,449 --> 01:51:27,709
He made a sweeping bow to the three of usand walked quietly off in the custody of

1573
01:51:27,709 --> 01:51:30,409
the detective.

1574
01:51:30,409 --> 01:51:35,969
"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweatheras we followed them from the cellar, "I do

1575
01:51:35,969 --> 01:51:39,008
not know how the bank can thank you orrepay you.

1576
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:44,074
There is no doubt that you have detectedand defeated in the most complete manner

1577
01:51:44,074 --> 01:51:49,059
one of the most determined attempts at bankrobbery that have ever come within my

1578
01:51:49,059 --> 01:51:51,699
experience."

1579
01:51:51,699 --> 01:51:57,057
"I have had one or two little scores of myown to settle with Mr. John Clay," said

1580
01:51:57,057 --> 01:51:57,082
Holmes.

1581
01:51:57,082 --> 01:52:03,056
"I have been at some small expense overthis matter, which I shall expect the bank

1582
01:52:03,056 --> 01:52:09,023
to refund, but beyond that I am amplyrepaid by having had an experience which is

1583
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:11,078
in many ways unique, and by hearing the

1584
01:52:11,078 --> 01:52:16,899
very remarkable narrative of the Red-headedLeague."

1585
01:52:16,899 --> 01:52:21,949
"You see, Watson," he explained in theearly hours of the morning as we sat over a

1586
01:52:21,949 --> 01:52:27,061
glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street,"it was perfectly obvious from the first

1587
01:52:27,061 --> 01:52:29,077
that the only possible object of this

1588
01:52:29,077 --> 01:52:33,939
rather fantastic business of theadvertisement of the League, and the

1589
01:52:33,939 --> 01:52:40,005
copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be toget this not over-bright pawnbroker out of

1590
01:52:40,005 --> 01:52:43,034
the way for a number of hours every day.

1591
01:52:43,034 --> 01:52:49,005
It was a curious way of managing it, but,really, it would be difficult to suggest a

1592
01:52:49,005 --> 01:52:50,199
better.

1593
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:54,078
The method was no doubt suggested to Clay'singenious mind by the colour of his

1594
01:52:54,078 --> 01:52:56,076
accomplice's hair.

1595
01:52:56,076 --> 01:53:01,939
The 4 pounds a week was a lure which mustdraw him, and what was it to them, who were

1596
01:53:01,939 --> 01:53:04,000
playing for thousands?

1597
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,029
They put in the advertisement, one roguehas the temporary office, the other rogue

1598
01:53:09,029 --> 01:53:14,939
incites the man to apply for it, andtogether they manage to secure his absence

1599
01:53:14,939 --> 01:53:16,969
every morning in the week.

1600
01:53:16,969 --> 01:53:21,939
From the time that I heard of the assistanthaving come for half wages, it was obvious

1601
01:53:21,939 --> 01:53:27,639
to me that he had some strong motive forsecuring the situation."

1602
01:53:27,639 --> 01:53:30,005
"But how could you guess what the motivewas?"

1603
01:53:30,005 --> 01:53:35,459
"Had there been women in the house, Ishould have suspected a mere vulgar

1604
01:53:35,459 --> 01:53:36,008
intrigue.

1605
01:53:36,008 --> 01:53:42,006
That, however, was out of the question.The man's business was a small one, and

1606
01:53:42,006 --> 01:53:46,057
there was nothing in his house which couldaccount for such elaborate preparations,

1607
01:53:46,057 --> 01:53:49,709
and such an expenditure as they were at.

1608
01:53:49,709 --> 01:53:52,869
It must, then, be something out of thehouse.

1609
01:53:52,869 --> 01:53:54,449
What could it be?

1610
01:53:54,449 --> 01:53:59,139
I thought of the assistant's fondness forphotography, and his trick of vanishing

1611
01:53:59,139 --> 01:54:02,002
into the cellar.The cellar!

1612
01:54:02,002 --> 01:54:04,889
There was the end of this tangled clue.

1613
01:54:04,889 --> 01:54:10,209
Then I made inquiries as to this mysteriousassistant and found that I had to deal with

1614
01:54:10,209 --> 01:54:15,619
one of the coolest and most daringcriminals in London.

1615
01:54:15,619 --> 01:54:20,669
He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for

1616
01:54:20,669 --> 01:54:25,419
months on end.What could it be, once more?

1617
01:54:25,419 --> 01:54:30,082
I could think of nothing save that he wasrunning a tunnel to some other building.

1618
01:54:30,082 --> 01:54:34,699
"So far I had got when we went to visit thescene of action.

1619
01:54:34,699 --> 01:54:38,469
I surprised you by beating upon thepavement with my stick.

1620
01:54:38,469 --> 01:54:43,389
I was ascertaining whether the cellarstretched out in front or behind.

1621
01:54:43,389 --> 01:54:45,429
It was not in front.

1622
01:54:45,429 --> 01:54:50,036
Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, theassistant answered it.

1623
01:54:50,036 --> 01:54:55,034
We have had some skirmishes, but we hadnever set eyes upon each other before.

1624
01:54:55,034 --> 01:54:58,169
I hardly looked at his face.

1625
01:54:58,169 --> 01:55:03,003
His knees were what I wished to see.You must yourself have remarked how worn,

1626
01:55:03,003 --> 01:55:08,082
wrinkled, and stained they were.They spoke of those hours of burrowing.

1627
01:55:08,082 --> 01:55:13,011
The only remaining point was what they wereburrowing for.

1628
01:55:13,011 --> 01:55:17,077
I walked round the corner, saw the City andSuburban Bank abutted on our friend's

1629
01:55:17,077 --> 01:55:22,023
premises, and felt that I had solved myproblem.

1630
01:55:22,023 --> 01:55:26,055
When you drove home after the concert Icalled upon Scotland Yard and upon the

1631
01:55:26,055 --> 01:55:30,008
chairman of the bank directors, with theresult that you have seen."

1632
01:55:30,008 --> 01:55:35,699
"And how could you tell that they wouldmake their attempt to-night?"

1633
01:55:35,699 --> 01:55:36,919
I asked.

1634
01:55:36,919 --> 01:55:42,119
"Well, when they closed their Leagueoffices that was a sign that they cared no

1635
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:47,055
longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed

1636
01:55:47,055 --> 01:55:48,075
their tunnel.

1637
01:55:48,075 --> 01:55:53,084
But it was essential that they should useit soon, as it might be discovered, or the

1638
01:55:53,084 --> 01:55:56,008
bullion might be removed.

1639
01:55:56,008 --> 01:56:00,719
Saturday would suit them better than anyother day, as it would give them two days

1640
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:05,199
for their escape.For all these reasons I expected them to

1641
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:07,053
come to-night."

1642
01:56:07,053 --> 01:56:13,055
"You reasoned it out beautifully," Iexclaimed in unfeigned admiration.

1643
01:56:13,055 --> 01:56:17,029
"It is so long a chain, and yet every linkrings true."

1644
01:56:17,029 --> 01:56:24,036
"It saved me from ennui," he answered,yawning.

1645
01:56:24,036 --> 01:56:28,129
"Alas!I already feel it closing in upon me.

1646
01:56:28,129 --> 01:56:34,000
My life is spent in one long effort toescape from the commonplaces of existence.

1647
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:40,052
These little problems help me to do so.""And you are a benefactor of the race,"

1648
01:56:40,052 --> 01:56:42,029
said I.

1649
01:56:42,029 --> 01:56:47,001
He shrugged his shoulders."Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some

1650
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:53,007
little use," he remarked."'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,'

1651
01:56:53,007 --> 01:57:02,001
as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

1652
01:57:02,001 --> 99:59:59,999

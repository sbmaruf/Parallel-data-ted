00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:02,482
&lt;i&gt;Episode 9- Part 1 &lt;br&gt; [Episode 17]&lt;/i&gt;

2
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,319
Tae Ik,

3
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:32,391
What are you trying to do?

4
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:34,912
Until when will you keep being like this?

5
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:38,592
Until when are you going to treat me like a phantom.

6
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,061
You're drunk.

7
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,073
Go in and sleep.

8
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,232
I...

9
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:48,066
When I say that I want to start over with you,

10
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:50,079
I'm sincere.

11
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:57,577
Sincere?

12
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:00,598
You,

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,950
don't seem to remember.

14
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,186
You also said you were sincere when &lt;br&gt; you broke up with me.

15
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:07,473
Back then, Tae Ik...

16
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:11,104
I like you, I am sincere. &lt;br&gt;I want to break up with you, I am sincere.

17
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:17,217
Whether the other person gets hurt or not, all that matters is whether you like it. That kind of sincerity!

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,410
For someone like you,

19
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,779
do you actually have any sincerity?

20
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:26,016
What about you?

21
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:28,874
Being like this towards me now,

22
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:31,256
are you being sincere?

23
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,059
You still haven't gotten over me.

24
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:38,207
Pretending not to notice me, ignoring me.

25
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:41,394
It’s because you still haven’t gotten over me yet.

26
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,461
Then, what about that photo hidden behind the frame?

27
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:53,041
You said you're over me. Then, why &lt;br /&gt;do you have the photo you took with me?

28
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,435
When people were saying that you are gay,

29
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:59,263
if you had just shown that photo, you...

30
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:02,714
wouldn't have had problems.

31
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:09,206
You didn't show it&lt;br /&gt; because you wanted to protect me!

32
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:12,455
If you had shown that photo,

33
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:16,212
I may have gotten hurt.

34
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:50,795
Is it raining outside? I hung clothes…

35
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,726
Don’t misunderstand.

36
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:58,294
I just don’t want to be entangled with you ever again.

37
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:00,247
Instead of being entangled with you,

38
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,986
it is better to be misunderstood as being gay with Won Kang Hwi!

39
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:09,696
I know that it is all a lie between you and Jang Man Ok.

40
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:13,563
I'm Jin Sae Ryong! World star Jin Sae Ryong .

41
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:16,144
If I want something, I get it.

42
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:18,716
If I want to discard it, then I discard it!

43
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:21,527
Whatever that may be!

44
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,512
&lt;i&gt; You still haven’t gotten over me. &lt;/i&gt;

45
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:44,597
&lt;i&gt; You act like you can’t see me. You ignore me.&lt;br /&gt;You are purposely doing that &lt;/i&gt;

46
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:46,511
&lt;i&gt; because you still haven’t gotten over me yet. &lt;/i&gt;

47
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:50,316
&lt;i&gt; You said that you are over me!&lt;br /&gt;Then, why do you still have &lt;br /&gt;the photo you took with me? &lt;/i&gt;

48
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:53,897
&lt;i&gt; If you had shown that photo, you wouldn’t have had problems! &lt;/i&gt;

49
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:59,698
&lt;i&gt; You didn’t do so because you wanted to protect me. &lt;/i&gt;

50
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:11,362
Are you an idiot, Jang Man Ok? &lt;br&gt;Why did you run away from there?

51
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:14,961
I am freezing to death.

52
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,430
Are you a fool?

53
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,012
Are you exercising under the moonlight?

54
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,622
Why are you gardening in the middle of the night?

55
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,934
Let's go inside. It's cold.

56
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,562
What about Jin Se Ryeong?

57
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:49,038
What do I care?

58
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,015
Aren’t you going in?

59
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:58,307
I am going in.

60
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:28,702
I won't stay still.

61
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:34,963
I believe that you received several love calls from famous foreign directors.

62
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,229
Is there a special reason why you declined all those proposals and came to Korea?

63
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,365
A special reason?

64
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,747
I guess you could say it, personally, &lt;br /&gt;is a special reason for me.

65
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:54,670
Would it be okay to ask, in behalf of our viewers,&lt;br /&gt;what is that special reason?

66
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,707
There is something that I must get back.

67
00:05:56,703 --> 00:06:00,203
If it is something you need to get back…

68
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,540
For now, I can only tell you this much.

69
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:04,566
Ah, yes.

70
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,260
Then can you tell us briefly about your future plans?

71
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,986
I plan on choosing slowly.

72
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,354
I will meet you again with good work, whether it be a drama or a movie.

73
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:18,044
Okay! Miss Jin Se Ryeong, &lt;br&gt; you've worked hard.

74
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,999
You've worked hard!

75
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:23,506
Good job. &lt;br&gt;Director, good job!

76
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,489
Good job.

77
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:31,444
Good job. Reporter Nam is waiting.&lt;br /&gt;Let’s begin the interview immediately.

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,910
Buy me some stockings. I have a run in these.

79
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,763
I will buy you some after the interview is over while we are on the move.

80
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,009
I don’t want to do the interview in this state. &lt;br&gt;Buy some now.

81
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,656
Okay, fine.

82
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,220
I will ask for Reporter Nam’s understanding.

83
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,744
Wait here for a minute.

84
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:59,657
Se Ryeong, good job. &lt;br&gt;We will go ahead.

85
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,911
Go carefully.

86
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:06,252
It's all right. Go ahead.

87
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,117
Reporter Nam!

88
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:15,544
I am ready.

89
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:20,112
There is no reason to turn it on.

90
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:25,646
You needn’t turn on the laptop.

91
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:29,218
I didn’t call you to do an interview.

92
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:38,193
What is this?

93
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:40,895
You'll know when you look.

94
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:02,783
Oh?

95
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,237
Why did you call me?

96
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:08,673
What’s urgent?

97
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:11,124
First, have a seat.

98
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:19,862
The album turned out well. Good job.

99
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:22,755
Congratulations! Your song was nice.

100
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,323
Did you call me here to tell me that?

101
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:28,536
I called you so that the three of us&lt;br /&gt;can have lunch together. It’s been ages.

102
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:31,915
We haven’t had an official meal together after Se Ryeong returned.

103
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,785
I know a place that makes good Chinese food. &lt;br /&gt;I will make a reservation.

104
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:37,486
The two of you can eat.

105
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,412
I will be going.

106
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,699
Tae Ik!

107
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,033
This punk!

108
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:03,686
Where are you going? The car is over there.

109
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:09,758
What are you doing?

110
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,618
You! What are you doing?

111
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:15,361
Get out.

112
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,376
Let’s go and eat together.

113
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:22,188
I haven’t once had a meal facing you&lt;br /&gt;after I returned to Korea.

114
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,785
Do you have to go this far?

115
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:27,596
Why are you acting like this to me?

116
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:32,178
I am really sick and tired of you.

117
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:42,013
Don't try to stop me!

118
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:46,244
Lee Tae IK!

119
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,710
Lee Tae IK!!

120
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:58,105
Reporter Nam! It's me.

121
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,615
Reveal it as soon as possible.

122
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,133
Lee Tae Ik! Lee Tae Ik!

123
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,664
Lee Tae Ik! Let’s go together!

124
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:11,861
We are going home, aren’t we?

125
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,057
Ahjussi.

126
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,712
Ah! Not there.

127
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:16,862
Not Full House. Let's go somewhere else.

128
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,752
Anywhere!

129
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,100
Ahjussi, just go straight for now.

130
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:24,824
Is there anywhere you would like to go?

131
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,296
Is there something that you want to do?

132
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:30,573
Do you want to go to the amusement park?

133
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:32,627
Or do you want to see a movie?

134
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:34,322
Or...

135
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,981
So that we can get fresh air, &lt;br&gt;somewhere in the open?

136
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,840
Shall we really do it?

137
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,809
What?

138
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,840
What we faked and photographed?

139
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,614
Can you go all the way to the peak?

140
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,770
Are you belittling me now?

141
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,970
Hurry and follow me.

142
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,512
Oh! Let’s go together.

143
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:24,077
Hey! I’m tired, let’s go down now.

144
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:29,753
What is this? &lt;br&gt;There is just a little bit left.

145
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,741
No! No! No! &lt;br&gt;I can’t go anymore.

146
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:34,123
What man can’t even climb this?

147
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,540
No, we must go up to the peak. &lt;br&gt;Let’s finish climbing up.

148
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,723
No, it’s too much!

149
00:11:39,718 --> 00:11:41,498
We are almost there.

150
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:42,194
No! No!

151
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,040
Come on! Come on!

152
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,567
We reached it!

153
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:09,446
Come here.

154
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:12,677
1, 2, 3!

155
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:20,117
Now that we have come up, isn’t it really nice?

156
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:24,273
Yahoo!

157
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,248
Lee Tae Ik, give a shout out.

158
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:29,174
Forget it.

159
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:32,569
If you shout out, you will get it off your chest.

160
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,679
Rude bastard!

161
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:38,591
What?

162
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,309
Rude bastard!

163
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,653
Don’t do that!

164
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:46,075
Completely petty!

165
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:47,252
Hey!

166
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,769
Shout out louder!

167
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,276
Hey! Hey!

168
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,852
Hey! Hey! Hey!

169
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,856
Hey!

170
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:58,799
Now, since we don’t have time, shall we go back down?

171
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,990
We have to go to our next destination.

172
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:00,744
Already?

173
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,227
We don’t have much time.

174
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,059
Do you want that one?

175
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,034
No!

176
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:07,372
Give us two separate ones.

177
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:12,824
Why? Let’s ride that one. &lt;br&gt;It is more fun when the both of us ride together.

178
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,150
You’re heavy.

179
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,280
If you exceed the time limit, you have to pay more.

180
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,311
Thank you.

181
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,270
Jang Man! Let’s go together!

182
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:42,647
Isn’t that Lee Tae Ik?

183
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:43,372
Who is that woman?

184
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:43,969
His fiancée?

185
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:47,046
Take a photo! Take one! Jackpot!

186
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:54,167
Let’s go and buy some caps first.

187
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,748
Never mind. &lt;br&gt;Don’t worry about it.

188
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:56,997
Still…

189
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,238
Did you forget?

190
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,050
We are engaged.

191
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,029
We needn’t go around covering our faces as if we sinned.

192
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:09,364
Up to the convenience store over there.&lt;br /&gt;Last person to get there buys the ice cream.

193
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:10,434
Oh!

194
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,553
Then we need to start together!

195
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,832
That’s a foul, Lee Tae Ik!

196
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:19,502
Anything is good.

197
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:23,704
For instance, Lee Tae Ik’s fiancée was really bad at studies when she was at school.

198
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:26,611
The guy she dated when she was a student was a loser.

199
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:29,023
Anything that can become a potential article.

200
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,158
Well…

201
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,239
Anyway, I have no intention of selling out my friend’s personal information.

202
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:35,783
Look here, Reporter Han!

203
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,649
How can you write an article lacking the spirit of a journalist? Huh?

204
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,678
This is not selling personal information.

205
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,459
Huh?

206
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,398
We are providing the public with information that they want to know.

207
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,840
Whatever!

208
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,010
Whether it is the spirit of journalism or whatever.

209
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:52,674
After I provide such information,&lt;br /&gt;if I get caught by Man Ok later . . .

210
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:58,202
Oh my god!

211
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,589
Then, does that mean that it was all a scam so far?

212
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:04,701
How dare she with my oppa!

213
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,384
What is it?

214
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,871
&lt;i&gt;Lee Tae Ik’s Honorable and Pure Love &lt;br /&gt;Turns Out to Be a Contract Engagement. &lt;/i&gt;

215
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,286
What?

216
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:14,712
Contract engagement?

217
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,600
Evidence was found that popular singer,&lt;br /&gt;Lee Tae Ik’s engagement is fake.

218
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:21,397
The fans are in a state of shock.

219
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:23,088
Ah! What a loss!

220
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:25,174
This tremendous scoop! I should have fished it!

221
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,081
What’s up with Miss Jang? &lt;br&gt;She isn’t very pretty, she is even crazy.

222
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:34,415
Is it a rumor that Take One ended up like this&lt;br /&gt;because Miss Jang two-timed with Won Kang Hwi?

223
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,498
It’s not a rumor. In the article, it says &lt;br /&gt;that it was revealed by a closest person.

224
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:39,538
What is Miss Jang’s identity?

225
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:43,565
Ah! Jang Man Ok deceives me to the end? &lt;br /&gt;You betrayer!

226
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:46,371
Miss Jang’s personal information revealed!

227
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:48,213
Name, Jang Man Ok. &lt;br&gt;Age, 24 years old.

228
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,222
Class of 2006, Sang Sang Girls High School.

229
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:51,559
Master of the Hapkido Studio, Man Ok Kwan.

230
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:54,172
Once called the Goddess of War in Dohwadong.

231
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:03,177
Lee Tae Ik.

232
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,055
What?

233
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,230
Sitting here like this, it really feels&lt;br /&gt;like a secret date, doesn’t it?

234
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,059
Put out your hand behind your back.

235
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:37,681
If we do this, it feels more like a secret date, doesn’t it?

236
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,170
This isn’t a posture to be maintained for long!

237
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,009
Ah! Ye… yes.

238
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,617
It is uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Shall we sit facing each other?

239
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:07,283
Why? I also like this position.

240
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:16,852
We are drinking expensive coffee.&lt;br&gt;Isn’t it better to have it facing each other?

241
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,823
Are you hot, Jang Man?

242
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:25,643
Is your face burning up?

243
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:29,655
The co… coffee is hot, that’s why!

244
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,182
W... why?

245
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,638
What?

246
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,371
Perhaps... you think I will give you a foam kiss?

247
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,311
You watched too much TV.

248
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,304
Who… who?

249
00:18:01,274 --> 00:18:02,174
Where are you going?

250
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:03,653
Restroom.

251
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:06,507
Ah! Hurry back.

252
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,792
Yes.

253
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:19,356
&lt;i&gt; Jackpot! Lee Tae Ik and that fake fiancée&lt;br /&gt;are in Café W in Sinsa-dong. &lt;/i&gt;

254
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,111
Does a contract engagement make sense?

255
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:27,232
That Jang woman must have definitely seduced oppa!

256
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,233
That’s right! If she is caught by me...

257
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:33,721
Her personal information was revealed.&lt;br /&gt;Should we gather the girls and go catch her?

258
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,581
Yes, yes.

259
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,090
Hey! Miss Jang is in Café W in Sinsa-dong.

260
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:40,252
What? If it is W, it is just over there.

261
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:41,168
Where?

262
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,367
Isn’t that Lee Tae Ik’s fiancée?

263
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:45,606
Where? Where? Where?

264
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:47,906
She is dead!

265
00:18:57,923 --> 00:18:59,363
Oppa, please give me your autograph.

266
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,557
Yes.

267
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,185
You're dead!

268
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,916
- How dare you joke around with Tae Ik oppa? &lt;br&gt;- You are dead today!

269
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,459
Uh, why?

270
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:27,891
&lt;i&gt;Hyung-nim, where are you now?&lt;/i&gt;

271
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,094
Don’t worry, I will return shortly.

272
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:32,802
&lt;i&gt;That’s not it, hyung-nim.&lt;/i&gt;

273
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,350
&lt;i&gt;A big problem again!&lt;/i&gt;

274
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:35,409
Big problem?

275
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:36,419
&lt;i&gt;Didn’t you see the article?&lt;/i&gt;

276
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,674
&lt;i&gt;No, Stylist Jang! Is Stylist Jang with you?&lt;/i&gt;

277
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:42,005
Tell me properly!

278
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:42,665
What is the problem?

279
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:44,679
&lt;i&gt;That is…&lt;/i&gt;

280
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:49,995
&lt;i&gt;An article that says your engagement&lt;br&gt; to Stylist Jang is fake…&lt;/i&gt;

281
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,237
What the hell are you doing?!

282
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,674
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

283
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:05,217
I’m okay.

284
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,863
Are you an idiot?!&lt;br /&gt;Why are you standing there getting hit?!

285
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,457
You are a master of Hapkido.

286
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:12,206
Whether you throw them down or give them a kick! &lt;br /&gt;You must escape!

287
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,133
Why are you enduring it like an idiot?

288
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,958
Is this the face of someone who is okay?

289
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,832
Let’s go to the hospital first!

290
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,084
Hey! Are you okay?

291
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,721
Are you okay? What to do? Hey! Open your eyes!

292
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:26,883
Hey! Open your eyes!

293
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,116
What to do?

294
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,327
- Hey! Come to your senses! &lt;br&gt;- What to do?

295
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:33,531
- Hey! Hey! Hey! &lt;br&gt;- Come to your senses!

296
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:53,042
What happened, Go Dong?

297
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,370
Nothing is wrong, right?

298
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,229
Is she okay?

299
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:56,564
Yes.

300
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,001
They said she lost consciousness temporarily because she got worked up.

301
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,396
There is nothing wrong.

302
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:05,095
She just needs to rest a bit, so don’t worry too much.

303
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:08,593
It’s a relief!

304
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:12,461
Go ahead, hyung-nim.

305
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:13,947
They said she will wake up soon.

306
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:16,693
I will guard her till she wakes up and send her home.

307
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,087
Take care of her, Go Dong.

308
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,380
Yes, President.

309
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,550
Ah! She is okay.

310
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,024
Yes. Hyung-nim is going home now.

311
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,381
Go upstairs and get some rest.

312
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:51,114
I am going upstairs.

313
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:16,685
Where is Tae Ik?

314
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:20,834
Ah...He just now went up...

315
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:35,903
Are you in your right mind?!

316
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:40,798
The whole world is talking about the contract engagement! &lt;br&gt;As if that isn’t enough,&lt;br&gt; you go and hit a fan?!

317
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,350
What crazy action is this when the album release is just around the corner?!

318
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:48,535
I've kept saying that you are doing a good job. &lt;br&gt;How dare you stab me in the back?

319
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:50,428
Listen carefully!

320
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,850
All this is because of Stylist Jang.

321
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:56,047
She deliberately approached you.

322
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,392
And began all of this.

323
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,304
What are you talking about right now?

324
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,050
Doesn’t your head function at all?

325
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,581
The only way for you to live now is that way.

326
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,893
'A tragic star who was harassed by a stalker.'

327
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:14,912
'And eventually forced to get engaged.'

328
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:16,496
Are you crazy?

329
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:18,997
Who is the person who proposed the contract engagement to Stylist Jang?

330
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:23,149
The situation then and now are different. I...

331
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,260
Thinking about the money and time I spent taking care of your mess,

332
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:31,789
I will make Stylist Jang the scapegoat

333
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:34,034
and block this situation.

334
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,737
I...

335
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:41,998
What if I won’t dance to your tune anymore?

336
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,351
What are you going to do then?

337
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:48,132
You?

338
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:51,022
Because of a stylist?

339
00:23:56,265 --> 00:24:01,925
You don't think that you can stop me, do you?

340
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:05,049
Don’t think of anything stupid.

341
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:07,755
If you throw that woman to the people and stay quiet,

342
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:10,525
this will soon be resolved.

343
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,956
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.,

344
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:17,809
the press conference for the release of your album,

345
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,661
we will hold it as planned.

346
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:22,406
This problem...

347
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:28,815
Let’s cover it up well and... &lt;br&gt;let's start again.

348
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:40,229
&lt;i&gt; She deliberately approached you. &lt;/i&gt;

349
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,650
&lt;i&gt; And began all of this. &lt;/i&gt;

350
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:46,101
&lt;i&gt; What if I won’t dance to your tune anymore? &lt;/i&gt;

351
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,470
&lt;i&gt; What are you going to do then? &lt;/i&gt;

352
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,666
&lt;i&gt;Just because of a stylist? &lt;/i&gt;

353
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,574
&lt;i&gt; Don't think of anything stupid. &lt;/i&gt;

354
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,176
&lt;i&gt; If you throw that woman to the people and stay quiet, &lt;/i&gt;

355
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,183
&lt;i&gt; this will soon be resolved. &lt;/i&gt;

356
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,457
Yes, Grandpa.

357
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:14,473
&lt;i&gt;Jang Man Ok.&lt;/i&gt;

358
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,891
Grandpa,

359
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:18,257
why aren’t you sleeping at this hour, what’s up?

360
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:20,574
Why is your voice like that?

361
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:23,034
Are you not eating?

362
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:28,522
No. I ate it all.

363
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:32,708
There are no problems at the hapkido studio?

364
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,390
Yes, there are no problems, Grandpa.

365
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:42,327
Until grandfather return, &lt;br&gt;be on complete alert&lt;br&gt; and guard the studio well.

366
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:43,387
Yes.

367
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,960
&lt;i&gt;Where there is a way!&lt;/i&gt;

368
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,733
There is a will!

369
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:50,934
&lt;i&gt;Dismissed!&lt;/i&gt;

370
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,952
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:00,997
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

372
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:18,617
Man Ok!

373
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:23,018
Today is the day my cast is removed.

374
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,537
What is this?

375
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,069
Since you were stuck in the basement, &lt;br /&gt;you don’t know anything?

376
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,771
We just had a storm.

377
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:32,214
Why are you, alone, so bright?

378
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:33,338
Storm?

379
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,491
I guess you didn’t surf the internet at night?

380
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:39,387
Hey.

381
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:40,293
What is this?

382
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,730
Tell me properly!

383
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:45,838
They say that Jang Man Ok and Lee Tae Ik’s engagement is fake.

384
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:49,964
News broke out yesterday.

385
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:54,063
Because of that, Jang Man Ok’s hair got grabbed by the life-and-death fans.

386
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:57,592
Lee Tae Ik pushed that fan.&lt;br&gt; Now, there is an article about his violence.

387
00:26:57,588 --> 00:27:00,878
The President has lost his mind trying to take care of it.

388
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:03,593
It is a battlefield.

389
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:06,006
Where is Tae Ik?

390
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,011
I haven't seen him all morning.

391
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:11,429
Is he stuck in his room?

392
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:20,512
Only when a storm passes by,

393
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,070
can the sky clear.

394
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:35,007
What happened?

395
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:36,932
The fake engagement got revealed.

396
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:40,049
Man Ok suffered from the life-and-death fans.

397
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:41,934
What are you going to do now?

398
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,280
You involved an innocent person and&lt;br&gt; even made her get engaged to you.

399
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,019
Are you eventually planning to dump it all on Man Ok?

400
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:50,747
Perhaps?

401
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:52,664
Is that what you decided to do?

402
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:54,013
Are you crazy?!

403
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:58,158
Don’t bother about it. &lt;br&gt;I will take care of it.

404
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,336
What are you going to do?

405
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:00,516
How are you going to take care of it?!

406
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,269
Don't interfere!

407
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:03,908
This is my problem.

408
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:05,163
I will take care of it.

409
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,590
No, you can't.

410
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,536
You are merely LJ's puppet.

411
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:14,673
What can you do?

412
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,429
Eventually, it will be Man Ok who is hurt.

413
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,819
Like how I got hurt.

414
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,570
Listen carefully, Lee Tae Ik.

415
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,382
Whatever it is,

416
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:31,995
if something bad happens to Man Ok,

417
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:35,852
I will not let you off.

418
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,042
I'm happy. &lt;br&gt; I'm happy. [In Korean].

419
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,099
I'm happy.

420
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:04,459
I'm happy. &lt;br&gt; Completely happy.

421
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,050
I'm so happy. &lt;br&gt; I'm so happy. [In English]

422
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:12,552
I'm so...

423
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:15,232
What are you so happy about?

424
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,771
Why? Why did you stop singing? Continue!

425
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,940
I know how to sing that well in Chinese.

426
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,920
I'm happy. [In Chinese.]

427
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,887
I'm happy.

428
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:33,811
I'm happy.

429
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:36,668
I’m happy, I’m always happy.

430
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:39,573
Shall we go?

431
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,100
Pardon? Where?

432
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:45,504
I hate you! Did you already forget?

433
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,580
Today...

434
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:52,017
is the day I remove my cast.

435
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:53,685
Oh, that's right!

436
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:54,594
Let's quickly go.

437
00:29:54,591 --> 00:29:57,151
Let’s go remove the cast and eat something good.

438
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:57,845
Ah!

439
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,433
Let's go.

440
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:03,409
I will support you from this side.

441
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:04,018
Thanks.

442
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,690
- Lean on me. &lt;br&gt;- Yes.

443
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:12,429
I'm sorry for forgetting.

444
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:25,289
How is it?

445
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:27,296
Is it okay?

446
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,209
It is so refreshing.

447
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,047
I think I can live now.

448
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:34,662
The doctor said that you must still be careful.

449
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,336
Okay, I got it.

450
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,531
Hey, Man Ok

451
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:40,824
To celebrate my leg becoming well again,&lt;br&gt;let’s buy something good to eat.

452
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,220
I have some emergency funds. &lt;br&gt;What shall we eat?

453
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,984
Let’s just go home.

454
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:48,345
Why?

455
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:51,519
If someone recognizes you...

456
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,284
Instead, I will make you something delicious.

457
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,969
What do you want to have, Kang Hwi-nim?

458
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:05,256
It shouldn’t scar. This pretty face.

459
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:07,912
It won’t with something like this.

460
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:12,063
My skin is so good, it will be better in no time.

461
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,176
Just a moment.

462
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:18,147
Yes, Go Dong.

463
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:20,295
&lt;i&gt;Sylist Jang, where are you now?&lt;/i&gt;

464
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:22,074
&lt;i&gt;Is Tae Ik together with you?&lt;/i&gt;

465
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:23,652
No.

466
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,464
I am outside. Why?

467
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,279
&lt;i&gt;The press conference starts at 2 p.m.&lt;/i&gt;

468
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,585
&lt;i&gt;But there is no call from Tae Ik hyung-nim.&lt;/i&gt;

469
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:34,418
&lt;i&gt;The reporters are creating havoc.&lt;br&gt; And, he isn’t at home either.&lt;i/&gt;

470
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:35,753
What?

471
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:38,067
What do you mean by that?

472
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:54,442
&lt;i&gt; How is it? Our house. Do you like it? &lt;/i&gt;

473
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:56,947
&lt;i&gt; Is this really our house? &lt;/i&gt;

474
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,443
&lt;i&gt; I’m sorry. &lt;/i&gt;

475
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,340
&lt;i&gt; The whole responsibility is on me. &lt;/i&gt;

476
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:07,878
&lt;i&gt; So, I will leave U Entertainment on my own. &lt;/i&gt;

477
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,432
&lt;i&gt; What the hell are you doing now? &lt;/i&gt;

478
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,400
&lt;i&gt; I will no longer do it. &lt;/i&gt;

479
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,798
&lt;i&gt; Home. That's the only place Lee Tae Ik can go to. &lt;/i&gt;

480
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:14,542
&lt;i&gt; Lee Jun! &lt;/i&gt;

481
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,919
&lt;i&gt; I wonder who exposed the fact about the contract engagement to the reporters? &lt;/i&gt;

482
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,709
&lt;i&gt; Come back to me. &lt;/i&gt;

483
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:22,484
&lt;i&gt;I will reinstate you properly. &lt;/i&gt;

484
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,749
&lt;i&gt; What are you up to again? &lt;/i&gt;

485
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:26,814
&lt;i&gt; I must find Tae Ik. &lt;/i&gt;

486
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:31,062
&lt;i&gt; I think you would know where he went, Senior Manager. &lt;/i&gt;

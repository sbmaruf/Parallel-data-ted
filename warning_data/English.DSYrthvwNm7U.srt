1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,870
Which of the
following names can be

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,680
used to describe the
geometric shape below?

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,516
So the first name in
question is a quadrilateral.

5
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:11,570
And a quadrilateral is
literally any closed shape

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,550
that has four sides.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,870
And this is definitely a closed
shape that has four sides.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,670
So it is definitely
a quadrilateral.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,940
Next, we have to think about
whether it is a parallelogram.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,060
A parallelogram
is a quadrilateral

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,570
that has two pairs of parallel
sides, where in each pair

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,180
they're opposite sides.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,390
And in this case, if you
look at this side over here,

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,770
it forms a 90-degree
angle with this line.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,460
And this side over here
also forms a 90-degree angle

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,040
with this line over here.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,452
So these two sides are parallel.

18
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:47,410
And then you could make
the exact same argument

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,830
for the other two sides.

20
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,970
This line up here forms a
90-degree angle with this side.

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,260
And so does this side.

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,940
It forms a 90-degree angle
with this line right over here.

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,590
They form the same
angle with this line.

24
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,500
They're parallel.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,300
So this side is parallel to
that side right over there.

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,260
So this is definitely
also a parallelogram.

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,800
Next, we ask about a trapezoid.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,750
Now, trapezoid is interesting.

29
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,580
Sometimes a trapezoid is defined
as any quadrilateral having

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,720
at least one pair
of parallel sides.

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,520
Sometimes it's defined
as having only one

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,060
pair of parallel sides.

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,000
So let me write this down.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,710
Trapezoid, there's
a debate here.

35
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,970
It's not completely settled.

36
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:42,870
Some people say at least
one pair of parallel sides.

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,410
That's one definition,
one possible definition.

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:55,955
The other one is at exactly
one pair of parallel sides.

39
00:01:55,955 --> 00:02:01,270

40
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,740
How we answer this question
depends on which definition

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,410
for trapezoid we pick.

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,480
Now, the one that
people most refer to

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,620
is actually this
one right over here,

44
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,070
exactly one pair
of parallel sides.

45
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,040
So when you think
of a trapezoid,

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,030
they think of something like
this, where this side over here

47
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,110
is parallel to
that side over here

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,340
and those two are not parallel.

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,620
But sometimes you'll also
see this at least one

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,610
pair of parallel sides.

51
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,345
And so this would
include parallelograms.

52
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:32,970
It would be inclusive
of parallelograms

53
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,820
because parallelograms have
two pairs of parallel sides.

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,300
But I'm going to go with this
definition right over here,

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,720
exactly one pair
of parallel sides.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,270
This has two pairs
of parallel sides

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,080
so I will not call
it a trapezoid.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,260
But it's always important to
clarify what people are talking

59
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,080
about because some
people might say

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,610
a trapezoid is at least
one pair of parallel sides.

61
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,570
And if we used that
definition, then we

62
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,930
would call it a trapezoid.

63
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,900
So it really depends on the
definition that you're using.

64
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,910
Now, let's go on to rhombus.

65
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,020
So a rhombus is a quadrilateral
where four of the sides

66
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,123
are congruent.

67
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:14,100

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,000
So a rhombus will
look like this.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,700
All four sides have
the same length.

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,010
They're not necessarily at
right angles to each other.

71
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,180
This figure over here,
we have two pairs

72
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,880
of a size that are
the same length,

73
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,590
but there's no
information that tells us

74
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,370
that this side is
equal to that side

75
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,410
or that this side is
equal to that side.

76
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,840
So we can't make the claim that
this is necessarily a rhombus.

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,921
We don't know for sure.

78
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,420
If someone told us that this
length is equal to that length,

79
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,030
then things change.

80
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,780
But for the sake
of this one, we're

81
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,465
not going to go with a rhombus.

82
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:51,070
A rectangle is essentially
a parallelogram

83
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,780
that has four right angles.

84
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,320
And we already established
this is a parallelogram,

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,950
and it also has four right
angles-- one, two, three, four.

86
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,597
So this is a rectangle.

87
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:03,180
Another way to think
about a rectangle

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,140
is opposite sides
have the same length,

89
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,890
and you have four right angles.

90
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,870
So this is definitely
a rectangle.

91
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,070
A square, a couple of way
you can think about a square.

92
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,969
You could view a square as a
rhombus with four right angles

93
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:18,560
.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,540
So if were to straighten it out
a little bit, it's a rhombus

95
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,050
so all the four
sides are the same.

96
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,610
And you have four right angles.

97
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,320
That's one way to
think about a square.

98
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,940
Or you could view
it as a rectangle

99
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,140
where all four
sides are congruent.

100
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,360
But in either case, you have
to have all four sides be

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,260
congruent in order
to be a square.

102
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,720
And we already established we
ruled out this being a rhombus,

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,290
that all four sides here are
not necessarily congruent.

104
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,910
You have two pairs
of congruent sides,

105
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,240
but we don't know whether
this side and this side

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,400
are congruent.

107
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,600
So we cannot call this a square.

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,660
So it's not a square,
not a rhombus,

109
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,130
not a trapezoid by the
definition we picked,

110
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,790
which is the less
inclusive version where

111
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,980
you say exactly one
pair of parallel sides.

112
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,000
It is a quadrilateral.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,350
It is a parallelogram.

114
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,257
It is a rectangle.

115
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:06,757

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So congratulations, you just finished unit 1.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You just finished unit 1 of this class,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where I told you about key applications

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of artificial intelligence,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I told you about the definition of an intelligent agent,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I gave you 4 key attributes of intelligent agents

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
(partial observability, stochasticity, continuous spaces, and adversarial natures),

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I discussed sources and management of uncertainty,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and I briefly mentioned the mathematical concept of rationality.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Obviously, I only touched any of these issues superficially,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but as this class goes on you're going to dive into any of those

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and learn much more about

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
what it takes to make a truly intelligent AI system.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Thank you.

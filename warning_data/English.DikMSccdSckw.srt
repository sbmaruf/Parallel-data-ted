1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We are losing our listening.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but we're not very good at it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now not you, not this talk,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but that is generally true.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's define listening

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as making meaning from sound.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a mental process,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it's a process of extraction.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We use some pretty cool techniques to do this.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
One of them is pattern recognition.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
(Crowd Noise) So in a cocktail party like this,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention,"

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
some of you just sat up.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We recognize patterns

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to distinguish noise from signal,

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and especially our name.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Differencing is another technique we use.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes,

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
you would literally cease to hear it.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We listen to differences,

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we discount sounds that remain the same.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And then there is a whole range of filters.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
These filters take us from all sound

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
down to what we pay attention to.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Most people are entirely unconscious

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of these filters.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But they actually create our reality in a way,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Give you one example of that:

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Intention is very important in sound, in listening.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When I married my wife,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I promised her that I would listen to her every day

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
as if for the first time.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
(Laughter)

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But it's a great intention to have in a relationship.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But that's not all.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sound places us in space and in time.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you close your eyes right now in this room,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you're aware of the size of the room

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
from the reverberation

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And you're aware of how many people are around you

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because of the micro-noises you're receiving.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And sound places us in time as well,

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because sound always has

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
time embedded in it.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that we experience the flow of time

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
from past to future.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, "Sonority is time and meaning" -- a great quote.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why did I say that?

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well there are a lot of reasons for this.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
First of all, we invented ways of recording --

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
first writing, then audio recording

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and now video recording as well.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The premium on accurate and careful listening

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
has simply disappeared.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Secondly, the world is now so noisy,

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
(Noise) with this cacophony going on

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
visually and auditorily,

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
it's just hard to listen;

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it's tiring to listen.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Many people take refuge in headphones,

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but they turn big, public spaces like this,

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
shared soundscapes,

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
into millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We're becoming impatient.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We don't want oratory anymore,

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
we want sound bites.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And the art of conversation

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is being replaced -- dangerously, I think --

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
by personal broadcasting.

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation,

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
which is sadly very common,

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
especially in the U.K.

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're becoming desensitized.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
in order to get our attention.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And that means it's harder for us to pay attention

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to the quiet, the subtle,

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the understated.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is not trivial.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because listening is our access to understanding.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Conscious listening always creates understanding.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And only without conscious listening

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
can these things happen --

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
a world where we don't listen to each other at all,

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
is a very scary place indeed.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I'd like to share with you

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
five simple exercises, tools you can take away with you,

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to improve your own conscious listening.

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Would you like that?

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
(Audience: Yes.) Good.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The first one is silence.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Just three minutes a day of silence

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
is a wonderful exercise

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
to reset your ears and to recalibrate

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
so that you can hear the quiet again.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you can't get absolute silence,

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
go for quiet, that's absolutely fine.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Second, I call this the mixer.

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this --

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and we all spend a lot of time in places like this --

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
listen in the coffee bar

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
to how many channels of sound can I hear?

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to?

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How many birds am I hearing?

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where are they? Where are those ripples?

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a great exercise

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
for improving the quality of your listening.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Third, this exercise I call savoring,

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and this is a beautiful exercise.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(Dryer) It's a waltz.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I love it.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Or just try this one on for size.

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
(Coffee grinder)

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wow!

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I call that the hidden choir.

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's around us all the time.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The next exercise

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
is probably the most important of all of these,

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
if you just take one thing away.

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is listening positions --

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the idea that you can move your listening position

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to what's appropriate to what you're listening to.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is playing with those filters.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you remember, I gave you those filters at the beginning.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's starting to play with them as levers,

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to get conscious about them and to move to different places.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
These are just some of the listening positions,

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
or scales of listening positions, that you can use.

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There are many.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Have fun with that. It's very exciting.

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And finally, an acronym.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can use this in listening, in communication.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you're in any one of those roles --

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk --

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the acronym is RASA,

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
which is the Sanskrit word

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
for juice or essence.

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And RASA stands for Receive,

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
which means pay attention to the person;

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Appreciate, making little noises

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
like "hmm," "oh," "okay";

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Summarize, the word "so" is very important in communication;

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and Ask, ask questions afterward.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen.

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's too much to ask from most people.

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But I believe that every human being

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
needs to listen consciously

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
in order to live fully --

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
connected in space and in time

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to the physical world around us,

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
connected in understanding to each other,

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
not to mention spiritually connected,

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because every spiritual path I know of

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
has listening and contemplation

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
at its heart.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's why

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
we need to teach listening in our schools

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
as a skill.

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And if we can teach listening in our schools,

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
we can take our listening off that slippery slope

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time --

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
or at least capable of doing it.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now I don't know how to do that,

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
but this is TED,

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and I think the TED community is capable of anything.

183
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other,

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools,

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world --

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
a world of connection,

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
a world of understanding and a world of peace.

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you for listening to me today.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
(Applause)

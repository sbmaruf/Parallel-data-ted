1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,010
A club of nine people wants
to choose a board of three

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,600
officers, President, Vice
President, and Secretary.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,520
Assuming the officers are chosen
at random, what is the

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,390
probability that the officers
are Marcia for president,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,300
Sabita for Vice President,
and Robert for Secretary?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,510
So to think about the
probability of Marcia-- so let

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:29,795
me write this-- President is
equal to Marcia, or Vice

9
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:34,500
President is equal
to Sabita, and

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,375
Secretary is equal to Robert.

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,980

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,630
This, right here, is one
possible outcome,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,705
one specific outcome.

14
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:49,240
So it's one outcome out of the
total number of outcomes, over

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,915
the total number of
possibilities.

16
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:55,940

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,000
Now what is the total number
of possibilities?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,670
Well to think about that, let's
just think about the

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,980
three positions.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,920
You have President, you
have Vice President,

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,670
and you have Secretary.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,860
Now let's just assume that we're
going to fill the slot

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,060
of President first. We don't
have to do President first,

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,370
but we're just going
to pick here.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,940
So if we're just picking
President first, we haven't

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,880
assigned anyone to any officers
just yet, so we have

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,630
nine people to choose from.

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,950
So there are nine possibilities
here.

29
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,530
Now, when we go to selecting our
Vice President, we would

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,330
have already assigned one
person to the President.

31
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,740
So we only have eight
people to pick from.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,100
And when we assign our
Secretary, we would've already

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,570
assigned our President and Vice
President, so we're only

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,830
going to have seven people
to pick from.

35
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,190
So the total permutations here
or the total number of

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,850
possibilities, or the total
number of ways, to pick

37
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,820
President, Vice President, and
Secretary from nine people, is

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,990
going to be 9 times 8 times 7.

39
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,310
Which is, let's see,
9 times 8 is 72.

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:01,890
72 times 7, 2 times 7 is 14, 7
times 7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.

41
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,620
So there's 504 possibilities.

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,789
So to answer the question, the
probability of Marcia being

43
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,080
President, Sabita being Vice
President, and Robert being

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Secretary is 1 over the total
number of possibilities, which

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,960
is 1 over 504.

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,780
That's the probability.

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,066

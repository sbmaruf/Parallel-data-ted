1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Imagine a big explosion

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
as you climb through 3,000 ft.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
clack, clack, clack, clack.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It sounds scary.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I looked at them right away,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds."

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The pilot had already turned the plane around,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we weren't that far.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You could see Manhattan.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Two minutes later,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
three things happened at the same time.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's usually not the route.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
(Laughter)

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He turns off the engines.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now imagine being in a plane with no sound.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then he says three words --

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the most unemotional three words I've ever heard.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He says, "Brace for impact."

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
(Laughter)

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I could see in her eyes,

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
it was terror. Life was over.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I learned that it all changes in an instant.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We have this bucket list,

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
we have these things we want to do in life,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
all the fences I wanted to mend,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As I thought about that later on,

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I came up with a saying,

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which is, "I collect bad wines."

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I no longer want to postpone anything in life.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And that urgency, that purpose,

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
has really changed my life.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The second thing I learned that day --

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge,

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
which was by not a lot --

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought about, wow,

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I really feel one real regret.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've lived a good life.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In my own humanity and mistakes,

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've tried to get better at everything I tried.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But in my humanity,

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I also allow my ego to get in.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I regretted the time I wasted

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
on things that did not matter

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
with people that matter.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I thought about my relationship with my wife,

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
with my friends, with people.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And after, as I reflected on that,

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It feels great.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I no longer try to be right;

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I choose to be happy.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The third thing I learned --

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and this is as your mental clock

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
starts going, "15, 14, 13."

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can see the water coming.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm saying, "Please blow up."

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
like you've seen in those documentaries.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And as we're coming down,

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I had a sense of, wow,

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
dying is not scary.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But it was very sad.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't want to go; I love my life.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And that sadness

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
really framed in one thought,

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
which is, I only wish for one thing.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter --

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
first-grader, not much artistic talent ...

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
... yet.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
(Laughter)

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I'm balling, I'm crying,

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
like a little kid.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And it made all the sense in the world to me.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I realized at that point,

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
by connecting those two dots,

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that the only thing that matters in my life

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is being a great dad.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Above all, above all,

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the only goal I have in life

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
is to be a good dad.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I was given the gift of a miracle,

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
of not dying that day.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was given another gift,

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
which was to be able to see into the future

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and come back

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and live differently.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I challenge you guys that are flying today,

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
imagine the same thing happens on your plane --

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and please don't --

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but imagine, and how would you change?

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What would you get done that you're waiting to get done

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
because you think you'll be here forever?

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How would you change your relationships

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and the negative energy in them?

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
(Applause)

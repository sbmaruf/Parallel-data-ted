1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:03,800
A line goes through the points (-1, 6)

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,333
and (5, 4). What is the equation of the line?

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:12,133
Let's just try to visualize this. So that is my

4
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,800
x axis. And you don't have to draw it

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,200
to do this problem but it always help to visualize

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,733
That is my y axis. And the first point is (-1,6)

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:29,400
So (-1, 6). So negative 1 coma, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 6.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,400
So it's this point, rigth over there, it's (-1, 6).

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,400
And the other point is (5, -4). So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,133
And we go down 4, So 1, 2, 3, 4

11
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:46,400
So it's rigth over there. So the line connects them

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,000
will looks something like this. Line will

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,333
draw a rough approximation.

14
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,467
I can draw a straighter  than that. I will draw a doted line maybe

15
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,533
Easier do doted line.

16
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,733
So the line will looks something like that.

17
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:02,600
So let's find its equation. So good place to start

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,000
is we can find its slope.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Remember, we want, we can find the equation

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,801
y is equal to mx plus b.

21
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:12,733
This is the slope-intercept form where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

22
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:16,467
We can first try to solve for m. We can find the slope of this line.

23
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:21,133
So m, or the slope is the change in y over the change in x.

24
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:26,216
Or, we can view it as the y value of our end point

25
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:29,467
minus the y value of our starting point over

26
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:33,467
the x-value of our end point minus the x-value of our starting point.

27
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:36,000
Let me make that clear. So this is equal to

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,267
change in y over change in x wich is the same thing as

29
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,867
rise over run wich is the same thing as the y-value of

30
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:49,267
your ending point minus the y-value of your starting point.

31
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:53,400
This is the same exact thing as change in y and that over

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,200
the x value of your ending point minus the x-value of your starting point

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,933
This is the exact same thing as change in x.

34
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,533
And you just have to pick one of these as the starting point

35
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:05,411
and one as the ending point. So let's just make this over here

36
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:07,467
our starting point and make that our ending point.

37
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,400
So what is our change in y?

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,049
So our change in y, to go we started at y

39
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,000
is equal to six, we started at y is equal to 6.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,133
And we go down all the way to y is equal to negative 4

41
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:24,733
So this is rigth here, that is our change in y

42
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,634
You can look at the graph and say, oh,

43
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:29,978
if I start at 6 and I go to negative 4 I went down 10.

44
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:33,267
or if you just want to use this formula here it will give you the same thing

45
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:37,315
We finished at negative 4, we finished at negative 4

46
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:40,380
and from that we want to subtract, we want to subtract 6.

47
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,000
This right here is y2, our ending y and this is our beginning y

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,067
This is y1. So y2, negative 4 minus y1, 6.

49
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,933
or negative 4 minus 6.

50
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,800
That is equal to negative 10.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,303
And all it does is tell us the change in y

52
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:01,667
you go from this point to that point

53
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:05,000
We have to go down, our rise is negative

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,012
we have to go down 10. That's where the negative 10 comes from.

55
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,867
Now we just have to find our change in x.

56
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,133
So we can look at this graph over here.

57
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:16,400
We started at x is equal to negative 1 and we go all the way

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
to x is equal to 5. So we started at x is equal to negative 1,

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,533
and we go all the way to x is equal to 5.

60
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:26,200
So it takes us one to go to zero and then five more.

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,049
So are change in x is 6.

62
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,200
You can look at that visually there or

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,400
you can use this formula same exact idea,

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,667
our ending x-value, our ending x-value is 5

65
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:41,634
and our starting x-value is negative 1.

66
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:46,533
5 minus negative 1. 5 minus negative 1 is the same thing as

67
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:52,037
5 plus 1. So it is 6. So our slope here is negative 10 over 6.

68
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,400
wich is the exact same thing as negative 5 thirds.

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,067
as negative 5 over 3 I devided the numerator and the denominator by 2.

70
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,733
So we now know our equation will be

71
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,067
y is equal to negative 5 thirds, that's our slope,

72
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:16,333
x plus b. So we still need to solve for y-intercept to get our equation.

73
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:20,333
And to do that, we can use the information that we know

74
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,384
in fact we have several points of information

75
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:27,133
We can use the fact that the line goes through the point (-1,6)

76
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,067
you could use the other point as well.

77
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,200
We know that when is equal to negative 1,

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,933
So y is eqaul to 6. So y is equal to six when x is equal to negative 1

79
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:41,800
So negative 5 thirds times x, when x is equal to negative 1

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,200
y is equal to 6. So we literally just substitute this x and y value

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,867
back into this and know we can solve for be.

82
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,733
So let's see, this negative 1 times negative 5 thirds.

83
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:58,133
So we have 6 is equal to positive five thirds plus b.

84
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,667
And now we can subtract 5 thirds from both sides of this equation.

85
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,733
so we have subtracted the left hand side.

86
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,400
From the left handside and subtracted from the rigth handside

87
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,800
And then we get, what's 6 minus 5 thirds.

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,561
So that's going to be, let me do it over here

89
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,867
We take a common denominator. So 6 is the same thing as

90
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:23,291
Let's do it over here. So 6 minus 5 over 3 is the same thing as

91
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,867
6 is the same thing as 18 over 3 minus 5 over 3

92
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:36,933
6 is 18 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3.

93
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,533
And then of course, these cancel out. So we get

94
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:43,400
b is equal to 13 thirds. So we are done. We know

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,867
We know the slope and we know the y-intercept.

96
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,000
The equation of our line is y is equal to

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,200
negative 5 thirds x plus our y-intercept which is 13

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,329
which is 13 over 3. And we can write these as mixte numbers.

99
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:02,733
if it's easier to visualize. 13 over 3 is four and 1 thirds.

100
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,267
So this y-intercept right over here.

101
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:09,800
this y-intercept right over here. That's 0 coma 13 over 3 or

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,200
0 coma 4 and 1 thirds. And even with my very roughly drawn diagram

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,467
it those looks like this. And the slope negative 5 thirds

104
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,177
that's the same thing as negative 1 and 2 thirds.

105
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:25,067
You can see here the slope is downward because the slope is negative.

106
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,667
It's a little bit steeper than a slope of 1.

107
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:32,333
It's not quite a negative 2. It's negative 1 and 2 thirds.

108
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,133
if you write ithis as a mixt number.

109
00:06:35,482 --> 99:59:59,000
So, hopefully, you found that entertaining.

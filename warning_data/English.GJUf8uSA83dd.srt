1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630


2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,400
Calculate the area of a
rectangular room that is 13

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
feet wide and 18 feet long.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,860
So the room might
look like this.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,470
We're looking at a floor plan.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:20,080
So it is 13 feet wide and
it is 18 feet long.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,130
So that dimension is 18 feet.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,920
And when you're looking for the
area of a rectangle, you

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,440
literally just multiply
the two dimensions.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,850
You multiply the width times
the length in this case.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,770
So the area is going
to be equal to 13

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,265
times 18 square feet.

13
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:40,750
So let's multiply that out.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,690
13 times 18.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,320
Now we're first going to worry
about this 8 in the ones

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,980
place, right?

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,000
18 is really 10 plus 8.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,820
So when we take this 8 in the
ones place, 8 times 3 is 24,

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,400
the 4 in the ones places.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,230
Regroup the 2, which is really
a 20, or carry the 2.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,390
8 times 1, now this 1 is really
a 10, so 8 times 1 is

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,510
8, plus 2 is 10, and there's
no other digits, so we can

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,690
write the whole 10 down here.

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,170
So we now see that 8
times 13 is 104.

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,340
Now let's worry about
the next digit.

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,950
Let us worry about this 1 right
here in the tens place.

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,170
Now since it's in the tens
place, we want to

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,250
put a zero down here.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,230
1 times 3 is 3.

30
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,370
1 times 1, we ignore this 2.

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,200
That was from the other
digit so we ignore it.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,120
1 times 1 is 1.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,400
So you see that 8 times 13 is
104, 1 times 13, or we should

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,510
say 10 times 13, because
that 1 is in the

35
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,740
tens place, is 130.

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,200
18 is the sum of 10 and 8, so 18
times 13 is going to be the

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,310
sum of these two numbers.

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,260
So it's going to be
104 plus 130.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,310
4 plus 0 is 4, 0 plus 3
is 3, 1 plus 1 is 2.

40
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,152
So the area of the room is 234
square feet, or you could call

41
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,530
it feet squared, however
you want to do it.

42
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,860
I'll write it like this:
square feet.

43
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,260
And if you're actually draw a
grid where you drew 18 lines

44
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,980
in this direction, if you kept
going, and 13 lines in this

45
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,740
direction, if you were to
count all the boxes,

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,820
you would get 234.

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,134

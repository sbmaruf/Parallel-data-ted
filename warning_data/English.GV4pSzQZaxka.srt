1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,070
Is the relation given by the
set of ordered pairs shown

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,930
below a function?

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,400
So before we even attempt
to do this problem,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,210
right here, let's just remind
ourselves what a relation is

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,770
and what type of relations
can be functions.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,770
So in a relation, you
have a set of numbers

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,720
that you can kind of view as
the input into the relation.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,350
We call that the domain.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,240
You can view them as
the set of numbers

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,490
over which that
relation is defined.

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,920
And then you have
a set of numbers

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,620
that you can view as the
output of the relation,

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,330
or what the numbers that can
be associated with anything

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,230
in domain, and we
call that the range.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,130
And it's a fairly
straightforward idea.

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,360
So for example, let's say that
the number 1 is in the domain,

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,240
and that we associate the
number 1 with the number 2

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,850
in the range.

19
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,427
So in this type of
notation, you would

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,340
say that the relation
has 1 comma 2

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,240
in its set of ordered pairs.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,400
These are two ways of
saying the same thing.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,730
Now the relation can also
say, hey, maybe if I have 2,

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,850
maybe that is associated
with 2 as well.

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,620
So 2 is also associated
with the number 2.

26
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,986
And so notice, I'm just building
a bunch of associations.

27
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,770
I've visually drawn
them over here.

28
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,560
Here I'm just doing
them as ordered pairs.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,540
We could say that we
have the number 3.

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,720
3 is in our domain.

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,330
Our relation is
defined for number 3,

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,510
and 3 is associated with,
let's say, negative 7.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,020
So this is 3 and negative 7.

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,720
Now this type of
relation right over here,

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,330
where if you give me any
member of the domain,

36
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,650
and I'm able to tell you exactly
which member of the range

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,200
is associated with it, this is
also referred to as a function.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,640
And in a few seconds,
I'll show you

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,740
a relation that
is not a function.

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,490
Because over here, you pick
any member of the domain,

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,820
and the function really
is just a relation.

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,090
It's really just an
association, sometimes called

43
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,730
a mapping between
members of the domain

44
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,360
and particular
members of the range.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,030
So you give me any
member of the domain,

46
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,146
I'll tell you exactly which
member of the range it maps to.

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,590
You give me 1, I say, hey,
it definitely maps it to 2.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,980
You give me 2, it definitely
maps to 2 as well.

49
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,460
You give me 3, it's definitely
associated with negative 7

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,200
as well.

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,330
So this relation is both a--
it's obviously a relation--

52
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,010
but it is also a function.

53
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,087
Now to show you a relation
that is not a function,

54
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,700
imagine something like this.

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,760
So once again, I'll
draw a domain over here,

56
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,790
and I do this big, fuzzy
cloud-looking thing

57
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,710
to show you that I'm not
showing you all of the things

58
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,290
in the domain.

59
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,193
I'm just picking
specific examples.

60
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,840
And let's say that this big,
fuzzy cloud-looking thing

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
is the range.

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,060
And let's say in this
relation-- and I'll

63
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,940
build it the same way that
we built it over here-- let's

64
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,440
say in this relation,
1 is associated with 2.

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,490
So let's build the
set of ordered pairs.

66
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,890
So 1 is associated with 2.

67
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,420
Let's say that 2
is associated with,

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,250
let's say that 2 is
associated with negative 3.

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,270
So you'd have 2,
negative 3 over there.

70
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,970
And let's say on top of
that, we also associate,

71
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,390
we also associate 1
with the number 4.

72
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,490
So we also created
an association with 1

73
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,960
with the number 4.

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,860
So we have the ordered
pair 1 comma 4.

75
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,400
Now this is a relationship.

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,580
We have, it's defined
for a certain--

77
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:26,946
if this was a
whole relationship,

78
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,940
then the entire domain is
just the numbers 1, 2--

79
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,100
actually just the
numbers 1 and 2.

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,800
It's definitely a relation, but
this is no longer a function.

81
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,627
And the reason why it's
no longer a function

82
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,160
is, if you tell me,
OK I'm giving you 1

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,030
in the domain, what member of
the range is 1 associated with?

84
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:45,607
Over here, you say, well I don't
know, is 1 associated with 2,

85
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,870
or is it associated with 4?

86
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,570
It could be either one.

87
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,430
So you don't have a
clear association.

88
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,430
If I give you 1 here,
you're like, I don't know,

89
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,470
do I hand you a 2 or 4?

90
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,910
That's not what a function does.

91
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,584
A function says, oh,
if you give me a 1,

92
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,180
I know I'm giving you a 2.

93
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,930
If you give me 2, I
know I'm giving you 2.

94
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,760
Now with that out of
the way, let's actually

95
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,943
try to tackle the
problem right over here.

96
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,941
So let's think about its
domain, and let's think

97
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,240
about its range.

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,920
So the domain here,
the possible, you

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,190
can view them as x
values or inputs,

100
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,960
into this thing that could be
a function, that's definitely

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,280
a relation, you could
have a negative 3.

102
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,249
You could have a negative 2.

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,210
You could have a 0.

104
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,650
You could have a, well, we
already listed a negative 2,

105
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,000
so that's right over there.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,510
Or you could have a positive 3.

107
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,910
Those are the possible values
that this relation is defined

108
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,960
for, that you could
input into this relation

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,920
and figure out what it outputs.

110
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,150
Now the range here, these
are the possible outputs

111
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,650
or the numbers
that are associated

112
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,260
with the numbers in the domain.

113
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:56,230
The range includes 2, 4,
5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 8.

114
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,300
2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

115
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,280
I could have drawn this
with a big cloud like this,

116
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,357
and I could have done this
with a cloud like this,

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,060
but here we're showing
the exact numbers

118
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,490
in the domain and the range.

119
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,880
And now let's draw the
actual associations.

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,120
So negative 3 is associated
with 2, or it's mapped to 2.

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,630
So negative 3 maps
to 2 based on this

122
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,360
ordered pair right over there.

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,030
Then we have negative
2 is associated with 4.

124
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,990
So negative 2 is
associated with 4

125
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,020
based on this ordered
pair right over there.

126
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,395
Actually that
first ordered pair,

127
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,670
let me-- that
first ordered pair,

128
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,450
I don't want to
get you confused.

129
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,770
It should just be this
ordered pair right over here.

130
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,260
Negative 3 is associated with 2.

131
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,870
Then we have negative 2-- we'll
do that in a different color--

132
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,990
we have negative 2
is associated with 4.

133
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,090
Negative 2 is associated with 4.

134
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,060
We have 0 is associated with 5.

135
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,260
0 is associated with 5.

136
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,600
Or sometimes people
say, it's mapped to 5.

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,050
We have negative
2 is mapped to 6.

138
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,050
Now this is interesting.

139
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,830
Negative 2 is already
mapped to something.

140
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,070
Now this ordered pair is
saying it's also mapped to 6.

141
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,520
And then finally--
I'll do this in a color

142
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,771
that I haven't used yet,
although I've used almost all

143
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,830
of them-- we have
3 is mapped to 8.

144
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,000
3 is mapped to 8.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,170
So the question here,
is this a function?

146
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,850
And for it to be a function
for any member of the domain,

147
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,180
you have to know what
it's going to map to.

148
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,210
It can only map to one
member of the range.

149
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,580
So negative 3, if you put
negative 3 as the input

150
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,160
into the function, you know
it's going to output 2.

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
If you put negative 2 into
the input of the function,

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,340
all of a sudden
you get confused.

153
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,680
Do I output 4, or do I output 6?

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,740
So you don't know if you
output 4 or you output 6.

155
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,780
And because there's
this confusion,

156
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,380
this is not a function.

157
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,430
You have a member
of the domain that

158
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,180
maps to multiple
members of the range.

159
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,700
So this right over here is not
a function, not a function.

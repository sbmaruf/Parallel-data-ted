1
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:51,462
This one..

2
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:54,062
Ohh. Isn't it pretty?

3
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:56,753
It's unique and doesn't look that difficult to make,

4
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:58,019
so I want to give it a try.

5
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:01,654
Where did you get it from?

6
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:04,092
Why?

7
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:08,796
Tell me! Where did you get this?!

8
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:28,175
From the teacher who teaches here...

9
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,111
To me that friend was

10
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,845
my kiln

11
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:37,504
and potter's wheel.

12
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:41,357
I was afraid

13
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:46,298
that I would make her cry.

14
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:50,043
Like my father...

15
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:54,771
and my mother...

16
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:59,578
I didn't want her to end up crying because of me

17
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,094
I ran away.

18
00:02:03,094 --> 00:03:46,209
Impossible.

19
00:03:46,209 --> 00:06:12,939
Get lost!

20
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,324
I told you not to get involved with a man like him.

21
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:19,365
Do you know how insulting that was for him?

22
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:23,276
I gave them money for their troubles. What is the problem?

23
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:24,903
Was it not enough?

24
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:26,497
This is

25
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:30,128
the first time I've ever wanted something.

26
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,061
Can't you let me win just this once?

27
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,942
How?

28
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:37,938
How can that kind of a man be what you want?

29
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,002
You are Shinhwa group's heiress!

30
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:45,148
Instead of meeting Korea's, no, Asia's best male prospects...

31
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:46,898
Get a hold of yourself!

32
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,727
To me

33
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:51,566
that person is the 'best'

34
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,742
because I love him.

35
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:56,485
Other men, no matter who they are, makes no difference to me!

36
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59,516
Pathetic girl.

37
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:04,004
Marrying a man for a love that will fade in a few years

38
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,262
that will not be an option.

39
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,229
Mum...

40
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,696
That's right!

41
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:08,632
Because I am your mother,

42
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,008
because you were born into the Shinhwa group,

43
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:16,208
I cannot allow your foolish gamble at love.

44
00:07:16,208 --> 00:08:17,125
You can do that in your next life.

45
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:17,961
Hey!

46
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:20,469
Miss?

47
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:30,735
What should we do?! Are you all right, Miss?

48
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,067
Hello?

49
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:35,515
The lady has fainted here!

50
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:45,225
If you're wondering where this is...

51
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:49,073
Are you awake?

52
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:50,327
What happened?

53
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,443
You were almost in big trouble!

54
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,376
You collapsed on the road.

55
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,988
But how did you...?

56
00:08:56,988 --> 00:09:00,018
What would have happened if I had not called you at the right time?

57
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,533
Why were you being so foolish?

58
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:05,187
Didn't I tell you to call me if things got too hard for you?

59
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:09,911
Don't you consider us sisters anymore?

60
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:11,373
It's not that.

61
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:15,457
Did something bad happen?

62
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:31,627
Then, from now on, you have to listen to what I say.

63
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,552
From now on, Jandi, you are my guest.

64
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:38,653
Since your parents aren't around, you cannot leave this house until things get better for you.

65
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:39,516
Understand?

66
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:41,788
Unni(Older Sister), but that is.. a little..

67
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,782
Regardless of Joon Pyo

68
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,987
Didn't we decide that you were going to treat me as if I were your real older sister?

69
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,442
Even so...the President..

70
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,244
There's no need to worry about my mother.

71
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,655
She's out of the country for awhile.

72
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:57,514
You don't have any more concerns do you?

73
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:02,033
So lot of nerve, though, and you...

74
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:05,847
Right! That's the way it ought to be!

75
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:09,004
But...I have a condition too...

76
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,062
Condition?

77
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:14,729
I don't like to accept things for free.

78
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:18,386
For sleeping and eating in this house

79
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,214
Please put me to work.

80
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:33,959
What?

81
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,034
I am curious about something.

82
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:40,202
About what?

83
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:43,389
What is your reason for being so nice to me?

84
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,956
You know, honestly

85
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:48,077
Goo Joon Pyo is already engaged.

86
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:53,498
If the President find out that you're doing this...

87
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:56,032
Are you really that curious?

88
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:56,999
Finished!

89
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:23,591
It's a gift!

90
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:26,752
From today onwards, Miss Geum Jandi, is the new maid.

91
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,644
She is like my sister, i want to give her all but she want to work.

92
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:35,079
Everyone, please help her out.

93
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,041
Hello, I'm Geum Jan Di...

94
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,044
Please take care of me.

95
00:11:40,044 --> 00:12:00,868
There is no need for us to take care of you!

96
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:01,939
Grandma.

97
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,999
Please take care of her.

98
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,425
If you have to ask that

99
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,088
its better if she doesn't start.

100
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:12,571
Granny, go a little gentler on her.

101
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:13,668
No. There's no need!

102
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,732
I will do my best!

103
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,978
Please treat me the same as you would the others.

104
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:20,669
Your best will not do.

105
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:21,322
Perfect.

106
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,065
In this household perfection is a requirement

107
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:31,301
Are you ready?

108
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,061
You are not a child. Answer the question!

109
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,964
Say, "Yes! I understand!"

110
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:41,776
Confidently and clearly.

111
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:47,209
Yes..I understand!

112
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,665
I have to return to the US.

113
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,355
Will you be fine on your own?

114
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,759
Don't worry about me.

115
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,031
You! You new girl!

116
00:12:57,031 --> 00:13:00,088
What do you think you're doing, chatting instead of getting to work?

117
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,036
Yes, granny!

118
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,398
What do you mean, "Granny"?

119
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:08,161
How did I become "Grandma" to Miss Geum Jandi?

120
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,354
Then...what should I call you?

121
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:15,003
This is a divine work place for you and me.

122
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,025
Call me, "Sunbae!"

123
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:22,004
Oh.....Sunbae?

124
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,408
How long are you going to just stand there like an idiot?

125
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:27,203
If you're going to learn everything from the basics, every second and minute is precious!

126
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:30,912
Hurry up!

127
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:48,832
Yes!

128
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:52,385
In this house as a maid

129
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:54,344
needs to meet all the needs of her master.

130
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:59,412
There is a list of all these things.

131
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:02,076
ironing a shirt in one minute is a given.

132
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:06,569
Being able to correctly dust expensive artworks.

133
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:13,674
knowing how to organize all the wines.

134
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,268
Chambertin (wrong pronunciation)

135
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:22,922
Chambertin

136
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:28,408
Now, we will memorize the menu.

137
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:36,114
Shrimp carpaccio with white truffle aioli.

138
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:40,011
Shrimp-tu carpa...

139
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:47,033
Skirt steak garnished with asparagus.

140
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:52,414
Aa...As-pa-ra-gam (asparagus)

141
00:14:52,414 --> 00:15:04,726
Roast duck with bell pepper chutney

142
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:10,569
duck?

143
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:28,015
I am hungry! Give me food.

144
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:35,621
Sprinkled basil oil on le...

145
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:36,085
Lentil corn!

146
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:42,439
Lentil corn.

147
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,181
Oh my.

148
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:46,566
Gran...Granny

149
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,734
Grandma, you're still alive?

150
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:52,417
Yes. No matter how you may wish for it, it seems I cannot go.

151
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,944
No, no that's not what I meant.

152
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:58,373
It's because I haven't seen you for so long!

153
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,028
What happened to you?

154
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,866
Didn't you say you were going to run the housekeeping school or something?

155
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,322
The house was such a mess.

156
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:09,606
I couldn't just sit and watch.

157
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:14,828
In the meantime, Butler Lee will be at the school on my behalf.

158
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:19,082
Why? - Is there a problem? - N..No.

159
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:21,648
Who is she?

160
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,306
Is she your student?

161
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,265
Where did you find such a stupid girl that can't even memorize the menu?

162
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:32,005
I took her on as my student because of an unavoidable situation.

163
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,273
I'll introduce her to you.

164
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:39,069
Come here.

165
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:42,337
Nice to meet you.

166
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,539
From now on

167
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:54,001
you will serve Master Jun Pyo here.

168
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:57,013
Please take care of me.

169
00:16:57,013 --> 00:17:02,009
Ge...Geum Jan Di...

170
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:08,799
From today onwards, Geum JanDi will be Master JunPyo's personal maid.

171
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:20,732
Per...Personal! maid?

172
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:24,144
Please...I will do anything else you want me to!

173
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,665
But what's this about Goo JunPyo's personal maid...

174
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,198
What do you mean, "Goo Joon Pyo"?

175
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:33,799
No one can call him like that in this house!

176
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,061
No matter what happens outside,

177
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:38,292
when you're working in this house,

178
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:41,296
call him, "Master"!

179
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,069
Ah...Yes...Yes!

180
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:48,049
So as I was saying, please reconsider this position with 'Master'.

181
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,595
Grandm- Sunbaenim...

182
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:56,029
Please, I am begging you...

183
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,432
Have you already forgotten?

184
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:17,097
It's not something that can be decided just because you wish it.

185
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:22,023
I should not have come here.

186
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:25,521
Maybe it is still okay for me to leave right now.

187
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,063
"i told you to come to me anytime you needed help"

188
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:40,073
"did you forget that we are unni-dongsaeng?

189
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:42,457
oh..Geum JanDi.

190
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:52,009
GooJoonPyo's maid Geum Jandi reply to me now.

191
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:55,379
Goo JunPyo?

192
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,053
Ah..Geum JanDi

193
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:02,009
Report to my room immediately. Over.

194
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,013
What?

195
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:27,085
This guy is really!

196
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:31,041
Hey! What are you doing right now?

197
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:36,835
It took you 3 minutes to get here. Next time make it here in one.

198
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,021
What?

199
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:38,093
You really..

200
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,198
I, Goo JunPyo, command my personal maid Geum JanDi

201
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:46,037
to make delicious ramen right away.

202
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,097
I don't want to!

203
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:51,053
You know I am holding back because of your sister.

204
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:53,093
i want my ramen in 10 minutes.

205
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:57,071
I'm hanging up.

206
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,483
Goo JunPyo..

207
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:05,077
Do you really want to die?

208
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:13,065
Who do you think you are addressing so informally?

209
00:20:13,065 --> 00:21:06,661
Yes sir.

210
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:07,657
What is this?

211
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,757
Gees! The ramyum!

212
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:11,916
that you wanted me to cook, Master.

213
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:27,506
- There's no lid!- What li . . .!

214
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:30,432
Satisfied?

215
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:35,552
- Where are you going?- What do you want now?!...sir?

216
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:49,684
What..what is it?I want you to sit there until I finish.

217
00:21:49,684 --> 00:22:06,037
There is a button on the side, push it.

218
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:10,765
You! I mean . . . master.

219
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,332
What are you trying to do?

220
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,945
It's because the chair is so uncomfortable.

221
00:22:14,945 --> 00:24:32,166
I'm just testing it. Just do as I say and sit.

222
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:38,723
Do you know what time it is?! How is it that you are still asleep?!

223
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:42,249
Hurry over to master's room.

224
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:43,608
WHat?

225
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:57,975
This early?

226
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:58,055
Get out!

227
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:17,123
If you try to wake me up one more time, I will fire you! Got it?

228
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:22,002
Sir JunPyo, don't you think it's time to wake up?

229
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:31,438
Didn't I tell you? I'll fire you if you try to wake me up again? Do you want to die?

230
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:33,423
Goo JunPyo

231
00:25:33,423 --> 00:25:36,532
Get up!

232
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:39,679
How many people have to risk their jobs just to wake you up?

233
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,438
GET UP!

234
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,637
What the!

235
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:46,406
Geum Jan DI

236
00:25:46,406 --> 00:26:21,723
Hey! Okay! I got it, I'll get up! I'm getting up.

237
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:25,537
About firing you . . . I take it back.

238
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:30,788
What? Thank you . . Thank you

239
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:39,008
Satisified?

240
00:26:39,008 --> 00:27:24,104
Thank you Geum Jan Di!

241
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:26,168
Yi Jung.

242
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:28,937
How did you . . . ?

243
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:40,326
I used to be the one hiding, I'm always it so i never get to seek.

244
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,912
It's pretty hard.

245
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,089
Cha Eun-jae

246
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:49,834
Don't you think you hid too well?

247
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:54,772
I was almost about to give up on the game.

248
00:27:54,772 --> 00:28:21,024
Yi Jung ...

249
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:26,163
Why does nothing work for both of us?

250
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,339
What do you think is worse?

251
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,977
Working as a personal maid under your ex-boyfriend,

252
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:39,041
or accidentally putting your crush and his first love together as soon as you gather up the courage to ask him out?

253
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:47,617
I think comparing the two situations is sad in itself.

254
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:49,019
Hello?

255
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,334
Jaekyung unnie..

256
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:52,424
Jandi! Did you move again?

257
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:55,428
Where did your house go? There's not even a trace of it left.

258
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:58,719
Oh yeah. Something came up.

259
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:01,959
So? Where did you go?

260
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,616
Let's have another housewarming party! I'll buy you something good to eat!

261
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:09,534
Gaeul! Let's play truth or dare like the last time, too?

262
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:16,352
Doesn't that sound good? Tell me, where?

263
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:19,852
My house!

264
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:25,025
Jandi is sharing my room with me right now, so I don't think we can hang out like last time. That's why we haven't invited you.

265
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:26,096
We're sorry.

266
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:30,093
Oh I see- I'm glad you're at least with Gaeul.

267
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:33,593
you could have stayed with me, too.

268
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:37,172
Thank you for offering.

269
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:38,895
Oh yeah. Can you pack some porridge for me?

270
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:39,732
Porridge?

271
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:44,169
GuJunpyo is sick?

272
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:44,669
After the trip I had no chance to see Jun but when I called, he said he was sick.

273
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:46,419
I'm going to go visit him.

274
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:47,515
Jun?

275
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:51,774
He was fine this morn-

276
00:29:51,774 --> 00:30:12,062
Jandi. Isn't it time for you to go to the clinic?

277
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:16,016
That's right. You're all done.

278
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:19,307
He's alright. Breathing's good.

279
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:22,572
Even though he has a fever, he's still healthy.

280
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:28,025
Thank you. Good bye.

281
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:45,769
Goodbye

282
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:53,085
Doctor.

283
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:57,042
Grandpa !

284
00:30:57,042 --> 00:31:02,906
Grandpa...are you okay?

285
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:05,674
Ah, I'm all right.

286
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:10,272
I know my own disease.

287
00:31:10,272 --> 00:31:26,021
There's nothing to be worried about.

288
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:29,132
You're not okay.

289
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:34,439
What would have happened if I hadn't been here? This happened last time, too.

290
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:38,876
You can't live by yourself like this

291
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:42,899
So you plan on putting me in a retirement home?

292
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:57,029
Yes. You!!

293
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:03,071
Sunbae...

294
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:09,719
What are you doing here all of a sudden?

295
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,372
What is all this?

296
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:12,096
It's for moving in.

297
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:21,082
Do you have a spare room?

298
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:23,093
Come on, hurry!

299
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:25,627
Come on, hu-

300
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:34,378
Hold on a moment.

301
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:35,867
Come on, hurry!

302
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:55,041
Ah, I don't know what your motive is.

303
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,008
Why don't I see my personal maid?

304
00:32:56,008 --> 00:33:01,519
Pardon? eh Geum Ja-

305
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,426
my new personal maid.

306
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:06,077
Her master is eating and she doesn't even show her face

307
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:08,086
New personal maid?

308
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,968
Today is saturday, sir.

309
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:16,958
So?

310
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,883
So?

311
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:28,243
When Mistress Jun Hee hired Geum...

312
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:33,128
Because of school and her part-time jobs

313
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:37,096
She's only required to work during the 5 weekdays.

314
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:38,874
So..

315
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:41,043
only five days?

316
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:44,726
what kind of maid is that?

317
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:47,521
Sir, Mistress Jaekyung is here.

318
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:48,074
What?!

319
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:56,089
Jun....

320
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:02,881
Our little Jun...Does it hurt? Should I nurse you back to health? Let's eat porridge.

321
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:08,968
Are you sick?

322
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:15,864
here.

323
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:24,066
What are you doing Joonpyo? Your fiancee says to open.

324
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:25,019
Good, you eat well.

325
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:30,078
Does it taste good?

326
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:34,724
Come and sit down.

327
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:40,941
Here is...

328
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:43,188
This is your home now.

329
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,494
YOU!

330
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:47,524
What kind of person does this all of the sudden?

331
00:34:47,524 --> 00:34:51,834
He and I need time to prepare our minds...

332
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,029
You've been doing it for 15 years.

333
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:58,026
Preparing your mind.

334
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:02,754
Was it not enough?

335
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:08,083
Also if you don't listen to me,I might tell him all about it.

336
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,251
About what!?

337
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:15,789
That you are sick

338
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,931
Should I do that?

339
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:24,383
look at you. Where did you learn all these bad things from?

340
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,342
I've been told that

341
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:31,645
That I have good skills in dealing.

342
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:35,825
Good night.

343
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:38,071
JanDi ah...yes..

344
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:42,434
do you think he'll forgive me?

345
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:47,292
What are you so scared of? You're his grandfather.

346
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:53,064
If your grandson doesn't listen, just give him a good beating.

347
00:35:53,064 --> 00:36:33,163
Good night.

348
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:36,293
What do you think you are doing?

349
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:40,687
You and your grandpa needed a family.

350
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:43,821
All i did was helping you guys find it.

351
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:45,075
Geum JanDI..I'm still--

352
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:50,039
You're not ready for it?

353
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,793
Grandpa said the same thing.

354
00:36:54,793 --> 00:37:00,906
For something like this, how much time do you need to prepare...?

355
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:04,928
Isn't that pointless?

356
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:07,088
You said it before,

357
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:12,112
It's impossible to know somebody completely.

358
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:22,953
But you can at least know what kind of person he or she is.

359
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:26,871
The "JiHoo" i know

360
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:32,017
Still loves and misses his grandfather.

361
00:37:32,017 --> 00:38:00,752
So, he's capable of forgiving him.

362
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:04,958
Geum JanDi..Answer me, Geum JanDi..

363
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,083
My personal maid!

364
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:14,728
Don't you think you're a little too absent just because you have the day off? Are you still not in?

365
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:15,825
What do you want!?

366
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:18,672
I'm not supposed to be working right now.

367
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,023
Hurry here right now.

368
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:26,979
I start on Monday at five o'clock. Call me then.

369
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:37,532
You can earn extra money for extra hours.

370
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:42,182
What? Do you want me to make ramen?

371
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:44,324
Huh? what is this?

372
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:47,955
Sit still here.

373
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:49,314
What? WHat is this?

374
00:38:49,314 --> 00:38:55,296
Hold on a minute and just sit still.

375
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:57,083
What is this?

376
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:52,556
It's starting

377
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,057
Leave that there too..

378
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:57,702
Because I told you to study, you're mad, right?

379
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:59,565
No.

380
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:09,144
Be proud that only the elite are allowed to congregate here.

381
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:14,891
I want to leave!

382
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:44,618
Geum JanDi

383
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:45,689
Goo JunPyo..

384
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:49,007
There's a huge problem! A huge problem!

385
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:51,097
Jaekyung unnie..She is walking up here right now.

386
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:58,881
What?

387
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:00,631
What are we going to do? what are going to do now?

388
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:03,074
Why do we have to do anything? Just stay still.

389
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:05,588
It's better this way

390
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,065
- I'll just take this time . . .- Oh shoot! I don't know!

391
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:20,085
Hey! Where are you going?

392
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:25,291
What are you doing?

393
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,065
Why would you go in here?

394
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:29,235
Goo JunPyo..Close the door for me

395
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:36,654
I asked why you'd go in here?

396
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:37,083
Where are you? I'm here.

397
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:50,025
Jun..Jun..

398
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:53,817
So you were in here.

399
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:54,626
Hey Monkey.

400
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:55,645
Don't you sleep?

401
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:58,061
What kind of woman comes to someone else's house in the middle of the night?

402
00:41:58,061 --> 00:41:59,929
You're not "someone else." You're "someone I like."

403
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:01,343
What?

404
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,062
Isn't it funny?

405
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:06,904
My dad always said the words of a popular song has its philosophy.

406
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,229
I didn't know what it meant.

407
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:11,946
But now I so understand it.

408
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,826
Maybe because I'm dating?

409
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:15,394
What dating?

410
00:42:15,394 --> 00:42:17,301
Anyway, why are you here?

411
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:25,033
To spend the night.

412
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:29,735
To watch this together. I wanted to watch this, but I'm too scared to watch it alone.

413
00:42:29,735 --> 00:46:20,166
Good, right? Let's go.

414
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:24,319
I remember you liked this when you were young.

415
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,088
Let's eat

416
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:32,783
I'm not hungry

417
00:46:32,783 --> 00:48:37,256
Then at least take this

418
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:39,503
Jaekyung..How did you

419
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:40,966
JanDi..How could you do this?

420
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:44,179
Why did you lie to me?<Br>I thought you were my best friend.

421
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:49,272
I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life like sisters! How could you do this to me?

422
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:53,004
Jaekyung..That's not it.

423
00:48:53,004 --> 00:48:57,867
I'm sorry..The truth is..

424
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,774
I don't want to hear excuses

425
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:04,136
You lied to me, you hurt me more than you can imagine.

426
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:27,049
Please,listen to me.

427
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:29,736
Jandi! What are you doing today?

428
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:33,028
I'm really sorry- I think i'm busy allllllll day! I'm so busy I don't think I can do anything today-

429
00:49:33,028 --> 00:49:38,121
Right now I'm on my way out

430
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:42,588
Really? okay..bye~

431
00:49:42,588 --> 00:50:14,745
Bye..

432
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,201
Did you two sleep well?

433
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,637
What are you doing here?

434
00:50:18,637 --> 00:50:21,072
so early in the morning?

435
00:50:21,072 --> 00:50:31,803
Ah me? I came to go to work with you two!

436
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:36,714
Well since it's the three of us, let's take the car.

437
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:42,095
Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go!

438
00:50:42,095 --> 00:50:43,506
Here, ma'am...

439
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:55,522
Be careful, it's hot.

440
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:58,866
Oh! It's normal temperature.

441
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:00,012
Here you go...

442
00:51:00,012 --> 00:51:08,505
Grandma! Grandma!

443
00:51:08,505 --> 00:51:15,088
I don't want to! :p

444
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:19,075
Mrs. Min...

445
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:36,272
Oh hold on a minute.

446
00:51:36,272 --> 00:51:37,762
Sunbae ! Sunbae !

447
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:44,092
-Please give us some tea.- We didn't drink tea either.

448
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:53,828
How did you get so handsome?

449
00:51:53,828 --> 00:52:11,121
I think I'll drink a cup too.

450
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:23,085
Yes, it's good.

451
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:34,435
You can exit this way.

452
00:52:34,435 --> 00:54:16,026
Please wait a little bit.

453
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:18,586
It has been a while since I have been here.

454
00:54:18,586 --> 00:54:24,724
do you remember getting in trouble from playing hide and seek in here.

455
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:30,079
Of course. I had to clean for a week as punishment.

456
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:37,106
Right. And you said you were cold so we tried to heat it up and we got in trouble again.

457
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:40,398
You were the one who told me you were cold.

458
00:54:40,398 --> 00:54:43,924
No way! It was you!

459
00:54:43,924 --> 00:54:55,941
no... was it me?

460
00:54:55,941 --> 00:55:01,661
Your mother, is she well?

461
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:03,882
She's still the same.

462
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:07,017
Do you want to know about my dad as well?.

463
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:12,659
What about you? You have been well right?

464
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:15,703
Are you curious?

465
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:20,079
Are you really curious?

466
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,558
Why did you do it?

467
00:55:21,558 --> 00:55:22,743
Do what?

468
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:25,799
How could you do that all of the sudden?

469
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:30,041
Without a warning...How could you disappear like that?

470
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:34,941
Do you know how I felt?

471
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:40,061
I felt suffocated--as though the air I breathed was all gone.

472
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:47,009
Can you imagine how I felt?

473
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:50,902
How could you have done that to me?

474
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:54,047
I wasn't the air

475
00:55:54,047 --> 00:55:55,403
What?

476
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:59,352
I..I wasn't your air..YiJung

477
00:55:59,352 --> 00:56:06,889
I was just a breeze that you mistook for air.

478
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:11,304
I thought of myself the same way, Yijung.

479
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:18,209
I thought, if i wanted to, I could stay at your side forever.

480
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:22,004
What are you trying to say?

481
00:56:22,004 --> 00:57:02,073
A breeze.. Once it passes by, it can't come back to the same place..YiJung ah

482
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:09,907
Why are you being like this?

483
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:21,743
Oh, it' you GaEul.. I want to sleep. Can we talk later?

484
00:57:21,743 --> 00:57:27,965
Sunbae..How could you act so much better than me back then when now you've become like this?

485
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:31,474
Can you shut up and leave?

486
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:34,713
No, if i shut up now,

487
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:43,177
I'll probably have to watch you spend your life in this condition, so I think I'll say a few more things.

488
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:45,998
Sunbae....You're a liar.</br>

489
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:48,088
You're immature

490
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:51,049
a pathetic coward.

491
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:52,711
What did you say?

492
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,715
You said you pretended because you didn't want to hurt her, right?

493
00:57:55,715 --> 00:58:01,641
No, ιt was you, sunbae, who didn't want to get hurt.

494
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:04,832
You thought that she'll see you for what you are and that she'd run away--

495
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:05,903
Chu GaEul.

496
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:14,576
I know. Your cool and collected self is just a mask.

497
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:19,617
But the Yijung that I like... He's afraid of love.

498
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:53,106
He's afraid of people leaving, just like a child.

499
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:58,775
Children.. in front of what they really want, they don't hesitate.

500
00:58:58,775 --> 00:59:29,547
Because if they lose it.. they know they'll start crying.

501
00:59:29,547 --> 00:59:32,282
Thank you for today.

502
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:35,946
You got to do more things for the first time because of me again, right?

503
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:37,906
Get in. I'll take you home.

504
00:59:37,906 --> 01:00:00,372
No. I can go alone.

505
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:05,988
Aigoo, it must be heavy.

506
01:00:05,988 --> 01:00:08,339
Doctor, let's go

507
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:12,362
Work time is over so i'm now "grandpa"

508
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:15,314
Drive home safely, Grandpa.

509
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:32,816
Put on your seatbelt!. Ok.

510
01:00:32,816 --> 01:00:39,019
Drive safely!

511
01:00:39,019 --> 01:01:16,031
Drive safely!!

512
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:20,172
Sir

513
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:38,279
Master!

514
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:43,059
Sir, it is time to wake up sir.

515
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:45,201
You should wake up now.

516
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:50,817
Sir..

517
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:51,097
Sir... SIR!!!

518
01:01:51,097 --> 01:01:54,945
You..

519
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:55,081
You..What are you..

520
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:56,904
Five minutes.

521
01:01:56,904 --> 01:02:05,524
Let me stay like this for five minutes, then I'll get up.

522
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:07,051
Even when I'm holding you like this

523
01:02:07,051 --> 01:02:19,016
I can't believe you're really here

524
01:02:19,016 --> 01:02:21,119
Jun..I'm here!

525
01:02:21,119 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's..

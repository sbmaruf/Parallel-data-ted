1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440


2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,570
The whole process of natural
selection is to some degree

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,690
dependent on the idea of
variation, that within any

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,450
population of a species, you
have some genetic variation.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,630
So, for example, let's say I
have a bunch of-- well, this

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,500
is a circle species, and one guy
is that color, and then I

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,960
got a bunch more, maybe some
are that color-- oh, that's

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
the same color-- that one, and
that one, and that one.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,630
And for whatever reason,
sometimes there are no

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,030
environmental factors that will
predispose one of these

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,800
guys to be able to survive and
reproduce over the other, but

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,530
every now and then, there might
be some environmental

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,620
factor, and it makes maybe, all
of a sudden, this guy more

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,090
fit to reproduce.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,170
And so for whatever reason, this
guy is able to reproduce

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,820
more frequently and these
guys less frequently.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,140
And some of them get killed,
or whatever, or eaten by

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,460
birds, or whatever, or they're
just not able to reproduce for

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,070
whatever reason, and then maybe
these guys are something

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,860
in between.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,960
So over time, the frequency of
the different traits you see

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
in this population
will change.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,710
And if they are drastic enough,
maybe these guys start

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,910
becoming dominant and start not
liking these guys, because

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,330
they're so different
or whatever else.

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,110
We could see a lot of
different reasons.

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,460
This could eventually turn
into a different species.

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,760
Now, the obvious question is
what leads to this variation?

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,520
In a population what leads to
this-- in fact, even in our

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,710
population, what leads to one
person having dirty blonde

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,490
hair, one person having brown
hair, one person having black

32
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,630
hair, and we have the spectrum
of skin complexions and

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,590
heights is pretty
much infinite.

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,900
What causes that?

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,930
And then one thing that I kind
of point to, we talked about

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,500
this a little bit in
the DNA video, is

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,440
this notion of mutations.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,310
DNA, we learned, is just a
sequence of these bases.

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,430
So adenine, guanine, let's say
I've got some thymine going.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,990
I have some more adenine,
some cytosine.

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,780
And that these code, if you have
enough of these in a row,

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,030
maybe you have a few hundred
or a few thousand of these,

43
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,720
these code for proteins or
they code for things that

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,020
control other proteins,
but maybe you have a

45
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,770
change in one of them.

46
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,330
Maybe this cytosine for whatever
reason becomes a

47
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,270
guanine randomly, or maybe these
got deleted, and that

48
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,820
would change the DNA.

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,150
But you could imagine, if I
went to someone's computer

50
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,220
code and just randomly started
changing letters and randomly

51
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,480
started inserting letters
without really knowing what

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,790
I'm doing, most of the time,
I'm going to break the

53
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,060
computer program.

54
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,800
Most of the time, the great
majority of the time, this is

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,050
going to go nowhere.

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,150


57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,390
It'll either do nothing, for
example, if I go into

58
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,240
someone's computer program and
if I just add a couple of

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,190
spaces or something, that might
not change the computer

60
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,200
program, but if I start getting
rid of semicolons and

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,610
start changing numbers and all
that, it'll probably make the

62
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,840
computer program break.

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,050
So it'll either do nothing or
it'll actually kill the

64
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,600
organisms most of the time.

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,730
Mutations: sometimes, they might
make the actual cell

66
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,060
kind of run amok, and we'll do a
whole maybe series of videos

67
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,920
on cancer, and that itself
obviously would hurt the

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,840
organism as well as a whole,
although if it occurs after

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,500
the organism has reproduced, it
might not be something that

70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,750
selects against the organism
and it also

71
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,930
wouldn't be passed on.

72
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,790
But anyway, I won't go
detailed into that.

73
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,470
But the whole point is that
mutations don't seem to be a

74
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,470
satisfying source
of variation.

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,350
They could be a source or kind
of contribute on the margin,

76
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,910
but there must be something more
profound than mutations

77
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,970
that's creating the diversity
even within, or maybe I should

78
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,280
call it the variation, even
within a population.

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,800
And the answer here is
really it's kind of

80
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,710
right in front of us.

81
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,300
It really addresses kind of one
of the most fundamental

82
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,260
things about biology, and it's
so fundamental that a lot of

83
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,790
people never even question
why it is the way it is.

84
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,910
And that is sexual
reproduction.

85
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:59,460


86
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,670
And when I mean sexual
reproduction, it's this notion

87
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,870
that you have, and pretty much
if you look at all organisms

88
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,680
that have nucleuses-- and we
call those eukaroytes.

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,780
Maybe I'll do a whole video on
eukaryotes versus prokaryotes,

90
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,050
but it's the notion that if you
look universally all the

91
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,190
way from plants-- not
universally, but if you look

92
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,640
at cells that have nucleuses,
they almost universally have

93
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,640
this phenomenon that you have
males and you have females.

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,510
In some organisms, an organism
can be both a male and a

95
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,920
female, but the common idea
here is that all organisms

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,530
kind of produce versions of
their genetic material that

97
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,960
mix with other organisms'
version of

98
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,140
their genetic material.

99
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,410
If mutations were the only
source of variation, then I

100
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,900
could just bud off other Sals.

101
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,640
Maybe just other Sals would just
bud off from me, and then

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,550
randomly one Sal might be a
little bit different and

103
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,320
whatever else.

104
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,630
But that would, as we already
talked about, most of the

105
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,730
time, we would have very little
change, very little

106
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,500
variation, and whatever
variation does occur because

107
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,160
of any kind of noise being
introduced into this kind of

108
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,650
budding process where I just
replicate myself identically,

109
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,100
most of the time it'll
be negative.

110
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,790
Most of the time, it'll
break the organism.

111
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,660
Now, when you have sexual
reproduction, what happens?

112
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,380
Well, you keep mixing and
matching every possible

113
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:35,750
combination of DNA in a kind
of species pool of DNA.

114
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,510
So let me make this a little
bit more concrete for you.

115
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,780
So let me erase this horrible
drawing I just did.

116
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,300
So we all have-- let me stick
to humans because

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,550
that's what we are.

118
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,880


119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,700
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes,
and in each pair,

120
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,210
we have one chromosome from our
mother and one chromosome

121
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,550
from our father.

122
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,470
So let me draw that.

123
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,890
So I'll draw my father's
chromosomes in blue.

124
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:15,270
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15--

125
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm running out of space.

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:25,410
Let me do more here-- 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then

127
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,770
I'll throw another one
here that looks

128
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,970
a little bit different.

129
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,660
I'll throw one here that looks
like a Y, and we'll talk more

130
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,340
about the X's and the
Y chromosomes.

131
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,870
Then I have 23 chromosomes
from my mother.

132
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,470
And not to be stereotypical,
but maybe I'll do that in a

133
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,220
more feminine color.

134
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,360
Let's see, so I have 23
chromosomes from my mother.

135
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:56,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,740
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

137
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,730
So what's going on here?

138
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,870
I have 23 from my mother.

139
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,620
I have 23 from my father.

140
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,070
Now, each of these chromosomes,
and I made them

141
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,320
right next to each other.

142
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,870
So let me zoom in on
one pair of these.

143
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,390
So let's say we look at
chromosome number-- I'll just

144
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,340
call this chromosome number 3.

145
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,150
So let me zoom in on chromosome
number 3.

146
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,330
I have one from my mother
right here.

147
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,650
Actually, maybe I'll
do it this way.

148
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,230
Remember, chromosome is just a
big-- if you take the DNA, the

149
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,930
DNA just keeps wrapping around,
and it actually wraps

150
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,100
around all these proteins, and
it creates this structure, but

151
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,430
it's just a big-- when you see
it like that, you're like, oh,

152
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,860
maybe the DNA-- no, but this
could have millions of base

153
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,010
pair, so maybe it'll look
something like that.

154
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,100
It's a densely wrapped version
of-- well, it's a long string

155
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,230
of DNA, and when it's normally
drawn like this, which is not

156
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,640
always the way it is, and we'll
talk more about that,

157
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
they draw it as densely
packed like that.

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,170
So let's say that's
from my mother and

159
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,990
that's from my father.

160
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:21,120
Now, let's call this
chromosome 3.

161
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,680
They're both chromosome 3.

162
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,270
And what the idea here is that
I'm getting different traits

163
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,410
from my father and
from my mother.

164
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,990
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification here, but

165
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,620
this is really just to
give you the idea of

166
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,070
what's going on.

167
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,820
This chromosome 3, maybe
it contains this

168
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,460
trait for hair color.

169
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,930
And maybe my father had-- and
I'll use my actual example.

170
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,470
My father had very
straight hair.

171
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,530
So someplace on this chromosome,
there's a gene for

172
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,470
hair straightness.

173
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,210
Let's say it's a little
thing right there.

174
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,610
And remember, that gene could
be thousands of base pairs,

175
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,540
but let's say this is
hair straightness.

176
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,360
So my father's version of that
gene, he had the allele for

177
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,800
straightness.

178
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,230
And remember, an allele is just
a version of a gene, so

179
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,800
I'll call it the allele straight
for straight hair.

180
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,580


181
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,770
Now, this other chromosome that
my mother gave me, this

182
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,150
essentially, and there are
exceptions, but for the most

183
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,750
part, it codes for the same
genes, and that's why I put

184
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,860
them next to each other.

185
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,210
So this will also have the gene
for hair straightness or

186
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,520
curlyness, but my mom
does happen to

187
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,600
actually have curly hair.

188
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,250
So she has the gene right
there for curly hair.

189
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,700
The version of the gene
here is allele curly.

190
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,610
The gene just says, look, this
is the gene for whether or not

191
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,600
your hair is curly.

192
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Each version of the gene
is called an allele.

193
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,640
Allele curly.

194
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,690
Now, when I got both of these in
my body or in my cells, and

195
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,040
this is in every cell of my
body, every cell of my body

196
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,080
except for, and we'll talk in
a few seconds about my germ

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,330
cells, but every cells other
than the ones that I use for

198
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,060
reproduction have this complete
set of chromosomes in

199
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,330
it, which I find amazing.

200
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,690
But only certain chromosomes--
for example, these genes will

201
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,360
be completely useless in my
fingernails, because all of a

202
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
sudden, the straight and the
curly don't matter that much.

203
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,880
And I'm simplifying.

204
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,980
Maybe they will on some
other dimension.

205
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,700
But let's say for simplicity,
they won't

206
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,850
matter in certain places.

207
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,240
So certain genes are expressed
in certain parts of the body,

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
but every one of your body
cells, and we call those

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,980
somatic cells, and we'll
separate those from the sex

210
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,050
sells or the germs that we'll
talk about later.

211
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,060
So this is my body cells.

212
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,220
So this is the great majority
of your cells, and this is

213
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,030
opposed to your germ cells.

214
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,080
And the germ cells-- I'll just
write it here, just so you get

215
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,950
a clear-- for a male, that's
the sperm cells, and for

216
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,210
female that's the egg
cells, or the ova.

217
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,550


218
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,310
But most of my cells have a
complete collection of these,

219
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,370
and what I want to give you
the idea is that for every

220
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,200
trait, I essentially have two
versions: one from my mother

221
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,630
and one from my father.

222
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,065
Now, these right here are called
homologous chromosomes.

223
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:25,780


224
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,840
What that means is every time
you see this prefix homologous

225
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,850
or if you see like Homo sapiens
or even the word

226
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,110
homosexual or homogeneous,
it means same, right?

227
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,640
You see that all the time.

228
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,990
So homologous means that they're
almost the same.

229
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,230
They're coding for the most part
the same set of genes,

230
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,100
but they're not identical.

231
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,950
They actually might code for
slightly different versions of

232
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,660
the same gene.

233
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,920
So depending on what versions
I get, what is actually

234
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,120
expressed for me, so my
genotype-- let me introduce

235
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,940
another word, and
I'm overwhelming

236
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,490
you with words here.

237
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:17,630
So my genotype is exactly what
alleles I have, what versions

238
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,170
of the gene.

239
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,210
So I got like the fifth version
of the curly allele.

240
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,850
There could be multiple versions
of the curly allele

241
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,490
in our gene pool.

242
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,820
And maybe I got some version
of the straight allele.

243
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,980
That is my genotype.

244
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,170
My phenotype is what my hair
really looks like.

245
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,720
So, for example, two people
could have different genotypes

246
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,880
with the same-- they might
code for hair that looks

247
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
pretty much the same,
so it might have a

248
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,870
very similar phenotype.

249
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,980
So one phenotype can be

250
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,640
represented by multiple genotypes.

251
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,690
So that's just one thing to
think about, and we'll talk a

252
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,780
lot about that in the future,
but I just wanted to introduce

253
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,380
you to that there.

254
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,200
Now, I entered this whole
discussion because I wanted to

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,430
talk about variation.

256
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,570
So how does variation happen?

257
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,130
Well, what's going to happen
when I-- well, let

258
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,640
me put it this way.

259
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,290
What's going to happen
when I reproduce?

260
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,990
And I have. I have a son.

261
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,160
Well, my contribution to my son
is going to be a random

262
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,530
collection of half
of these genes.

263
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,830
For each homologous pair, I'm
either going to contribute the

264
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,740
one that I got from my mother or
the one that I got from my

265
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,250
father, right?

266
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:37,360
So let's say that the sperm cell
that went on to fertilize

267
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,440
my wife's egg, let's say it
happened to have that one,

268
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,400
that one, or I could
just pick one from

269
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,830
each of these 23 sets.

270
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,020
And you say, well, how many
combinations are there?

271
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:56,240
Well, for every set, I could
pick one of the two homologous

272
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,550
chromosomes, and I'm going
to do that 23 times.

273
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,360
2 times 2 times 2, so that's
2 to the twenty third.

274
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,220
So 2 to the 23 different
versions that I can contribute

275
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,800
to any son or daughter that I
might have. We'll talk about

276
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,310
how that happens when we talk
about meiosis or mitosis, that

277
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,660
when I generate my sperm cells,
sperm cells essentially

278
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,590
takes one-- instead of having
23 pairs of chromosomes in

279
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,540
sperm, you only have
23 chromosomes.

280
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,760
So, for example, I'll take one
from each of those, and

281
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,030
through the process of meiosis,
which we'll go into,

282
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,200
I'll generate a bunch
of sperm cells.

283
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,740
And each sperm cell will have
one from each of these pairs,

284
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,440
one version from each
of those pairs.

285
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,980
So maybe for this chromosome I
get it from my dad, from the

286
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,370
next chromosome, I get
it from my mom.

287
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,840
Then I donate a couple more
from-- I should've drawn them

288
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,820
next to each other.

289
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,580
I donate a couple more
from my mom.

290
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,540
Then for chromosome number 5,
it comes from my dad, and so

291
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,200
on and so forth.

292
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
But there's 2 to the
twenty-third combinations

293
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,240
here, because there
are 23 pairs that

294
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,290
I'm collecting from.

295
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,530
Now, my wife's egg is going to
have the same situation.

296
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,600
There are 2 to the 23 different
combinations of DNA

297
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,730
that she can contribute just
based on which of the

298
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,590
homologous pairs she
will contribute.

299
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,390
So the possible combinations
that just one couple can

300
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:34,990
produce, and I'm using my life
as an example, but this

301
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,980
applies to everything.

302
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,430
This applies to every species
that experiences sexual

303
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,190
reproduction.

304
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,280
So if I can give 2 to
twenty-third combinations of

305
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,620
DNA and my wife can give 2 to
the 23 combinations of DNA,

306
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,240
then we can produce 2 to the
forty-sixth combinations.

307
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,220
Now, just to give an idea of how
large of a number this is,

308
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,560
this is roughly 12,000 times the
number of human beings on

309
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,490
the planet today.

310
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,210
So there's a huge amount of
variation that even one couple

311
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,270
can produce.

312
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,260
And if you thought that even
that isn't enough, it turns

313
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,560
out that amongst these
homologous pairs, and we'll

314
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,510
talk about when this happens in
meiosis, you can actually

315
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,630
have DNA recombination.

316
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,450
And all that means is when these
homologous pairs during

317
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,730
meiosis line up near each other,
you can have this thing

318
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,340
called crossover, where all of
this DNA here crosses over and

319
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,430
touches over here, and all
this DNA crosses over and

320
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,200
touches over there.

321
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,550
So all of this goes there and
all of this goes there.

322
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,010
What you end up with after the
crossover is that one DNA, the

323
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,980
one that came from my mom, or
that I thought came from my

324
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,980
mom, now has a chunk that came
from my dad, and the chunk

325
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,150
that came from my dad, now has a
chunk that came from my mom.

326
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,700
Let me do that in
the right color.

327
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,110
It came from my mom like that.

328
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,980
And so that even increases the
amount of variety even more.

329
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,329
So you can almost now, instead
of talking about the different

330
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,140
chromosomes that you're
contributing where the

331
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,359
chromosomes are each of these
collections of DNA, you're now

332
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,579
talking about-- you can almost
go to the different

333
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,700
combinations at the gene level,
and now you can think

334
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,410
about it in almost infinite
form of variation.

335
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,910
You can think about all of the
variation that might emerge

336
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,720
when you start mixing and
matching different versions of

337
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,560
the same gene in a population.

338
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,150
And you don't just
look at one gene.

339
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,350
I mean, the reality is that
genes by themselves very

340
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,290
seldom code for a specific-- you
can very seldom look for

341
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,330
one gene and say, oh, that is
brown hair, or look for one

342
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,330
gene and say, oh, that's
intelligence, or that is how

343
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,550
likable someone is.

344
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,020
It's usually a whole set of
genes interacting in an

345
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,840
incredibly complicated way.

346
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,430
You know, hair might be coded
for by this whole set of genes

347
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,720
on multiple chromosomes and
this might be coded for a

348
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
whole set of genes on multiple
chromosomes.

349
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,630
And so then you can start
thinking about all of the

350
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,690
different combinations.

351
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,500
And then all of a sudden, maybe
some combination that

352
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,190
never existed before all of a
sudden emerges, and that's

353
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,450
very successful.

354
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,020
But I'll leave you to think
about it because maybe that

355
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,770
combination might be passed on,
or it may not be passed on

356
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,580
because of this recombination.

357
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,480
But we'll talk more about
that in the future.

358
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,720
But I wanted to introduce this
idea of sexual reproduction to

359
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,690
you, because this really is the
main source of variation

360
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,080
within a population.

361
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,730
To me, it's kind of a
philosophical idea, because we

362
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,580
almost take the idea of having
males and females for granted

363
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,080
because it's this
universal idea.

364
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
But I did a little reading on
it, and it turns out that this

365
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,310
actually only emerged about 1.4
billion years ago, that

366
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,820
this is almost a useful trait,
because once you introduce

367
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,360
this level of variation, the
natural selection can start--

368
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,300
you can kind of say that when
you have this more powerful

369
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,910
form of variation than just pure
mutations, and maybe you

370
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,540
might have some primitive form
of crossover before, but now

371
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,220
that you have this sexual
reproduction and you have this

372
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,980
variation, natural selection
can occur in a

373
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,320
more efficient way.

374
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,510
So that species that were able
to reproduce and essentially

375
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,650
recombine their DNA and mix and
match it in this way were

376
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,060
able to produce more variety and
were able to essentially

377
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,120
be selected for their
environment in a more

378
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,740
efficient way so they started
to essentially outnumber the

379
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,050
ones that couldn't, so it
became a kind of very

380
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,720
universal trait.

381
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,760
But you could have imagined a
world, and there are science

382
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,180
fiction books written about
this, where you have three

383
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,160
genders, where you have gender
one, two, three.

384
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,410
You could have 10 genders.

385
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,040
It just happens to be that on
Earth, this notion of having

386
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,750
two genders turned out to be a
very efficient and stable way

387
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,640
of introducing variation
into a population.

388
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,070
So, hopefully, you found
that interesting.

389
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,140
In the next video, I'll go more
into the detail of how

390
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,790
exactly meiosis and
mitosis works.

391
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,843

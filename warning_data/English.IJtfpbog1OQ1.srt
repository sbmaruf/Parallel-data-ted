00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:05,982
Sociolab Concursos

2
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:07,382
is a platform for entrepreneurship

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:07,920
and social inovation

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,375
that brings together the public sector, private sector, students and

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,969
the most vulnerable families in society.

6
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,616
The objective is to develop

7
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:18,140
products, services and business models

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,557
which provide effective solutions to the problems faced by

9
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:24,307
people who are socially excluded

10
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:27,316
due to either lack of resources or lack of opportunities.

11
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:28,945
How can you join in?

12
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,724
This process starts with a challenge:

13
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:33,507
That's to say, a question without an answer.

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,592
In the first stage  "ideation", the users share their ideas with the community.

15
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:41,415
It is not necessary that the idea is fully developed, or that you are an expert in the field

16
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:44,343
a sentence is enough

17
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:48,581
you can add images or video if this will help to communicate your idea

18
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,510
the more evolved your idea is

19
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,593
the more evolved the feedback will be

20
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,894
The community is you

21
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:56,457
and all the other members of Sociolab Concurso.

22
00:00:56,518 --> 00:01:00,779
the community votes, comments on, and helps to develop the ideas that it likes most.

23
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,196
at the same time, a group of mentors

24
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:05,678
comprised of professionals and members of the public

25
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:09,611
support and select, together with the community, the best ideas.

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,864
Their votes carry a 30% weighting of the total.

27
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:16,075
The best ideas then go on to the "co-creation" stage,

28
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:19,608
where, together with the user, they validate or invalidate the remodeled design.

29
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:22,396
Once these ideas have been improved and redesigned,

30
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:28,094
a sustainable business model is designed

31
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:30,323
then the ideas are tested, presented and evaluated

32
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,553
thereby detecting the entrepreneurs of the future,

33
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:36,068
which we fund in the final stage of implementation and scaling up.

34
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:39,983
This is how Sociolab works.

35
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:45,679
The biggest platform for social innovation in Latin America, aiming to change the world with dignity.

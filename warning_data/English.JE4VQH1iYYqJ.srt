1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,890
We've seen a reasonable
number of acid

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,390
reactions and base reactions.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,160
So let's just write down a few
of them for review and let's

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,450
see if we can see a general
pattern here.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,630
And a lot of this might not
be any news to you.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,990
So if we have hydrogen flouride,
or if it's in an

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,110
aqueous solution it's
hydrofluoric acid.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,320
We know that this is a weak
acid-- it doesn't disassociate

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,850
completely.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,930
So it's in equilibrium.

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,090
Some type of equilibrium.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,860
That doesn't mean the
concentrations are equal.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,110
This hydrogen disassociates.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,080
Actually, we know in reality,
it tags a ride along with

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,700
another water molecule
and forms hydronium.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,760
And then you have-- and, of
course, this is still aqueous.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,330
Everything is going
on inside water.

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,090
And then you have left over
your fluoride anion, or

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,940
negative ion.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,650
And that's also in an
aqueous solution.

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,000
And we could have rewritten--
actually, let me write another

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,210
reaction here, just so you can
see the general pattern.

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,500
Let me write another
acidic reaction.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,720
Let me write ammonium.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,820
So that's NH4 plus-- it's
ammonia with an extra hydrogen

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,600
in an-- let me just write that--
in an aqueous solution.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,400
That can disassociate to one of
those hydrogens popping off

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,790
in an aqueous solution.

29
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,120
And then you have
ammonia, NH3.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,190
That's also in an aqueous
solution.

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,480
Now both of these describe an
equilibrium reaction, but it

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,110
kind of implies that we're
dealing with weak acids.

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,360
You take an acid, and they're
producing hydrogen, which is

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,700
at least the Arrhenius
definition of an acid if you

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,560
looked at the Bronsted-Lowry
definition where they're

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,920
donating protons to
the solution.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,410
They're creating hyrdonium,
they're donating protons to

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,180
the water around it.

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,330
But it kind of describes
it as an acid.

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,940
But we know it's a weak acid,
so this reaction goes in two

41
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,370
directions.

42
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,310
So we can write the same
reaction essentially as a

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,050
basic reaction.

44
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,550
So we can-- instead of saying
hydrofluoric acid is our

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,790
acid-- we could say hey, if I
just have a fluoride anion, if

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,140
I just have a negative fluoride
here, I could say a

47
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,430
negative fluoride, if I put
that in-- actually, I keep

48
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,370
making that same mistake.

49
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,290
The fluorine does not
have an l in it.

50
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,520
I do that because
chloride does.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,690
Let me erase this.

52
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,860
Hydrogen fluoride is HF.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,830
So it's just F there.

54
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,440
Let me go to the
periodic table.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,910
See, I always confused fluorine
with chlorine because

56
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,490
F is just for flourine.

57
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,780
But you get the point.

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,090
OK.

59
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,260
So I could rewrite the same
weak acid equilibrium as a

60
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,730
weak base equilibrium.

61
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,150
Or I could say a negative
fluorine anion in an aqueous

62
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,610
solution is in equilibrium
with-- and now we're saying

63
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,810
I'm considering this a base,
which means that it's going to

64
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:11,800
increase the concentration
of OH.

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,310
So what this might want to do is
it might want to grab some

66
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,240
hydrogen from some of
the water that's

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,290
in the aqueous solution.

68
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:25,120
So it grabs some hydrogen and
becomes hydrogen flouride, or

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,010
hydrofluoric acid.

70
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,680
Let me do that in that
magenta color.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,190
It's aqueous.

72
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,210
And where did it get
this hydrogen from?

73
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,230
Well, it got it from one of
the surrounding water

74
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,420
molecules, which was H2O.

75
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,540
Since it gave away one
of the hydrogens now

76
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,630
it's just OH minus.

77
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,290
So the surrounding water
molecule is OH minus aqueous.

78
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,680
Now these might look
different.

79
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:00,750
This is donating a hydrogen to
the surrounding medium, and

80
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,940
then you're left with just
the fluorine molecule.

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,980
Well, this is essentially
creating a hydroxide molecule

82
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,750
out of the surrounding medium so
it looks basic, but if you

83
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,390
think about it, these reactions
are the same.

84
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,020
I mean, you could have just
gone in reverse direction.

85
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,190
You could say, hey, this is
going to react with some

86
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,540
random hydronium molecule or
some random, free-standing

87
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,520
proton out there.

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,730
And then it could form hydrogen
fluoride, but we know

89
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,020
that hydronium isn't just
sitting everywhere, that

90
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,570
whenever you take the reverse
reaction, whenever you're

91
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,500
going in this direction this
doesn't have to grab this

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,130
hydrogen from an H3O.

93
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,840
It could grab it from an H2O.

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,270
And then you would have
this reaction.

95
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,500
These are equivalent.

96
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,250
And we could do the same thing
here for ammonium and amonia.

97
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,160
We could write ammonia
as a base.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,000
NH3 is in equilibrium as a weak
base with-- it can grab a

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,460
hydrogen from its surrounding
medium and become NH4 plus in

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,920
an aqueous solution.

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,010
And then it would have grabbed
that hydrogen, probably from a

102
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,430
water molecule because that's
what's around it.

103
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,230
And so that water molecule
will become an OH minus.

104
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,470
And so now this looks ammonia
is a weak base.

105
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,960
Ammonium is a weak acid.

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
But these are equivalent
reactions.

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,470
Now, you're probably already
seeing a relationship here.

108
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,940
Ammonium is a weak acid.

109
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,680
Ammonia is a weak base.

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,570
And what's the difference
between the two?

111
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,810
Just an H.

112
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,760
Hydrofluoric acid is a weak
acid, just a fluorine anion.

113
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,090
A negative fluorine
is a weak base.

114
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,580
And what's the difference
between the two?

115
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,870
They're just difference
of a hydrogen.

116
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,880
Let me write that down.

117
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,130
So let me write weak acid.

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,235
And then you have
your weak base.

119
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,150
So your weak base-- let me write
our weak acid is first.

120
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,750
We had hydrofluoric acid, and
then the weak base is when you

121
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,930
essentially just dump
the hydrogen, just

122
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,320
the hydrogen proton.

123
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,480
You kept the electron, so that's
why it's a negative

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,880
charge right there.

125
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,180
Hydrogen without its one
electron is just a proton

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,010
because it has no neutrons.

127
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:26,500
The other one was NH4 plus.

128
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,150
You dump one of the hydrogens
and you get NH3.

129
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,200
So what's the difference
going on?

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,160
These are all minus
a hydrogen.

131
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,700
Or if you go this way, you're
plus a hydrogen.

132
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,400
So you have these kind
of conjugates.

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
And this has all been a
long-winded way of introducing

134
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,020
you to this idea that you have
these conjugate pairs.

135
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,230
Like hydrofluoric acid, or
hydrogen fluoride and just the

136
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,960
fluorine anions.

137
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,675
So these are conjugate pairs.

138
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,960
Which are essentially two
molecules that are identical

139
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,070
except for a difference
in one hydrogen.

140
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,860
No more than one hydrogen.

141
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,720
One day there might be a test
where someone shows you two

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,070
molecules that are separated by
two hydrogens-- those would

143
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,940
not be conjugate pairs.

144
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,980
For example, if I show you H2O
and OH minus, these are

145
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,220
conjugate pairs.

146
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,660
Because this over here is
exactly this minus a proton.

147
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,500
And, in fact, let me be clear
that it's not just minus the

148
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,850
hydrogen-- minus the proton.

149
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,630
One of them is keeping
the electron.

150
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,150
So this is minus a hydrogen
proton, this is plus a

151
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,160
hydrogen proton.

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,420
So the difference between
these two are

153
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,320
just a hydrogen proton.

154
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,730
So these are conjugate pairs.

155
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:58,410
Now, if I were to say that H3O
and OH minus, you might be

156
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,580
tempted to say, hey, this is
very acidic, this is a base,

157
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,720
this is a conjugate pair.

158
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,630
But no, there's a 2 H,
2 proton difference.

159
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,160
This is H3O plus.

160
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,980
There's a 2 proton difference,
so these are

161
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,815
not conjugate pairs.

162
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,410
So let me just cross that out.

163
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,510
But these are.

164
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,200
Now, you could say, if you have
H3O, you might say, hey,

165
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,650
what's the conjugate base-- and
that's a new word I just

166
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,350
introduced you to-- what's the
conjugate base for H3O if H3O

167
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,179
is an acid?

168
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,080
Well, you take one H from
it and you get H2O.

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,510
So this is a conjugate pair.

170
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,150
And I just said a word without
defining it, so now

171
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,050
let me define it.

172
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,050
Within every conjugate pair you
have an acid and a base.

173
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,740
And if you say, oh, what is
the conjugate base for

174
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,580
hydrofluoric acid, you get rid
of a hydrogen and you say, oh,

175
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,350
it's just this fluorine anion.

176
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,760
If you said, I have some of
ammonia, as a base, what is

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,310
its conjugate acid?

178
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,350
So if someone asks you, what is
a conjugate acid, you add a

179
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,980
hydrogen proton to it and
you get ammonium.

180
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,280
So I could call these
the conjugate acid.

181
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,590
Let me just change terminology--
conjugate.

182
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,130
And we'll see that actually, you
don't have to be using a

183
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,150
weak acid or a weak base.

184
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:31,070
Conjugate acid, and then you
have a conjugate base.

185
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,440
And even though something might
be a conjugate acid or

186
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,340
conjugate base, it doesn't
necessarily mean that they're

187
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,740
very basic, for example,
or very acidic.

188
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,870
If I have hydrogen chloride, we
know this is a strong acid.

189
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,990
Hydrogen chloride.

190
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,460
Its conjugate base, we
essentially just get rid of

191
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,090
one of these hydrogen protons--
it doesn't take its

192
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,480
electron with it.

193
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
So it's just going to be the
chlorine negative ion.

194
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,300
This is its conjugate.

195
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,280
If I gave you a chlorine
negative ion and said, what's

196
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,640
its conjugate base-- what's its
conjugate acid? you'd say

197
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
it's hydrochloric acid.

198
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,590
If I gave you hydrochloric acid
and I say, what's its

199
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,300
conjugate base, you get rid of
a hydrogen proton only, and

200
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,100
you're left with the chlorine
negative ion-- You said that

201
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,280
its conjugate base.

202
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,410
Now, with that said, we know
that when you put hydrochloric

203
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,190
acid, we know this reaction.

204
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,000
This was I think the first
reaction we looked at in

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,780
aqueous solution.

206
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:37,140
It disassociates completely to
form hydrogen protons plus

207
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,230
chlorine anions-- everything,
of course,

208
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,840
in an aqueous solution.

209
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,900
Now, the fact that it
disassociates completely, that

210
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,700
this is not an equilibrium
reaction, this implies that

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,170
this guy is more basic
than water.

212
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,630
He has no temptation-- no, no--
let me say that he is

213
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,230
less basic than water.

214
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,710
He has no temptation to grab
these hydrogen protons from

215
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,710
the surrounding medium to reform
hydrochloric acid.

216
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,150
This reaction does not
go in this direction.

217
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,990
So even though this chlorine
anion, or negative ion of

218
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:24,560
chlorine, is a "conjugate base of HCL", that

219
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,790
doesn't necessarily mean
it's that basic.

220
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,980
This is less basic than water.

221
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,140
It wants the hydrogen
protons less

222
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,180
than, let's say, hydronium.

223
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,890
So if you put some chlorine plus
some hydronium, or let's

224
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,880
say you have some H plus, you're
not going to reform

225
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,250
hydrochloric acid.

226
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,260
So this is not really basic even
though it's considered a

227
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,620
conjugate base.

228
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,760
And that's generally the case
whenever you're dealing with

229
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,920
strong acids, like in the case
of hydrochloric acid.

230
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,610
If I had a big solution of just
chlorine anions in water,

231
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,550
so I just had tons of a super
high concentration of chlorine

232
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,420
anions and water, because it's
not going to do anything to

233
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,550
change the actual hydrogen or
hydroxide concentration in the

234
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,510
water because it's less basic
than the water itself-- it

235
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,050
doesn't want to take or give
anything to the water-- the

236
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,380
PH, so if you have a soup,
the PH would be 7.

237
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,730
If you have chlorine minus in
an aqueous solution-- and I

238
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,440
don't care what its
concentration is, you could

239
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,480
have 10 molar of it-- the PH is
still going to be 7 because

240
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,700
it's not going to change
its solution.

241
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,640
It's not going to change the
PH, just this by itself.

242
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,970
Obviously, if you put
hydrochloric acid in an

243
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,400
aqueous solution this will
change it, because you're

244
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,390
going to be dumping all of these
hydrogen protons into

245
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,420
the solution.

246
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,310
So in general-- I mean, you can
kind of remember it, but I

247
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:05,080
think it's maybe common sense--
a strong acid's

248
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,940
conjugate base is neutral
in water.

249
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,160
Neutral.

250
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
So that means no impact on PH.

251
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,400
You say chlorine plus H2O, I
mean, you're essentially still

252
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,520
going to have chlorine
plus H2O.

253
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,760
You're not really changing
the concentration.

254
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,480
Now, on the other hand, when
you're dealing with weak

255
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,960
acids, so this reaction will
go in the other direction.

256
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,690
If you put some fluorine in
water, it will grab some

257
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,710
hydrogen-- not necessarily a
ton of it, but it will grab

258
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,910
some hydrogen from the
surrounding water-- and

259
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,470
increase the hydroxide
concentration.

260
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,500
It's increasing the
concentration of this thing

261
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,220
right here.

262
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,990
So it is making, in this
case, it is making the

263
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,130
solution more basic.

264
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,030
It's increasing the PH
of the solution.

265
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:18,610
So whenever you have a weak acid
its conjugate base will

266
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,860
be a weak base.

267
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,430
And you could make
this statement

268
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,560
the other way around.

269
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,950
If you have a conjugate-- let
me switch colors, this is

270
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:36,710
getting annoying-- conjugate
base-- sorry, a weak base, its

271
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,560
conjugate acid is going
to be a weak acid.

272
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,450
So hopefully you get
the idea here.

273
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,650
It's actually not that
fancy of an idea.

274
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,860
It's just that if you have an
acid, its conjugate base is

275
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,535
just that acid minus
a hydrogen.

276
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,220
If you have a base, its
conjugate acid is just that

277
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,410
thing plus a hydrogen.

278
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:05,440
Actually, let me just do a bunch
of problems here just to

279
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,640
really hit the point home of
what we're talking about.

280
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,810
Let's just do a bunch of them.

281
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:19,940
So if this is the acid and this
is its conjugate base, so

282
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,010
if I have-- I mean, you don't
even have to know the words.

283
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,130
If I have that, the conjugate
base, well, I'm just going to

284
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,270
get rid of a hydrogen proton.

285
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,300
So NO3 minus.

286
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,620
I didn't get rid of the whole
neutral hydrogen molecule.

287
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,950
Remember, I just took a proton
away, the electrons stay the

288
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,360
same, so I have a
negative charge.

289
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,460
Let's say we did H2SO4.

290
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,890
So its conjugate base, get
rid of a hydrogen.

291
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,760
HSO4 minus.

292
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,440
If I have hydrogen bromide,
get rid of a hydrogen.

293
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,420
It's BR minus.

294
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,150
And this is a strong acid.

295
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,010
So this is going to be a
neutral-- if you put this in

296
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,440
water, it's really not going to
do anything even though you

297
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
are calling it hydrogen
bromide's conjugate base.

298
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,460
Now, if we go the other way.

299
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,420
If we give you the base, if I
give you OH minus, what's its

300
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,570
conjugate acid?

301
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,320
Well, you add a proton
to it, you get H2O.

302
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,090
If I have H2O-- we already did
that-- you add a proton to it,

303
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,410
you get H3O plus.

304
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,540
If you have-- I mean, we
could just keep going.

305
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,880
Let's say I have that.

306
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,090
If I add a hydrogen
to it, I have H2.

307
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,640
There you go.

308
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,550
And it's neutral now because
I added a proton.

309
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,640
Anyway, hopefully I haven't
beaten this horse to death and

310
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,520
you understand what conjugate
acid and bases are all about.

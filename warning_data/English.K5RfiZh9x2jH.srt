1
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,799
Are you okay?

2
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:20,899
Yeah.

3
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,566
Even if you weren't okay, you're not the type who would tell me.

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,276
I'm really okay.

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,418
Wait just a little.

6
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:30,795
This time, honestly,

7
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:34,504
even if I have to leave my home,

8
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:37,221
I'm going to protect you.

9
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:39,885
What are you saying?

10
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:42,055
The Witch's

11
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:44,006
personality isn't the kind to sit back and do nothing.

12
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:48,662
She's definitely up to something.

13
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:50,822
I'm just saying that I'll be preparing, too.

14
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:53,251
Don't do that.

15
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:54,088
what?

16
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:57,531
Whatever you do, you have to be the reason for it.

17
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,285
I don't want you protecting me.

18
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,436
Why do you not like it?

19
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:07,068
Because you're my girl, it's a given that I'd protect you.

20
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:10,736
Someone protecting someone else; someone guarding over someone else...

21
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:14,889
If it's only sustainable by that... I don't like it.

22
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:22,883
Until now, I've already received so much from you, F4 sunbaes, even JaeKyung unnie.

23
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,045
At the very least, I want for you and I to be on equal footing.

24
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:30,025
As I overcome what needs to be overcome.

25
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,843
Do you know?

26
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,315
What?

27
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:36,323
You're the type of girl on whom

28
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:48,296
"cuteness" is wasted.

29
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,416
Huh, what's wrong with you?

30
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,175
Chan! (the boy's name) What's wrong?

31
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:56,611
Why are you so sad? What's wrong?

32
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,065
What?!

33
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:01,492
Is this the time to be laughing?

34
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:20,666
Hold it in. You'd better hold it in!

35
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,173
Chan, what is that?

36
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:24,218
Can you see that?

37
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:28,555
You can't see it well, huh?

38
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,409
Let me ride on your shoulders, okay?

39
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,167
what?

40
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,823
A shoulder ride.

41
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:38,899
Is it fun? Yeah.

42
00:02:38,899 --> 00:03:01,129
He's going to fall. <BR>No, I'm not going to fall.

43
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,533
It must be spring . . .

44
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,145
the weather's mellowed.

45
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,138
It's weird.

46
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:09,055
What is?

47
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,918
I feel as though

48
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:14,739
I'm in a vague dream

49
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:21,015
that I've had before.

50
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:23,085
I'm just saying...

51
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:33,583
How come this small kid's so heavy!

52
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,183
Hey, Manager Jung.

53
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,916
Young master, I think you'd better come back now.

54
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:58,916
Madam Chairman will find you.

55
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:55,725
Chan... Oops...

56
00:04:55,725 --> 00:05:09,518
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to YiJung! Happy birthday to you!

57
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,443
Happy birthday, YiJung.

58
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:37,756
Come on, you should make a wish and blow out the candles.

59
00:05:37,756 --> 00:06:00,927
This is a gift.

60
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,659
"One meeting, one opportunity "

61
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,095
What does it mean?

62
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:22,503
A once-in-a-lifetime fate.

63
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:26,383
GaEul.

64
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:28,782
YiJung sunbae...

65
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:31,386
I found it.

66
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:32,774
What?

67
00:06:32,774 --> 00:07:22,847
I finally found it.

68
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:33,684
*I love you, YiJung*

69
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:36,117
On that day

70
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:40,524
sunrise was at 7:00 am.

71
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:47,631
This was only visible right at sunrise, for just a few seconds.

72
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:59,314
That message.

73
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:02,713
Idiot.

74
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:06,393
Even knowing I was an idiot . . .

75
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,214
She knew it better than anyone in the whole world.

76
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:28,858
How could she give me such a tough problem to solve?

77
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,173
YiJung.

78
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:37,426
I really would like for you to show up.

79
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:40,045
The breeze...

80
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:46,039
can't go back to a place it has already left, YiJung.

81
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,292
Do it over! Do it over!

82
00:08:49,292 --> 00:09:19,719
Let me redo it!

83
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:24,734
Yesterday, the lovely spring weather

84
00:09:24,734 --> 00:10:22,552
brought out many families to the city zoo, where flowers were in full bloom.

85
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:25,088
Mr. President.

86
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:27,657
Are you serious about keeping this buried?

87
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:32,829
Even if they say it was an accident that a zealot committed?

88
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,967
It's not as though it would bring these two back to life.

89
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:40,237
I can't let JiHoo see his father and mother's death

90
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:43,607
be used in political strife.

91
00:10:43,607 --> 00:11:01,004
President.

92
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:08,832
I had no fear about something that I always believed was right.

93
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:19,109
But it wasn't until after I lost them that I realized that that was also a form of arrogance. . .

94
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:24,881
It was because of the fear that I might also lose you...

95
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:31,888
The years that I was unable to see you was my punishment.

96
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:40,797
When you should have been blaming your Grandfather, you had been living with that terrible burden.

97
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,006
Now, even if I die,

98
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:48,371
I have no regrets, child.

99
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:52,409
Can I ask that you take care of

100
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:57,008
the Foundation and the clinic?

101
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:08,358
It was your father and mother's wish to cure the heart by the arts and to cure illness by medical practice

102
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:14,598
Grandfather, I'm not yet...

103
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:16,833
Come over here!

104
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:21,871
Spicy fish soup is ready!

105
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:27,017
He he, that kid sure has a loud voice.

106
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:36,119
You're going to chase away all the fish with that loud voice of yours!

107
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,052
Is it all done?

108
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:47,003
Yes.

109
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,565
How is it?

110
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:55,137
You rascal, know that I'll eat it because I don't want to waste the perfectly good fish.

111
00:12:55,137 --> 00:13:06,483
JiHoo, why don't you taste it?

112
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:16,926
Amazingly, it tastes a lot like your mom's.

113
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:19,963
Ok, you two, look over here!

114
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:47,524
one...two...three!

115
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:51,394
I have good news and bad news.

116
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:56,767
Which one do you want to hear first?

117
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:00,904
Ah, I know your style.

118
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:06,309
Bad news first?

119
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,144
I probably will not

120
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:15,051
be as good as before.

121
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:17,921
This hand...

122
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,623
whether the pottery gods will choose it again,

123
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:21,925
I don't know.

124
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:27,664
No, they will.

125
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:32,902
But, what's the good news?

126
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:37,674
Even with all that, the fact that I will continue.

127
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:40,543
I'm not going to avoid it anymore.

128
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:44,948
If you give up once, how much you regret it...

129
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,218
I learned thanks to you.

130
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:51,454
Sunbae.

131
00:14:51,454 --> 00:15:05,791
GaEul, you want to try it?

132
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:12,019
How did you know that I would listen bad news first?

133
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:32,251
Because good girls like happy endings.

134
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:39,635
I definitely am a cool guy, but not a good guy.

135
00:15:39,635 --> 00:16:03,589
You need to get rid of your misconception that good girls want good guys.

136
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,914
Yes, mom.

137
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:08,187
What?

138
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:10,721
Is that true?

139
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,583
All right.

140
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:29,045
I'll be there right away.

141
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:34,283
We worked really hard, through the foundation,

142
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:39,795
and the hard efforts of a lot of people went into this.

143
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:43,147
Jandi, take a walk around.

144
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:49,382
Okay.

145
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:51,224
It's quite something, isn't it?

146
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:52,099
It's so spacious.

147
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,432
Oh! What's that grandpa?

148
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:58,362
Over there are all meeting rooms.

149
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:01,346
Hold on a second.

150
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:04,546
Yes, it's me.

151
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:07,755
Hey, is that true?

152
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,511
Who would have the nerve?

153
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:14,945
How on earth did this situation come about?

154
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:16,471
No!

155
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:22,305
Whatever happens, we must take care of the foundation!

156
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,604
No!

157
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:28,726
Grandpa! Grandpa!

158
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,828
Grandpa! Grandpa!

159
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:41,472
Grandpa, your medicine! The medicine!

160
00:17:41,472 --> 00:18:35,826
Sunbae! The hospital, the hospital!

161
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:40,663
He did not want you to know.

162
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:47,795
He said he'd be fine as long as he's careful.

163
00:18:47,795 --> 00:19:15,399
Let's go and get Grandfather's stuff.

164
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,515
The preparations are going well, I presume

165
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:21,258
Chairwoman,

166
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:22,706
Apart from anything else,

167
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:26,243
could you reconsider about the Sooam Foundation?

168
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:29,179
You know better than anyone that

169
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:34,017
I'm not doing this out of greed for the silly foundation.

170
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:37,741
What are you intending to do?

171
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,118
At this chance, I'm going to pull it out the roots.

172
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:54,877
It's so fortunate that that little upstart child values something more than money.

173
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,074
I have a proposition.

174
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,042
A proposition?

175
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:01,111
The fact that the marriage didn't happen...

176
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:03,947
I'm sorry about that.

177
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,049
But...

178
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:10,032
it's not like the ties are completely cut with JK Group.

179
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:13,123
I will do my utmost to save it.

180
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:16,527
Trust in me.

181
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:17,694
And so what?

182
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:22,199
Whether you put spies on me or keep me locked up.

183
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,501
I'll take whatever you dish out.

184
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,537
Except.

185
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:28,372
Except...

186
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:31,041
leave Jandi

187
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:35,445
alone.

188
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:39,883
If I don't do anything to Geum Jandi, then is that enough?

189
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:42,152
Yeah.

190
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:44,421
I'll make that promise.

191
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:48,926
I won't lift a finger against Geum Jandi.

192
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,727
In return

193
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,931
don't forget what you've said just now.

194
00:20:53,931 --> 00:21:34,571
Don't worry.

195
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:39,071
This is not the time to be mopping around.

196
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:47,451
Granny?

197
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:52,122
Do you still not know your mother?

198
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:55,067
This is not the time for you to feel at ease.

199
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,095
When you can't even take care of your own girl,

200
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:04,501
how do you plan on taking care of ShinHwa Group in the future?

201
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:09,039
I did not raise you to be such a pathetic person.

202
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,144
Just because a person is born as a male doesn't mean you're automatically a man.

203
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,781
Since you're furious at your defeat, you can't bear to step back,

204
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:21,218
and you're embarrassed about running away,

205
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:27,157
you overcome your weak character over time.

206
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:32,729
That's how you become a real man.

207
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:41,138
Do you understand?

208
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:46,051
Granny!

209
00:22:46,051 --> 00:24:32,649
Thank you.

210
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:39,189
*JiHoo in Kindergarten*

211
00:24:39,189 --> 00:25:03,246
* JiHoo in elementary school *

212
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:46,189
JiHoo in college.

213
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:49,793
Gaeul

214
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:53,797
Didn't you say your father had tenure of 20 years at his company?

215
00:25:53,797 --> 00:26:00,018
It hasn't even been that long since he was promoted to assistant manager.

216
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:08,905
How come they suddenly force only your dad to resign?

217
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:26,694
Why did they do it?

218
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:28,183
Seriously?

219
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:34,688
Shinhwa's Group subcontracting company forced GaEul's dad to resign, all of those things in just one morning?

220
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,635
Looks like it.

221
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:41,406
I was wondering why she didn't do anything after the wedding.

222
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:45,137
Then again it seems Jihoo has been put into a mess too.

223
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,756
JiHoo's?

224
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:50,387
It seems Chairman Kang is going to take over Jihoo's foundation as well.

225
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,176
What?

226
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,177
The development of the new art center in Song-do has already been postponed.

227
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:57,222
Then...

228
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:59,739
This is all?

229
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:23,081
Her plan to destroy, the one, Geum JanDi.

230
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:27,951
Grandfather...

231
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:29,937
JanDi, glad you came.

232
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:30,956
Why?

233
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:33,933
Did you miss me in that short period of time?

234
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,911
You and your delusional thinking!

235
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:41,169
JanDi, since you're here, why don't you take that boy out of here?

236
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:45,767
He's completely stuck on me and won't move an inch.

237
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:52,454
It's suffocating.

238
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:55,313
Why aren't you guys both getting out of here?

239
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:58,684
On such a beautiful spring day!

240
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:02,654
You young, pathetic things,

241
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:12,964
Get out of here now!

242
00:28:12,964 --> 00:29:27,566
Let's get out of here.

243
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,776
<i>The development of the new art center has already been postponed.</i>

244
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:33,178
<i>So, this is . . .</i>

245
00:29:33,178 --> 00:30:00,605
<i>Her plan to destroy the one, Geum JanDi.</i>

246
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,008
The desire to protect someone,

247
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,429
I never thought it would develop in me.

248
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:10,715
But since I met you,

249
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:14,519
I started developing it.

250
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,824
Grandfather, the clinic,

251
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:21,033
the foundation,

252
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:24,998
And...

253
00:30:24,998 --> 00:31:09,622
you.

254
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:16,105
<i>Now since Grandpa is with Sunbae, I'm really relieved.

255
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:26,198
<i>Sunbae, you don't know that, right?But sunbae, you were always like sunshine to me.

256
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:49,887
<i> Goodbye, my fireman.

257
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:52,859
A dandelion lives as a dandelion,

258
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,038
while a horseweed lives as a horseweed.

259
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,888
A plantain also lives as a plantain.

260
00:31:57,888 --> 00:32:03,495
On the harsh grounds, though the plantain that lives on the side of the road can only grow angulated,

261
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:09,151
In the rich soil, it shows a different side and is dignified in its own way.

262
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:17,509
This way, and that way, it does not forget its shape and lives as a perfect plantain.

263
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:19,674
That's where I learned it.

264
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:33,892
That I too, must live as myself.

265
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:37,662
Mister,

266
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:42,233
I don't think I can come here anymore.

267
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:47,305
I wanted to see you get better.

268
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:53,244
There were a lot of books I wanted to read to you.

269
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:56,848
I apologize.

270
00:32:56,848 --> 00:33:00,752
I...

271
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:05,061
can endure hunger.

272
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:09,694
And even being cold, I can endure.

273
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:14,499
But there is one thing...

274
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:19,304
that I can never endure.

275
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:25,343
It's seeing those that I love endure hardship because of me.

276
00:33:25,343 --> 00:33:34,953
It's not something that I can make better by trying harder.

277
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:39,958
Don't you think it's a little unfair this time?

278
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:44,963
Mister, I'm not running away.

279
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:47,799
Mister, you know that, right?

280
00:33:47,799 --> 00:34:28,205
Even when I'm not here, you have to get better.

281
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,676
Chairwoman,

282
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:34,779
Geum JanDi is here.

283
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,314
She came here quicker than I expected.

284
00:34:36,314 --> 00:35:11,916
Let her in.

285
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,785
Hello, Miss.

286
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:15,353
Oh, Jandi! Hi!

287
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:17,288
Has everyone been doing well?

288
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:21,493
But what's going on? Is it okay for you to be here?

289
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:24,729
It's OK. They won't kill me or bite me!

290
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:26,698
Geum JanDi! Fighting!

291
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:32,077
We're all on your side!

292
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:38,042
Hello Sunbae nim.

293
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:42,213
Welcome, Miss Geum JanDi.

294
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,249
Why are you acting like that?

295
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:46,918
It's me, Geum JanDi, your apprentice.

296
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:50,355
You're a guest when you come to this house now.

297
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:53,358
But, what brings you here?

298
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,726
Ah..Goo JunPyo....

299
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:59,043
I mean Master JunPyo....

300
00:35:59,043 --> 00:36:02,033
I came to see Goo JoonPyo.

301
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,469
Young Master is in his room.

302
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:12,061
Okay...

303
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:17,348
JunPyo, let's play!

304
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:19,084
Goo JunPyo, let's play!

305
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:32,033
Now I'm even hearing Geum JanDi's voice.

306
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:35,099
Hey, what's going on?

307
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:42,024
Goo JoonPyo, let's play.

308
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:45,777
Why are you here?

309
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:47,545
Did that Witch do something again?

310
00:36:47,545 --> 00:36:48,364
Is that it?

311
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:52,009
Let's play, Goo JoonPyo!

312
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,297
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

313
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,697
Goo JoonPyo, let's go on a picnic.

314
00:36:57,697 --> 00:37:00,097
What?

315
00:37:00,097 --> 00:38:35,571
Picnic!

316
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,654
Is today a special day

317
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:40,122
What?

318
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:48,454
I don't know well but isn't this what it feels like to have a birthday party or to win the lottery?

319
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:50,283
Are you that happy?

320
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:51,559
Yeah.

321
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:55,138
I wish everyday was like today.

322
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:58,664
Just think about it. You asked me out on a date.

323
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:02,583
And we haven't even fought once.

324
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,534
You're right.

325
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:10,009
While we're on the subject, can I ask you for one more favor?

326
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:15,414
What is it?

327
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:21,453
Why haven't you told me that you like me?

328
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:25,004
I've told you, many times

329
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:28,209
Do I really have to say it in words

330
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,086
I want to hear it.

331
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:40,902
What kind of person am I to you?

332
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:44,823
I like you.

333
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:49,812
No matter how much I've tried not to like you...

334
00:39:49,812 --> 00:40:57,049
Even though I've tried to erase the feeling, I can't. It's to the point where I'm just frustrated.

335
00:40:57,049 --> 00:41:01,052
Didn't you come because you had something to say?

336
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:04,039
Leave them alone.

337
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:04,099
What

338
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,096
My friend GaEul's family

339
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:11,261
And JiHoo Sunbae's Foundation

340
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,431
Just leave it be

341
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,311
What's your offer?

342
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:18,289
What are you going to give me in return?

343
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:23,142
If there's nothing as collateral, I don't have any desire to agree.

344
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:28,745
I'll leave.

345
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:32,637
I'll leave Goo JoonPyo.

346
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:36,822
I'll transfer schools and move.

347
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:39,892
I'll move to a place Goo JoonPyo can never find me.

348
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:44,729
Is that enough?

349
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:47,366
If only you keep that promise..

350
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:51,346
I'll keep that promise.

351
00:41:51,346 --> 00:41:52,905
Fine.

352
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:55,274
I think we've come to an agreement.

353
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:57,428
I'm not losing to you.

354
00:41:57,428 --> 00:42:00,372
i'm not running away or stealing either.

355
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:03,301
You are...

356
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:11,324
The most evil person I've ever known.

357
00:42:11,324 --> 00:42:15,228
The people that I love....

358
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:18,564
I don't want them entangled with you. so I'm leaving.

359
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:23,603
From you,

360
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:28,608
...the person I love the most

361
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:48,628
I can't save, and it makes me feel so anxious

362
00:42:48,628 --> 00:42:50,462
Goo JoonPyo

363
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:53,866
Hmm?

364
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,235
Stop the car here.

365
00:42:56,235 --> 00:42:57,057
Here?

366
00:42:57,057 --> 00:43:00,439
Why?

367
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:30,742
Just stop the car.

368
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,837
What's up with these bags?

369
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:38,601
Is this a surprise event?

370
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:43,363
Goo JoonPyo,

371
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:46,424
I'm not going to see you anymore.

372
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:47,847
What

373
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:50,125
Today was my last day with you

374
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,905
Hey, Geum JanD

375
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:55,041
Are you bothered that we didn't fight once today?

376
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,387
Even if you're going to joke around, what kind of a joke is this?

377
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:01,318
I'm not joking.

378
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:03,421
What's your reason?

379
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:05,341
Did the witch do something to you again?

380
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:09,089
No, it was my decision.

381
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:11,829
to take you out of my life.

382
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,152
Geum jandi

383
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:14,941
Thank you for everything.

384
00:44:14,941 --> 00:44:16,007
Take care.

385
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:19,042
What's wrong with you?

386
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,902
You said you liked me.

387
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:27,868
Just a while ago, you said it yourself that you liked me so why...!

388
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:30,021
It's because of the witch, isn't it?

389
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,021
Right?

390
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:33,346
no

391
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,081
It's because of me.

392
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:36,278
What?

393
00:44:36,278 --> 00:44:39,047
This time, I realized

394
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:45,273
that you and I live in two separate worlds.

395
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:48,522
Even though we met in a dream-like fate, but

396
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:50,659
now

397
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:53,803
it's time to return to our separate worlds.

398
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:56,415
That's a lie.

399
00:44:56,415 --> 00:45:00,511
You're lying to me right now.

400
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,826
Tell me.

401
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:03,061
I'll solve it.

402
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:19,927
I'll protect you!

403
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:33,504
DON'T LEAVE

404
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:37,277
You said you liked me

405
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,613
Your love is like this

406
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:43,000
You said that you liked me and you're going to end it so easily?

407
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,544
Maybe it was just this much.

408
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:54,023
No matter how much I liked you, maybe this is all I could put up with.

409
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:56,531
just this much

410
00:45:56,531 --> 00:45:58,083
maybe it was just thatt

411
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:01,168
Say it.

412
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:05,726
Aside from ShinHwa and being a plutocrat,

413
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:08,547
have you ever seen me

414
00:46:08,547 --> 00:46:13,489
as just a guy?

415
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:16,811
No.

416
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:21,648
No matter how much you struggle, you're still ShinHwa Group's Goo JoonPyo.

417
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:50,396
I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.

418
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:51,893
Pull Over!

419
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,111
JanDi!

420
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,388
Geum JanDi!

421
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:58,702
JanDi!

422
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:01,445
I said pull over!

423
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:14,528
JanDi!

424
00:47:14,528 --> 00:47:18,076
JanDi !

425
00:47:18,076 --> 00:47:23,302
Ever since I've liked you, I've always wished for it...

426
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:31,542
that you were a normal guy that had nothing to do with ShinHwa or being a plutocrat.

427
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:33,089
Sorry GooJunPyo

428
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:35,996
For not being able to keep our promise.

429
00:47:35,996 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm really sorry

430
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,333
JanDi!

431
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:50,103
Grandfather is here. Where is she?

432
00:48:50,103 --> 00:49:06,042
Jandi? This child!

433
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:09,022
I'm sorry that I have to leave this way.

434
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:12,154
Thank you for everything.

435
00:49:12,154 --> 00:49:14,227
I'll never forget how grateful I am.

436
00:49:14,227 --> 00:50:24,443
Both of you, please take care.

437
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:27,587
I'm telling the truth.

438
00:50:27,587 --> 00:50:29,703
Why won't you believe me?

439
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:31,638
Oh, you're starting again!

440
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:35,127
If your future son-in-law is some heir to great fortune, what are you doing here?

441
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:38,444
And not just any heir, ShinHwa Group?!

442
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:42,715
Then my future daughter-in-law is Jun Sul Group's daughter!

443
00:50:42,715 --> 00:50:45,184
My daughter goes to ShinHwa High School.

444
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:48,888
I've even made dinner for ShinHwa Group's heir, Goo JoonPyo.

445
00:50:48,888 --> 00:50:51,401
Why won't you believe a word I say?

446
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:52,558
Fine, all right.

447
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:57,964
Then why don't you go to your future son-in-law and have him take care of your debts?

448
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:05,429
If you don't, something might happen to you

449
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,884
Oh, welcome. What can I get you

450
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:14,981
Give me one of these

451
00:51:14,981 --> 00:51:26,236
Here you go.

452
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:27,056
Who is that?

453
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:30,964
He came here in kind of the same situation as you.

454
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:33,366
He was the president of a startup company...

455
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:36,436
M, M . . .

456
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:42,008
However, he lost everything because of some large corporations.

457
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:47,046
He was divorced and lost his kids, too.

458
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:48,181
Oh, no. What to do?

459
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:55,488
Seeing that he's been hanging around here for the past few months, I think he's hiding from creditors.

460
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:56,079
That's really too bad.

461
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,793
You've got problems of your own. You're in no position to worry about others!

462
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:40,933
Yeah, that's right.

463
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:45,371
Isn't that JanDi?

464
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,306
Oh, my. Oh, my! JanDi!

465
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:53,179
Mom!

466
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:57,016
What brought you here? I wanted to see you.

467
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,518
Is this the daughter that you've been talking about?

468
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:01,721
Yes, yes. This is her!

469
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,923
Watch this. See this?

470
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:07,894
See? This is ShinHwa High School uniform!

471
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:10,963
Oh, my, you said she went to ShinHwa High. She really does go there!

472
00:53:10,963 --> 00:53:14,367
JanDi, come on. Let's go talk!

473
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,836
Why don't you all watch over my little store?

474
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:19,639
Okay, okay, don't worry.

475
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,443
Oh, what kind of luck is that!

476
00:53:23,443 --> 00:53:25,311
Watch it carefully!

477
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:28,948
How and what brought you here, JanDi?

478
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:31,784
She looks like she's grown well.

479
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:32,885
What?

480
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:34,854
Dad's on a boat?

481
00:53:34,854 --> 00:53:36,656
What were we supposed to do?

482
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:38,925
Our debt kept growing.

483
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:40,961
We have to send your brother, KangSan, to school.

484
00:53:40,961 --> 00:53:43,363
It seems like we can't even support the three of us.

485
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:45,065
Why didn't you tell me then?

486
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:47,266
What good would it have done except to make you worry?

487
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,604
I could have quit school, gotten a job. I could have done something.

488
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:53,172
And that's why I didn't say anything

489
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:56,442
You need to graduate from ShinHwa High and go to ShinHwa University.

490
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:01,848
Get married to Master JoonPyo or someone so we can survive.

491
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:03,983
That's our hope.

492
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:05,418
Mom...

493
00:54:05,418 --> 00:54:08,221
That's rubbish.

494
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:14,006
Wait, you....why aren't you going to school and why'd you suddenly come here?

495
00:54:14,006 --> 00:54:15,971
I came because I missed you guys.

496
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:23,172
Mom, dad, San.

497
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:29,476
Honey! Our daughter, JanDi, came.

498
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:37,391
You're doing well, right

499
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:40,387
daddy!

500
00:54:40,387 --> 00:54:44,836
I came. You're healthy, right?

501
00:54:44,836 --> 00:54:49,068
Please look after your health!

502
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:52,049
Dad!

503
00:54:52,049 --> 00:55:05,545
Dad!

504
00:55:05,545 --> 00:55:08,947
Have you heard any news about JanDi?

505
00:55:08,947 --> 00:55:10,122
Well....

506
00:55:10,122 --> 00:55:14,798
I've searched just about everywhere. It's harder to find her than I thought.

507
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:16,662
I wonder where she's hidden herself so well.

508
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:21,055
That JoonPyo, I don't think he's been so unreachable ever.

509
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:22,635
He wasn't even this bad in Macao.

510
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:23,824
I know...

511
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:28,016
It's as if he's sitting on a time bomb. It's hard to watch from above or below.

512
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:30,336
The weird thing is, JiHoo is the same way.

513
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:32,405
He's doing well with his grandfather.

514
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:38,544
Do you think Yoon JiHoo going to work everyday at the Foundation is normal?

515
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,347
For a guy who used to sleep all the time and mess around with his instruments to act like that is....

516
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:43,838
I think is more strange than how JoonPyo is, and it makes me quite worried.

517
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:45,014
That is true.

518
00:55:45,014 --> 00:55:47,269
How impressive Geum JanDi is!

519
00:55:47,269 --> 00:56:18,651
to put the great F4 into this state and then disappear.

520
00:56:18,651 --> 00:56:21,855
Yes, Grandfather. It's me.

521
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:23,087
Yes.

522
00:56:23,087 --> 00:57:06,565
I'll come get you right now

523
00:57:06,565 --> 00:57:11,461
Oh, what to do! Our JanDi has come to visit and the ban chan (side dishes) are lacking.

524
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,185
What about the ban chan?

525
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:17,678
Just the fact that I'm having a meal with you makes me so happy I can die!

526
00:57:17,678 --> 00:57:21,915
Noona, how many days will you be staying before you leave? It'll be nice if you could stay a long time.

527
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:23,425
I'll be staying a long time.

528
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:26,685
What do you mean you'll be staying long! You have to go to school

529
00:57:26,685 --> 00:57:30,556
Stop worrying about your family and accomplish what you need to do.

530
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:32,391
KangSan's mom?!

531
00:57:32,391 --> 00:57:38,631
I wonder who it is.

532
00:57:38,631 --> 00:57:41,634
We came.

533
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:42,868
What are you guys doing here?

534
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:49,339
Oh, she definitely is a future daughter-in-law material of a filthy rich family.

535
00:57:49,339 --> 00:57:54,929
Only the rich attend ShinHwa High, so you must have lots of friends who are rich!

536
00:57:54,929 --> 00:58:00,362
Who cares about the friends? She's dating the heir to ShinHwa Group!

537
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:06,825
Living in the country, I never dreamed that I'd come to know the in-laws of ShinHwa Group!

538
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:09,094
Oh, I know, I know.

539
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:11,013
Try this

540
00:58:11,013 --> 00:58:15,034
Oh, and the money that you borrowed, just take your time in paying that back.

541
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,454
Oh, really?

542
00:58:16,454 --> 00:58:18,544
Oh, yes. Of course.

543
00:58:18,544 --> 00:58:20,529
Oh, and take this.

544
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:22,875
Take this too.

545
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:31,015
Take it. Take it.

546
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:36,176
What's the occasion, this late at night?

547
00:58:36,176 --> 00:59:31,112
- Eat it. - Okay, we'll eat it well.

548
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:55,902
You got it! I got it!

549
00:59:55,902 --> 00:59:58,502
You said you liked me.

550
00:59:58,502 --> 01:00:01,127
Is this how your love is?

551
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:04,705
Can you really say you like me and end it this easily?

552
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:10,527
This must have been the limit.

553
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:14,136
No matter how much I liked you,

554
01:00:14,136 --> 01:00:19,057
The amount I could put up with

555
01:00:19,057 --> 01:00:33,571
Must've been only this much.

556
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:34,812
Hey, what are you doing?

557
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:36,475
Master, why are you doing this?

558
01:00:36,475 --> 01:00:38,377
Why are you breaking somebody else's machine?

559
01:00:38,377 --> 01:01:02,253
Don't touch me!

560
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:05,789
Why haven't you told me that you like me?

561
01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:08,989
Do I really have to say it in words?

562
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:11,005
I want to hear it.

563
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:21,053
What I am to you...

564
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:24,274
I like you.

565
01:01:24,274 --> 01:01:29,629
No matter how much I've tried not to like you,

566
01:01:29,629 --> 01:01:32,633
even though I've tried to erase the feeling,

567
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:53,452
I can't, to the point where I'm just frustrated.

568
01:01:53,452 --> 99:59:59,999
JoonPyo.

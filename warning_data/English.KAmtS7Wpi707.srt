1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410


2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,490
We're asked how many

3
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,410
centiliters are in one dekaliter?

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,710
So the first thing we want to
do is just think about how

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,270
much is a centiliter relative to
a liter, and how much is a

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,120
dekaliter relative to a liter?

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,710
And I'll write the
prefixes down.

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,173
And really, you should have
these memorized because you're

9
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,250
going to see these prefixes
over and over again for

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,880
different types of units.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,890
So the prefix, kilo, sometimes
[? ki-lo, ?]

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,260
this means 1,000.

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,670
If you see hecto,
hecto means 100.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,100
Deka means 10.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,220
If you have nothing, then
that just means 1.

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,670
Let's put that there.

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,940
Then if you have deci,
this means 1/10.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,810
If you have centi,
this means 1/100.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,570
If you have milli, this
means 1/1,000.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,220
So let's go back to what we
have. We have centiliters.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,819


22
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,640
Let me write this in
a different color.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:22,350
If you have a centiliter, this
is equal to 1/100 of a liter,

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,430
Or you could say 1 liter for
every 100 centiliters, so you

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,310
could also write it like this:
1 liter for every 100, or per

26
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:42,060
every 100, centiliters.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,940
So we got the centi, now let's
think about the dekaliter.

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,820
So the deka is right
over here.

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:54,880
So a dekaliter means
10 liters.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,300
Or another way to say it is for
every 10 liters, you will

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,930
have 1 dekaliter.

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,090
Now, before I actually
work out the problem,

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,240
what's going on here?

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,380
We're going from a smaller
unit to a larger unit, so

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,440
there are going to be many of
the smaller units in one of

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,380
the larger ones.

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,190
And we can do it
multiple ways.

38
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,740
So we want to essentially
convert 1 dekaliter into

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,600
centiliters.

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,590
Now, we could just do it by
looking at this chart, or we

41
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,930
could do it with the dimensional
analysis, making

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,020
sure the dimensions work out.

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,240
Let's do it the first way.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,680
So if you have one dekaliter,
how many liters is that?

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,540


46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,690
1 dekaliter over here would be
the same thing as 10 liters.

47
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,860
That's liters.

48
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,290
We're assuming that our
unit is liters here.

49
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,380
And then 10 liters is going
to be how many deciliters?

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,990
It's going to be 100
deciliters, right?

51
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,370
Because each of these is
10 deciliters, and

52
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,750
you have 10 of them.

53
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,790
So every time you go down,
you're going to be multiplying

54
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,510
by a factor of 10.

55
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,560
100 deciliters is how
many centiliters?

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, 100 deciliters, each of
them is going to be worth 10

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,650
centiliters, so that's going
to be 1,000 centiliters.

58
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,920
So we have our answer:
1 dekaliter is 1,000

59
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,170
centiliters.

60
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,600


61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,690
Now, the other way to do it is
you could convert a dekaliter

62
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,480
to liters, and then convert
a liter to centiliters.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,780
So if we have one dekaliter--
and whenever you do unit

64
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,550
things, just make sure
that it makes sense.

65
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,380
Sometimes, people, instead of
multiplying, they would

66
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,710
divide, and then they'd get,
oh, 1 dekaliter is equal to

67
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,440
1/1,000 of a centiliter.

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,300
And they say, no, no, no, no.

69
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,130
A dekaliter is a much larger
unit that a centiliter.

70
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,720
So 1 dekaliter has to be
a bunch of centiliters.

71
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,970
This should be a large number,
so you should always do that

72
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,020
reality check whenever you're
dealing with units.

73
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,540
Now, let's do it the dimensional
analysis way.

74
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,640
We're starting with
one dekaliter.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,250
We want to convert
it to liters.

76
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,800
So if you're converting it to
liters, you want the dekaliter

77
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,120
in the denominator and you want
liters in the numerator.

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,060
Now, how many liters
are 1 dekaliter?

79
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,620
Well, you could say 10 liters
is equal to 1 dekaliter.

80
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,950


81
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,300
So 1 dekaliter is equal
to-- these cancel out.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,270
1 times 10 is 10 liters.

83
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,570
Now, if we wanted to convert
this to centiliters, we're

84
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,850
going to want the liters in the
denominator, and you want

85
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,855
the centiliters in
the numerator.

86
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:41,230
Now,

87
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,900
how many centiliters are
there per liter?

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,135
How many centiliters?

89
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,020
Well, 1 liter is 100
centiliters.

90
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,790
Centiliter is 1/100
of a liter.

91
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,280
Notice, this and this are
the inverse statements.

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,540
They're saying same the
exact same thing.

93
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,760
1 liter per 100 centiliters.

94
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,370
Here, writing 1 liter
per 100 centiliters.

95
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,450
We've just flipped it, but
they're giving the same

96
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,400
information.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
And the reason why we flipped
it is so that the liters

98
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,860
cancel out, and then we're just
left with 10 times 100 is

99
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,880
1,000 centiliters.

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,850
And we are done!

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,850
We're asked to write this right
here in word form, and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,110
I'm not saying it out loud
because that would give the

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,720
answer away.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,370
We have 63.15 that we want
to write in word form.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,580
Well, the stuff to the left of
the decimal point is pretty

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,320
straightforward.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,550
Let me actually color code it.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,440
So we have 6, 3.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,220
Let me do it all in
different colors.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:31,410
And then we have a decimal, and
then we have a 1 and a 5.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,880

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,120
There's one common way of doing
this, but we'll talk

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,040
about the different ways you
could express this as a word.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,320
But we know how to write
this stuff to the left.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,470
This is pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,950
This is just sixty-three.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,060
Let me write that down.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,850
So this is sixty-three.

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,890

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,173
And instead of the decimal,
we'll write, and.

22
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,750

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,290
Now there's two ways
to go here.

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:13,110
We could say, and one tenth
and five hundredths, or we

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,240
could just say, look, this
is fifteen hundredths.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,540
One tenth is ten hundredths.

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,160
So one tenth and five hundredths
is fifteen

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,180
hundredths.

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:32,790
So maybe I can write it like
this: sixty-three and fifteen

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,040
hundredths.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,490

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,410
Just like that.

33
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,830
Now, it might have been a little
bit more natural to

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,350
say, how come I don't say
one tenth and then five

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,680
hundredths?

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,280
And you could, but that would
just make it a little bit

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,360
harder for someone's brain to
process it when you say it.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,620
So it could have been
sixty-three-- so let me copy

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,870
and paste that.

40
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,780

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,490
It could be sixty-three and, and
then you would write, one

42
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:14,060
tenth for this digit right
there, and five hundredths.

43
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:26,170

44
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,570
Sixty-three and one tenth and
five hundredths is hard for

45
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,010
most people's brains
to process.

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,710
But if you say, fifteen
hundredths, people get what

47
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,780
you're saying.

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,300
Not to beat a dead horse, but
this right here, this is 1/10

49
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:47,730
right here and then this
is 5/100, 5 over 100.

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,050
But if you were to add these
two, If you were to add 1/10

51
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,120
plus 5/100 -- so
let's do that.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,770
If you were to add 1/10 plus
5/100, how would you do it?

53
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,060
You need a common denominator.

54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,740
100 is divisible by both 10 and
100, so multiply both the

55
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,820
numerator and denominator
of this character by 10.

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,130
You get 10 on the top and
100 on the bottom.

57
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,990
1/10 is the same thing
as 10 over 100.

58
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,930
10/100 plus 5/100 is equal to
15 over 100, so this piece

59
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,030
right here is equal to 15/100.

60
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,420
And that's why we say
sixty-three and fifteen

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,670
hundredths.

62
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,134

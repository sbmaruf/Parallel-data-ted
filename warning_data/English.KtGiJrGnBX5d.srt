1
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:05,466
Voiceover: Ok so now you see
how cool a short program can be

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,570
so hopefully you're really excited to keep
going with programming and Khan Academy

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,100
and we want to give you a little
tour of what you can expect.

4
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:16,276
When we want to teach new concepts
we use coding talk throughs

5
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,442
where we'll write code on
the left side over here

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,859
and we'll see the result on
the right side constantly

7
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,776
updating as we change the code.

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,773
We'll also be talking
about what we're writing

9
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:28,573
so make sure you have your
headphones or speakers on.

10
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:32,216
To get started with a
talkthrough, just click play.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,190
And pause if you want to study
something that we've done.

12
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,941
You can even change the code yourself
then and see the result update.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,140
Like maybe, I think that
Winston is actually an alien

14
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:46,686
from this crazy planet
with purple faces and

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,970
I just think that he should
have really, really big eyes.

16
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,139
Whoah! bug eyes!

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,400
Programming isn't just about going through
the tutorials that we've given you.

18
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,853
Our favorite part about
programming is the exploration and

19
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:01,186
the creativity of it.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,770
That means that when you wake
up in the middle of the night

21
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,522
with an idea for a completely new program,

22
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:09,443
just log on and click new program.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,470
Once you've done that,
you'll get a blank editor and

24
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:14,855
a blank canvas and the world will
be your programmatic playground.

25
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,755
So you might not remember
how to do things,

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,630
you can look down at the
documentation and remember

27
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:23,683
oh yeah, i want the ellipse
function and then I'm going to

28
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:28,185
use the draw function, OK,
alright so we go up here and we

29
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:34,154
use some variables there.

30
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,568
And then we hope it runs.

31
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,598
Oh! But we got a problem, uh-oh.

32
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,393
mouseZ is not defined. OK, that's fine.

33
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,421
It's actually supposed to be mouseY.

34
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:46,485
And now it works. So here's the point

35
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,455
It's totally OK to make mistakes.

36
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,259
You should make mistakes.

37
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:52,088
That's what we programmers
do, all the time.

38
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:55,952
We just break things and make
mistakes, and then we learn from them.

39
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:59,187
Now once I've made my
amazing new program and

40
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:05,761
I'm really satisfied with it, I can save
it, give it a really nice descriptive name

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,859
like "Circle Drawy ThingyBobby".

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,670
Maybe, "Mr Circle Drawy Thingerbobby",
I can save that and then

43
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:17,292
other people can actually find it.

44
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,219
But creativity isn't just about
creating completely new things,

45
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,733
it's just as much about building
on top of existing things and
taking them in new directions.

46
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,407
That's the power of the spin off.

47
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:31,653
So now that I've saved this program,
I can actually go and modify it.

48
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:36,404
And if I consider my new
program to be different, I
can just go "save as spin-off"

49
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:43,824
Alright so this one's like "Mr
Big Circle Drawer ThingyBobby"

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,400
But you don't just have to
spin off your own programs

51
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:50,193
you can spin off anyone's programs.

52
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,859
We've made it really easy for you
to find other people's programs.

53
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:56,736
You can browse the hot, the
spotlight, the top, the recent.

54
00:02:56,735 --> 00:03:00,195
I mean, I spend my Friday nights just
browsing programs on Khan Academy

55
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,990
because I find so many cool things
that I would have never thought of.

56
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:07,236
So some people make games, right.

57
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,906
Like Doodle-Jump. If you've ever
played that on the mobile phone.

58
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:11,484
It's a really fun game.

59
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:18,486
And somebody made this version on
here and oh-man, almost got it, ahh!

60
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,989
Alright, I'll play that again later.

61
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:25,634
People make simulations, so if you want
to understand how a pendulum works,

62
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:30,785
like if you're in physics class,
you can do it in a much more fun
way by using this simulation here.

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,830
And then you can go and modify
things on the side to see

64
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:37,164
how different variables
affect the pendulum.

65
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:40,398
People make drawings, like of
their favorite cartoon characters.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,850
This is my favorite,
the TARDIS from Dr. Who.

67
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,467
And if you're not watching Dr.
Who yet, you really should.

68
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:50,337
Because as you can see from all the
programs and spin-offs on Khan Acadamy

69
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:53,354
it's a really cool show.

70
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,999
People make charts or
even animated charts.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,430
Some people make really trippy
animations like this one.

72
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:04,021
I could just watch this for
hours and get hypnotized by it.

73
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:09,306
You can see that lots of other
people liked it too because they made
all these spin-offs of it, right.

74
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,711
Because that's the thing,

75
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:13,406
if you find a program that you like,
you can just start tinkering with it

76
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:17,513
and seeing "oh well what
if I change this, and this?

77
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:21,565
"and maybe I change this
here, how's it change it?"

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180
And you may not even
understand it entirely first,

79
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,461
but the more you tinker with it,
the more you play with the code,

80
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:28,515
you get a better feel for it and

81
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,904
maybe you come up with this variation
that you think is really cool,

82
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,850
and then you'll save it
as a spin-off and say like

83
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:38,676
"Alright this is my really
cool version of the Hypnozaic"

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,370
And then you can save it and
other people can find it.

85
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,066
But maybe you want to ask
a question about it. Right.

86
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,615
Maybe you don't understand
how something works.

87
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,787
We'll just go to the questions panel

88
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:57,226
and say like "why did you
start your variables with i?"

89
00:04:57,227 --> 00:05:00,867
"Do you work for Apple?"

90
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,497
And you can ask your
question and hopefully

91
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:04,872
the person who created it will answer it.

92
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:09,118
If you find a question that
you know the answer to,

93
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:13,997
then answer them, and say
like "hey, yeah you can,

94
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:16,282
"here's where I did it"

95
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:19,425
And a lot of times you can answer with
actually a link to another scratchpad

96
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,724
where you actually
answered their questions.

97
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,787
Now if you just want to
say how awesome it is

98
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:28,395
or give a tip, you can goto
the tips and feedback panel.

99
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:35,331
And say like "Wow, this is the
coolest thing I've seen today"

100
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:39,826
And then the creator will feel really good
because they got this compliment from you.

101
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,113
And that's one of the awesome
things about programming

102
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:44,597
is that you can put out
these things in the world and

103
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,993
you never know who's going to find them
and who's day you're going to make better

104
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:51,763
because they found this really cool,
creative thing that you came up with.

105
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:56,198
So we want this to be a community
of people learning from each other,

106
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,871
and sharing their
creations with each other.

107
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:01,659
Because that's a big part of
what we love about programming.

108
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,619
It will definitely be hard at first.

109
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,688
And you're first programs
will start out small.

110
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,491
But as you keep going, you'll
be able to do more and more

111
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,493
until one day you realize that, wow, you
can do almost anything in programming.

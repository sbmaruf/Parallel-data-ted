00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,709
Dear Mr. President,

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,149
Do you know much about physics? I mean, you're
the President of the United States: a country

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,470
with five thousand nuclear weapons, birthplace
of the world's computing and telecommunications

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,920
industry, home of the first atomic clock and
creator of the global positioning system.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
But chances are, if you just took regular
American high school physics, you don't know

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:22,189
one iota about the science behind these things
(No offense). That's because high school physics

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,169
students across most of America are not required
to learn about pretty much any physical phenomena

8
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:32,869
discovered or explained more recently than
1865. Yes, 1865. That's the year the civil

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,630
war ended and well over a decade before Albert
Einstein was even born!

10
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:41,519
You know what can happen in 150 years, Mr.
President? A lot. Velcro, for one. But let

11
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,819
me list some useful and important ideas of
the last 150 years of physics that aren't

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,160
a required part of most standard US high school
physics courses:

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,810
Photons. The structure of atoms. The existence
of Antimatter. GPS. Lasers. Transistors. Diodes

14
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,829
and LEDs. Quarks. Chaos Theory. Electron Microscopy.
MRI scanning. The Big Bang. Black Holes. Star

15
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,869
formation. The fact that gravity bends light.
The fact that the universe is expanding. The

16
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,410
Higgs Boson and the weak and strong nuclear
forces and all the rest of quantum mechanics

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,960
and relativity and the topic of every single
Nobel Prize in Physics since… always. Basically,

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,020
most of the important stuff.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,090
I mean, Mr. President, imagine if history
classes didn't talk about the abolition of

20
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,480
slavery, world wars I or II, the great depression,
the rise of the US as a global superpower,

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,450
the cold war or the civil rights movement
or heaven forbid the first African American

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,950
President. Or imagine if biology classes didn't
talk about DNA, or hormones, or cell reproduction

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,780
or the modern germ theory of disease or ecology.
Or if geologists didn't talk about plate tectonics.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,060
And computer scientists… well… in 1865
a computer was a person who computed your

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,510
taxes.

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,780
Now, if you were lucky enough to have an ambitious
teacher or take Advanced Placement Physics,

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,060
then you might have learned about some of
Einstein's discoveries of 1905! Yes! Current

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,780
events! But learning about how Einstein's
work helped set the stage for a century of

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,450
amazing developments in our understanding
of the universe is not a part of the standard

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,310
curriculum.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,340
So why, Mr. President, am I addressing this
letter to you? Well, you appoint the Secretary

32
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,000
of Education, for one - and I do believe that
high school physics is somewhat related to

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,380
education.

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,570
Now, maybe your education secretary says,
"ancient physics is already hard to teach

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,850
to high schoolers. And you want us to teach
them modern physics which is even harder?!

36
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,190
Students can't really appreciate the beauty
of modern physics without fancy college level

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,250
mathematics." RUBBISH. Ever heard of Carl
Sagan? Richard Feynman? Or Neil deGrasse Tyson?

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,960
These great men have been 100% committed to
the appreciation and dissemination of the

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,120
awesomeness of the universe. And we should
be too. How else are we supposed to foster

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
and find our future brilliant innovators,
inventors, and explorers? How can we expect

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,650
to educate our citizens for the next century
if we don't teach about the last?

42
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,960
And that's not to say that we should ignore
math, either - on the contrary, math is one

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,580
of the most beautiful and awesome things in
the universe, especially because it allows

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,380
us to understand the universe.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,800
In particular, the last 150 years have borne
fruit to perhaps the most drastic changes

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
in our understanding of the universe, ever,
and these new ways of thinking and solving

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,000
problems should be the centerpiece of an education
in physics.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,480
Between you and me, Mr. President, I think
we'd better start making physics education

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,890
more awesome here in the US, otherwise the
next Carl Sagan or Richard Feynman will come

50
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,350
from somewhere with more educational foresight
- maybe even, the Internet.

51
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,480
Sincerely,

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,240
A collection of atoms known as Henry

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,880
ps you're probably super busy, but if you'd
like to hear about physics education across

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,350
the Atlantic, I highly recommend heading over
to Brady's channel, Sixty Symbols, for a perspective

55
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:44,669
from the UK. I bet you'll enjoy it.

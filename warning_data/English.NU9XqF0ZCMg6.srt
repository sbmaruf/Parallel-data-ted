1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,070
The screenplay on your home computer

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,350
The presentation at work

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,270
Those vacation photos and videos on your phone

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,750
The trip itinerary on your tablet

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,730
resumes, recipes, videos

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,259
With Google Drive, you can now access your files from wherever you are

7
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:22,099
Even the big ones

8
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,249
Whichever program you're using, just drag and drop

9
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:28,550
And there are all of your files ready to be opened by you

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,579
And shared with anyone you want

11
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,260
Forget files being too big to email

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,899
Just share them with Drive and everyone has the same file, automatically

13
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,190
That they can edit together, from anywhere

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,989
Now all your stuff, work or play, is in one place

15
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,910
Easy to find and easy to share

16
00:00:46,910 --> 99:59:59,000
Google Drive. Keep everything. Share anything.

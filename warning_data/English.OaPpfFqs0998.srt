1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,090
Welcome to the presentation
on graphing lines.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,200
Let's get started.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,530
So let's say I had the
equation-- let me make sure

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,170
that this line doesn't
show up too thick.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,370
Let's say I had the equation--
why isn't that showing up?

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:18,760
Let's see.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,990
Oh, there you go.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:26,692
y is equal to 2x plus 1.

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:29,670
So this is giving a
relationship between x and y.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,930
So say x equals 1, then y would
be 2 times 1 plus 1 or 3.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,140
So for every x that we can
think of we can think

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,350
of a corresponding y.

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,710
So let's do that.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,520
If we said that-- put
a little table here.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,850
x and y.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,630
And let's just throw out
some random numbers for x.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,940
If x was let's say, negative
1, then y would be 2 times

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,940
negative 1, which
is negative 2.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,810
Plus 1, which would
be negative 1.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,480
If x was 0 that's easy.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,310
It'd be 2 times 0, which is 0.

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,672
Plus 1, which is 1.

23
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:17,830
If x was 1, y would be
2 times 1, which is 2.

24
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,700
Plus 1, which is 3.

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,520
If x was 2, then I think
you get the idea here.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,730
y would be 5.

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,530
And we could keep on going.

28
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,540
Obviously, there are an
infinite number of x's we

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,820
could choose and we could
pick a corresponding y.

30
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,410
So now you see we have a
little table that gives the

31
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,470
relationships between x and y.

32
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,540
What we can do now is actually
graph those points on

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,500
a coordinate axis.

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,870
So let me see if I can draw
this somewhat neatly.

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,425
I'll use this line so
I get straight lines.

36
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:56,639
Okay, that's pretty good.

37
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,905
Okay, let me draw some
coordinate points.

38
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:08,210
So let's say that's 1,
that's 2, that's 3.

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,170
This is negative 1,
negative 2, negative 3.

40
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,180
So this is the x-axis.

41
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:22,288
We have 1, 2, 3.

42
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,020
Notice we could keep going.

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,576
1, 2, 3, and this
is the y-axis.

44
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:35,722
And this would be 1,
2, 3, and so on.

45
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,220
This would be negative 1.

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,360
I think you get the idea.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,550
So we can graph each
of these points.

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,440
So if we have the point x is
negative 1, y is negative 1.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,710
So x, we go along the x-axis
here, and we go to x is

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,745
equal to negative 1.

51
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:52,990
Then we go to y is equal to
negative 1, so the point

52
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,775
would be right here.

53
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,520
Hope that makes sense to you.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,670
That's the point.

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,650
I'll label it: negative
1 comma negative 1.

56
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,140
It's a little messy.

57
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,920
That says negative 1
comma negative 1.

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,330
That point I just
x'ed right there.

59
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,820
Let's do another one.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,880
That's this point.

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,280
I'll do it in a different
color this time.

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,960
Let's say we had the
point 0 comma 1.

63
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,410
Well, x is 0, which is here.

64
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,110
And y is 1, so that
point is right there.

65
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,885
Let's do one more.

66
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:25,350
If we have the point 1 comma 3.

67
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:33,140
Well, 1 comma 3, x is
1 and we have y is 3.

68
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,730
So we have the
point right there.

69
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,750
Hope that's making
sense for you.

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,180
And we could keep graphing
them, but I think you see here,

71
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,550
and especially if I had drawn
this a little bit neater, that

72
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,090
these points are
forming a line.

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,980
Let me draw that line in.

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,370
The line looks
something like this.

75
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,839
That's not a good line.

76
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,280
Let me do it better than that.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,350
The line looks
something like this.

78
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:03,865
You see that?

79
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:06,720
Well, that's actually a pretty
bad line that I just drew.

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,670
So it would be a line that goes
through-- let me change tools.

81
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,960
It'd be a line that goes
through here, through

82
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,960
here, and through here.

83
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,010
I don't know if I'm making
this clear at all.

84
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,630
Let me make these
points a little bit.

85
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,420
You see the line will go
through all of these points,

86
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,200
but it will also go through the
point 2 comma 5, which will

87
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,800
be up here some place.

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,600
For any x that you can think
of, if you had x is equal to

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,510
10,380,000,000 the
corresponding y will

90
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,770
also be on this line.

91
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,180
So this pink line, and it
keeps going on forever, that

92
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,850
represents every possible
combination of x's and y's that

93
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,580
will satisfy this equation.

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,770
And of course, x doesn't
have to just be whole

95
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,880
numbers or integers.

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,670
x could be pi-- 3.14159.

97
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,090
In which case it would be
someplace here and in which

98
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,240
case y would be 2 pi plus 1.

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,130
So every number that x could
be there's a corresponding y.

100
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,990
Let's do another 1.

101
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:21,459
So if I had the equation y is
equal to-- that's an ugly y.

102
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:29,020
y is equal to negative 3x plus 5.

103
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,180
Well, I'm going to draw it
quick and dirty this time.

104
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,180
So that's the x-axis.

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,020
That's the y-axis.

106
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,334
Let's put some values here.

107
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,630
x and y.

108
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,860
Let's say if x is negative
1, then negative 1 times

109
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,245
negative 3 is 3 plus y is 8.

110
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:52,750
If x is 0, then y is 5.

111
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,020
That's pretty easy.

112
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,690
If x is 1, negative 3
times 1 is negative 3.

113
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,620
Then y is 2.

114
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,990
If x is 2, negative 3
times 2 is negative 6.

115
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,730
Then y is 1.

116
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,070
Is that right?

117
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,610
Negative 6-- no, no.

118
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,315
Negative 1.

119
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,810
I knew something
was wrong there.

120
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,610
So let's graph some
of these points.

121
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:20,522
So when x = -1, and I'm just kind of approximating, when x = -1,

122
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:23,785
y = -8, so that point will be someplace around here.

123
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:25,680
And there's a whole module I'm
graphing coordinates if you're

124
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,540
finding the graphing a
coordinate pair to be

125
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,240
a little confusing.

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,700
Oh, wait.

127
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,790
I just made a mistake.

128
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,830
When x is negative 1, y is 9.

129
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,070
Not negative 8, so
ignore this right here.

130
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,270
When x is negative
1, y is positive 8.

131
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,610
So y being up here someplace.

132
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,540
When x is 0, y is 5.

133
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,440
So it'd be here someplace.

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,720
When x is 1, y is 2.

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,650
So it's like here.

136
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:01,827
When x is 2, y is negative 1.

137
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,550
So as you can see-- and
I've approximated it.

138
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,740
If I had graphing paper or if I
had a better drawn chart you

139
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,210
could have seen it and it would
have been exactly right.

140
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,950
I think this line
will do the job.

141
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,430
That every point that satisfies
this equation actually

142
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,470
falls on this line.

143
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,700
And something interesting
here I'll point out.

144
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,790
You notice that this line
it slopes downwards.

145
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,510
It goes from the top left
to the bottom right.

146
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,800
While the line we had drawn
before had gone from the

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,160
bottom left to the top right.

148
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,740
Is there anything about this
equation that seems a little

149
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,320
bit different than the last?

150
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,240
I'll give you a little
bit of a hint.

151
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,230
This number-- the negative 3,
or you could say that the

152
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,280
coefficient on x-- that
determines whether the line

153
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,040
slopes upward, or the line
slows downward, and it tells

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,725
you also how steep the line is.

155
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,900
And that actually,
negative 3 is the slope.

156
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,350
And I'm going to do a whole
nother module on slope.

157
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,400
And this number here is
called the y-intercept.

158
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
And that actually tells
you where you're going

159
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,970
to intersect the y-axis.

160
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,460
And it turns out here,
that you intersect the

161
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,250
axis at 0 comma 5.

162
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:19,119
Let's do one more real fast.

163
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:26,158
y is equal to 2--
we already did 2x.

164
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:35,374
y is equal to 1/2 x
plus 2 So real fast.

165
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:37,180
x and y.

166
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,270
And you only need two
points for a line, really.

167
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,120
So you could just say
let's say, x equals 0.

168
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,410
That's easy. y equals 2.

169
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,580
And if x equals 2
then y equals 3.

170
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,660
So before when we were doing 3
and 4 points that was just to

171
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,650
kind of show you, but you
really just need two

172
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,230
points for a line.

173
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,930
So 0 comma 1 2.

174
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,730
So that's on there.

175
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,320
And then 1, 2 comma 3.

176
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,950
So it's there.

177
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,110
So the line is going to
look something like this.

178
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:14,456
So notice here, once again,
we're upward sloping and that's

179
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,870
because this 1/2 is positive.

180
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,120
But we're not sloping-- we're
not moving up as quickly as

181
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,870
when we had y equals
2x. y equals 2x looked

182
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,452
something like this.

183
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:26,390
It was sloping up much,
much, much faster.

184
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,620
I hope I'm not confusing you.

185
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,710
And then the y intercept of
course is at 0 comma 2,

186
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,160
which is right here.

187
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,300
So if you ever want to graph
a line it's really easy.

188
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,760
You have to just try out some
points and you can graph it.

189
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
And now in the next module I'm
going to show you a little bit

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
more about slope and
y-intercept and you won't

191
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
even have to do this.

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,490
But this gives you good
intuitive feel, I think,

193
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,320
what a graph of a line is.

194
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,250
I hope you have fun.

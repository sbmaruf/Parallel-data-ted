Hi! I'm Michelle, founder of Macchiatto --

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,800
a boutique, branding and packaging firm in San Francisco.

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:13,444
I use Evernote Smart Notebook all the time for sketches and inspiration.

4
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:19,999
Thinking visually can be very cumbersome, 

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,580
so having Evernote helps me keep everything organized in one place.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I literally take it everywhere because you'll never know 

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,480
when a design idea will come.

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,700
The project I'm working on right now is seasonal greeting cards

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,440
that will be sent up to our clients.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,010
I always start by sketching out rough ideas,

11
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:43,008
then I take the most successful sketches and refine them.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,700
When I want to save my designs to Evernote I tag it with a Smart Sticker.

13
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:52,343
Then snap a picture with Evernote's Page Camera.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,780
My favorite part is that I can take the sticker with me wherever I want.

15
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:58,723
This sticker here sends my drawing to a shared notebook.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,820
When I need to find it later 

17
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:03,818
I use Evernote Search to bring it up anytime.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,350
As a visual thinker, sketching on paper is a critical part of the process.

19
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:11,877
My ideas are everywhere.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
Being able to save to Evernote quickly and easily 

21
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:17,877
helps me stay organized and ultimately makes my work better.

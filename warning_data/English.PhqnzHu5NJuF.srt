1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Planetary systems outside our own

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but whose streets we can't walk.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
By studying those twinkling lights though,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we can learn about how stars and planets interact

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to form their own ecosystem

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and make habitats that are amenable to life.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In this image of the Tokyo skyline,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've hidden data

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the Kepler Mission.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Can you see it?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There we go.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
where it searches for planets

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
all at once, every half hour,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and very precisely.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And what we're looking for

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is the tiny dimming of light

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In just over two years of operations,

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we've found over 1,200

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
potential new planetary systems around other stars.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To give you some perspective,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
in the previous two decades of searching,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we had only known about 400

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
prior to Kepler.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
When we see these little dips in the light,

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
we can determine a number of things.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but also how big that planet is

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and how far it is away from its parent star.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That distance is really important

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because it tells us

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
how much light the planet receives overall.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but not so close

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that you're too toasty and you get burned.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
However, there's more to know about your parent star

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
than just how much light you receive overall.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I'll tell you why.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is our star. This is our Sun.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's shown here in visible light.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You'll notice that it looks pretty much

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
like the iconic yellow ball --

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that Sun that we all draw when we're children.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But you'll notice something else,

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and that's that the face of the Sun

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
has freckles.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
These freckles are called sunspots,

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and they are just one of the manifestations

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of the Sun's magnetic field.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They also cause the light from the star to vary.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And we can measure this

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
we would really see

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the dynamic and dramatic effects

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
of our Sun's magnetic activity --

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
these kind of events are happening

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in the sky above you all the time.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
whether it might be amenable to life,

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
we want to know not only how much total light it receives

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and how warm it is,

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
but we want to know about its space weather --

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
this high-energy radiation,

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the UV and the X-rays

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that are created by its star

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And so, we can't really look

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
at planets around other stars

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
in the same kind of detail

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that we can look at planets in our own solar system.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but only one of which

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is really a good place to live.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But what we can do in the meantime

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
is measure the light from our stars

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and learn about this relationship

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
between the planets and their parent stars

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to suss out clues

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
about which planets might be good places

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to look for life in the universe.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Kepler won't find a planet

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
around every single star it looks at.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But really, every measurement it makes

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is precious,

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
because it's teaching us about the relationship

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
between stars and planets,

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and how it's really the starlight

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that sets the stage

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
for the formation of life in the universe.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
it's we, life, who are searching.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000

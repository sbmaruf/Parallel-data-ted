00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,900
-CHAPTER 15

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,189
'I did not start in search of Jim at once,only because I had really an appointment

3
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,509
which I could not neglect.

4
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:25,140
Then, as ill-luck would have it, in myagent's office I was fastened upon by a

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,480
fellow fresh from Madagascar with a littlescheme for a wonderful piece of business.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,030
It had something to do with cattle andcartridges and a Prince Ravonalo something;

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,649
but the pivot of the whole affair was thestupidity of some admiral--Admiral Pierre,

8
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,780
I think.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,210
Everything turned on that, and the chapcouldn't find words strong enough to

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,239
express his confidence.

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,840
He had globular eyes starting out of hishead with a fishy glitter, bumps on his

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,699
forehead, and wore his long hair brushedback without a parting.

13
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,789
He had a favourite phrase which he kept onrepeating triumphantly, "The minimum of

14
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:08,530
risk with the maximum of profit is mymotto.

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,690
What?"

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,420
He made my head ache, spoiled my tiffin,but got his own out of me all right; and as

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
soon as I had shaken him off, I madestraight for the water-side.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,610
I caught sight of Jim leaning over theparapet of the quay.

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,030
Three native boatmen quarrelling over fiveannas were making an awful row at his

20
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,390
elbow.

21
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,729
He didn't hear me come up, but spun roundas if the slight contact of my finger had

22
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,360
released a catch."I was looking," he stammered.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,689
I don't remember what I said, not muchanyhow, but he made no difficulty in

24
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,630
following me to the hotel.

25
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,710
'He followed me as manageable as a littlechild, with an obedient air, with no sort

26
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,049
of manifestation, rather as though he hadbeen waiting for me there to come along and

27
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,450
carry him off.

28
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,180
I need not have been so surprised as I wasat his tractability.

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,950
On all the round earth, which to some seemsso big and that others affect to consider

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,980
as rather smaller than a mustard-seed, hehad no place where he could--what shall I

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,510
say?--where he could withdraw.

32
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,560
That's it!Withdraw--be alone with his loneliness.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,100
He walked by my side very calm, glancinghere and there, and once turned his head to

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,010
look after a Sidiboy fireman in a cutawaycoat and yellowish trousers, whose black

35
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,959
face had silky gleams like a lump ofanthracite coal.

36
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,160
I doubt, however, whether he saw anything,or even remained all the time aware of my

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,799
companionship, because if I had not edgedhim to the left here, or pulled him to the

38
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,380
right there, I believe he would have gone

39
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,160
straight before him in any direction tillstopped by a wall or some other obstacle.

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,190
I steered him into my bedroom, and sat downat once to write letters.

41
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,130
This was the only place in the world(unless, perhaps, the Walpole Reef--but

42
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,109
that was not so handy) where he could haveit out with himself without being bothered

43
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,239
by the rest of the universe.

44
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,859
The damned thing--as he had expressed it--had not made him invisible, but I behaved

45
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,060
exactly as though he were.

46
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,500
No sooner in my chair I bent over mywriting-desk like a medieval scribe, and,

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,560
but for the movement of the hand holdingthe pen, remained anxiously quiet.

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,290
I can't say I was frightened; but Icertainly kept as still as if there had

49
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,139
been something dangerous in the room, thatat the first hint of a movement on my part

50
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:48,290
would be provoked to pounce upon me.

51
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,290
There was not much in the room--you knowhow these bedrooms are--a sort of four-

52
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,660
poster bedstead under a mosquito-net, twoor three chairs, the table I was writing

53
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,479
at, a bare floor.

54
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,419
A glass door opened on an upstairsverandah, and he stood with his face to it,

55
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,479
having a hard time with all possibleprivacy.

56
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,259
Dusk fell; I lit a candle with the greatesteconomy of movement and as much prudence as

57
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:17,190
though it were an illegal proceeding.

58
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,049
There is no doubt that he had a very hardtime of it, and so had I, even to the

59
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,910
point, I must own, of wishing him to thedevil, or on Walpole Reef at least.

60
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,380
It occurred to me once or twice that, afterall, Chester was, perhaps, the man to deal

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,440
effectively with such a disaster.That strange idealist had found a practical

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,320
use for it at once--unerringly, as it were.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,930
It was enough to make one suspect that,maybe, he really could see the true aspect

64
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,420
of things that appeared mysterious orutterly hopeless to less imaginative

65
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,980
persons.

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,480
I wrote and wrote; I liquidated all thearrears of my correspondence, and then went

67
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,440
on writing to people who had no reasonwhatever to expect from me a gossipy letter

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,480
about nothing at all.

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,690
At times I stole a sidelong glance.He was rooted to the spot, but convulsive

70
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,870
shudders ran down his back; his shoulderswould heave suddenly.

71
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,690
He was fighting, he was fighting--mostlyfor his breath, as it seemed.

72
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,990
The massive shadows, cast all one way fromthe straight flame of the candle, seemed

73
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,810
possessed of gloomy consciousness; theimmobility of the furniture had to my

74
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,850
furtive eye an air of attention.

75
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,810
I was becoming fanciful in the midst of myindustrious scribbling; and though, when

76
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,900
the scratching of my pen stopped for amoment, there was complete silence and

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,530
stillness in the room, I suffered from that

78
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,060
profound disturbance and confusion ofthought which is caused by a violent and

79
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,790
menacing uproar--of a heavy gale at sea,for instance.

80
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,780
Some of you may know what I mean: thatmingled anxiety, distress, and irritation

81
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,430
with a sort of craven feeling creeping in--not pleasant to acknowledge, but which

82
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,080
gives a quite special merit to one'sendurance.

83
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,310
I don't claim any merit for standing thestress of Jim's emotions; I could take

84
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,790
refuge in the letters; I could have writtento strangers if necessary.

85
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,720
Suddenly, as I was taking up a fresh sheetof notepaper, I heard a low sound, the

86
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,160
first sound that, since we had been shut uptogether, had come to my ears in the dim

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,350
stillness of the room.

88
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,240
I remained with my head down, with my handarrested.

89
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
Those who have kept vigil by a sick-bedhave heard such faint sounds in the

90
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,660
stillness of the night watches, soundswrung from a racked body, from a weary

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,220
soul.

92
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,490
He pushed the glass door with such forcethat all the panes rang: he stepped out,

93
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,220
and I held my breath, straining my earswithout knowing what else I expected to

94
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,620
hear.

95
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,240
He was really taking too much to heart anempty formality which to Chester's rigorous

96
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,810
criticism seemed unworthy the notice of aman who could see things as they were.

97
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,000
An empty formality; a piece of parchment.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,180
Well, well.As to an inaccessible guano deposit, that

99
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,660
was another story altogether.One could intelligibly break one's heart

100
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,090
over that.

101
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,360
A feeble burst of many voices mingled withthe tinkle of silver and glass floated up

102
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,770
from the dining-room below; through theopen door the outer edge of the light from

103
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,169
my candle fell on his back faintly; beyond

104
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:46,200
all was black; he stood on the brink of avast obscurity, like a lonely figure by the

105
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,419
shore of a sombre and hopeless ocean.

106
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,949
There was the Walpole Reef in it--to besure--a speck in the dark void, a straw for

107
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,740
the drowning man.

108
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,930
My compassion for him took the shape of thethought that I wouldn't have liked his

109
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,740
people to see him at that moment.I found it trying myself.

110
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,010
His back was no longer shaken by his gasps;he stood straight as an arrow, faintly

111
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,199
visible and still; and the meaning of thisstillness sank to the bottom of my soul

112
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,040
like lead into the water, and made it so

113
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,639
heavy that for a second I wished heartilythat the only course left open for me was

114
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,090
to pay for his funeral.Even the law had done with him.

115
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,139
To bury him would have been such an easykindness!

116
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,579
It would have been so much in accordancewith the wisdom of life, which consists in

117
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:41,089
putting out of sight all the reminders ofour folly, of our weakness, of our

118
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,770
mortality; all that makes against our

119
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,020
efficiency--the memory of our failures, thehints of our undying fears, the bodies of

120
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,210
our dead friends.Perhaps he did take it too much to heart.

121
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:01,880
And if so then--Chester's offer....At thispoint I took up a fresh sheet and began to

122
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,930
write resolutely.There was nothing but myself between him

123
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,630
and the dark ocean.

124
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,360
I had a sense of responsibility.If I spoke, would that motionless and

125
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,020
suffering youth leap into the obscurity--clutch at the straw?

126
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,770
I found out how difficult it may besometimes to make a sound.

127
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,980
There is a weird power in a spoken word.And why the devil not?

128
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,580
I was asking myself persistently while Idrove on with my writing.

129
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,710
All at once, on the blank page, under thevery point of the pen, the two figures of

130
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,100
Chester and his antique partner, verydistinct and complete, would dodge into

131
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,670
view with stride and gestures, as if

132
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,250
reproduced in the field of some opticaltoy.

133
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,240
I would watch them for a while.No!

134
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,740
They were too phantasmal and extravagant toenter into any one's fate.

135
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,980
And a word carries far--very far--dealsdestruction through time as the bullets go

136
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,050
flying through space.

137
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,650
I said nothing; and he, out there with hisback to the light, as if bound and gagged

138
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:18,460
by all the invisible foes of man, made nostir and made no sound.'

139
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,990
CHAPTER 16

140
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,210
'The time was coming when I should see himloved, trusted, admired, with a legend of

141
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:33,410
strength and prowess forming round his nameas though he had been the stuff of a hero.

142
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,200
It's true--I assure you; as true as I'msitting here talking about him in vain.

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,140
He, on his side, had that faculty ofbeholding at a hint the face of his desire

144
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,940
and the shape of his dream, without whichthe earth would know no lover and no

145
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,660
adventurer.

146
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,600
He captured much honour and an Arcadianhappiness (I won't say anything about

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,410
innocence) in the bush, and it was as goodto him as the honour and the Arcadian

148
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,850
happiness of the streets to another man.

149
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:14,140
Felicity, felicity--how shall I say it?--isquaffed out of a golden cup in every

150
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:20,580
latitude: the flavour is with you--with youalone, and you can make it as intoxicating

151
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,279
as you please.

152
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,390
He was of the sort that would drink deep,as you may guess from what went before.

153
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,470
I found him, if not exactly intoxicated,then at least flushed with the elixir at

154
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,000
his lips.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,610
He had not obtained it at once.

156
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,970
There had been, as you know, a period ofprobation amongst infernal ship-chandlers,

157
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:51,230
during which he had suffered and I hadworried about--about--my trust--you may

158
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,589
call it.

159
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:57,420
I don't know that I am completely reassurednow, after beholding him in all his

160
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,970
brilliance.

161
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,760
That was my last view of him--in a stronglight, dominating, and yet in complete

162
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,750
accord with his surroundings--with the lifeof the forests and with the life of men.

163
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,160
I own that I was impressed, but I mustadmit to myself that after all this is not

164
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,770
the lasting impression.

165
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:25,540
He was protected by his isolation, alone ofhis own superior kind, in close touch with

166
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,149
Nature, that keeps faith on such easy termswith her lovers.

167
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,589
But I cannot fix before my eye the image ofhis safety.

168
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:41,120
I shall always remember him as seen throughthe open door of my room, taking, perhaps,

169
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,920
too much to heart the mere consequences ofhis failure.

170
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,800
I am pleased, of course, that some good--and even some splendour--came out of my

171
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,140
endeavours; but at times it seems to me itwould have been better for my peace of mind

172
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,120
if I had not stood between him andChester's confoundedly generous offer.

173
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,839
I wonder what his exuberant imaginationwould have made of Walpole islet--that most

174
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,810
hopelessly forsaken crumb of dry land onthe face of the waters.

175
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,560
It is not likely I would ever have heard,for I must tell you that Chester, after

176
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:24,190
calling at some Australian port to patch uphis brig-rigged sea-anachronism, steamed

177
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,330
out into the Pacific with a crew of twenty-

178
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,750
two hands all told, and the only newshaving a possible bearing upon the mystery

179
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,310
of his fate was the news of a hurricanewhich is supposed to have swept in its

180
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,640
course over the Walpole shoals, a month orso afterwards.

181
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,339
Not a vestige of the Argonauts ever turnedup; not a sound came out of the waste.

182
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:47,810
Finis!

183
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,740
The Pacific is the most discreet of live,hot-tempered oceans: the chilly Antarctic

184
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,950
can keep a secret too, but more in themanner of a grave.

185
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,649
'And there is a sense of blessed finalityin such discretion, which is what we all

186
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:10,490
more or less sincerely are ready to admit--for what else is it that makes the idea of

187
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,420
death supportable?

188
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,470
End!Finis! the potent word that exorcises from

189
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,390
the house of life the haunting shadow offate.

190
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:27,820
This is what--notwithstanding the testimonyof my eyes and his own earnest assurances--

191
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,269
I miss when I look back upon Jim's success.While there's life there is hope, truly;

192
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,720
but there is fear too.

193
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,440
I don't mean to say that I regret myaction, nor will I pretend that I can't

194
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,490
sleep o' nights in consequence; still, theidea obtrudes itself that he made so much

195
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,370
of his disgrace while it is the guilt alonethat matters.

196
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,620
He was not--if I may say so--clear to me.He was not clear.

197
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,600
And there is a suspicion he was not clearto himself either.

198
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,820
There were his fine sensibilities, his finefeelings, his fine longings--a sort of

199
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,040
sublimated, idealised selfishness.

200
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:21,470
He was--if you allow me to say so--veryfine; very fine--and very unfortunate.

201
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,170
A little coarser nature would not haveborne the strain; it would have had to come

202
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:32,420
to terms with itself--with a sigh, with agrunt, or even with a guffaw; a still

203
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,200
coarser one would have remained

204
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,200
invulnerably ignorant and completelyuninteresting.

205
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,450
'But he was too interesting or toounfortunate to be thrown to the dogs, or

206
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,200
even to Chester.

207
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,329
I felt this while I sat with my face overthe paper and he fought and gasped,

208
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:58,300
struggling for his breath in that terriblystealthy way, in my room; I felt it when he

209
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,850
rushed out on the verandah as if to fling

210
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:07,930
himself over--and didn't; I felt it moreand more all the time he remained outside,

211
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,860
faintly lighted on the background of night,as if standing on the shore of a sombre and

212
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,649
hopeless sea.

213
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:20,140
'An abrupt heavy rumble made me lift myhead.

214
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,540
The noise seemed to roll away, and suddenlya searching and violent glare fell on the

215
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,589
blind face of the night.

216
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:33,290
The sustained and dazzling flickers seemedto last for an unconscionable time.

217
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,620
The growl of the thunder increased steadilywhile I looked at him, distinct and black,

218
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,920
planted solidly upon the shores of a sea oflight.

219
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,589
At the moment of greatest brilliance thedarkness leaped back with a culminating

220
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,399
crash, and he vanished before my dazzledeyes as utterly as though he had been blown

221
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,260
to atoms.

222
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,850
A blustering sigh passed; furious handsseemed to tear at the shrubs, shake the

223
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,299
tops of the trees below, slam doors, breakwindow-panes, all along the front of the

224
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,480
building.

225
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,589
He stepped in, closing the door behind him,and found me bending over the table: my

226
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,749
sudden anxiety as to what he would say wasvery great, and akin to a fright.

227
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,879
"May I have a cigarette?" he asked.

228
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:26,419
I gave a push to the box without raising myhead.

229
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:34,739
"I want--want--tobacco," he muttered.I became extremely buoyant.

230
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:35,950
"Just a moment."

231
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,869
I grunted pleasantly.He took a few steps here and there.

232
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:47,679
"That's over," I heard him say.A single distant clap of thunder came from

233
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,999
the sea like a gun of distress.

234
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:58,269
"The monsoon breaks up early this year," heremarked conversationally, somewhere behind

235
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,190
me.

236
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,139
This encouraged me to turn round, which Idid as soon as I had finished addressing

237
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,919
the last envelope.

238
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,919
He was smoking greedily in the middle ofthe room, and though he heard the stir I

239
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,970
made, he remained with his back to me for atime.

240
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:20,779
'"Come--I carried it off pretty well," hesaid, wheeling suddenly.

241
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:27,190
"Something's paid off--not much.I wonder what's to come."

242
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,200
His face did not show any emotion, only itappeared a little darkened and swollen, as

243
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,960
though he had been holding his breath.

244
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,480
He smiled reluctantly as it were, and wenton while I gazed up at him mutely...."Thank

245
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:50,679
you, though--your room--jolly convenient--for a chap--badly hipped."...

246
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,450
The rain pattered and swished in thegarden; a water-pipe (it must have had a

247
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,940
hole in it) performed just outside thewindow a parody of blubbering woe with

248
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,149
funny sobs and gurgling lamentations,

249
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:11,100
interrupted by jerky spasms ofsilence...."A bit of shelter," he mumbled

250
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,019
and ceased.

251
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:19,759
'A flash of faded lightning darted inthrough the black framework of the windows

252
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,159
and ebbed out without any noise.

253
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:28,239
I was thinking how I had best approach him(I did not want to be flung off again) when

254
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,049
he gave a little laugh.

255
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:35,590
"No better than a vagabond now"...the endof the cigarette smouldered between his

256
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:45,259
fingers..."without a single--single," hepronounced slowly; "and yet ..."

257
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:49,720
He paused; the rain fell with redoubledviolence.

258
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,350
"Some day one's bound to come upon somesort of chance to get it all back again.

259
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:03,739
Must!" he whispered distinctly, glaring atmy boots.

260
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:09,700
'I did not even know what it was he wishedso much to regain, what it was he had so

261
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,269
terribly missed.

262
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:15,590
It might have been so much that it wasimpossible to say.

263
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,629
A piece of ass's skin, according toChester....

264
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:23,399
He looked up at me inquisitively.

265
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,679
"Perhaps.If life's long enough," I muttered through

266
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,039
my teeth with unreasonable animosity."Don't reckon too much on it."

267
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:32,669
'"Jove!

268
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:40,590
I feel as if nothing could ever touch me,"he said in a tone of sombre conviction.

269
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,330
"If this business couldn't knock me over,then there's no fear of there being not

270
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,649
enough time to--climb out, and ..."

271
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:55,119
He looked upwards.'It struck me that it is from such as he

272
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:01,659
that the great army of waifs and strays isrecruited, the army that marches down, down

273
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,779
into all the gutters of the earth.

274
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:09,859
As soon as he left my room, that "bit ofshelter," he would take his place in the

275
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:13,850
ranks, and begin the journey towards thebottomless pit.

276
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,129
I at least had no illusions; but it was I,too, who a moment ago had been so sure of

277
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:26,460
the power of words, and now was afraid tospeak, in the same way one dares not move

278
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,440
for fear of losing a slippery hold.

279
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,840
It is when we try to grapple with anotherman's intimate need that we perceive how

280
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,159
incomprehensible, wavering, and misty arethe beings that share with us the sight of

281
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,190
the stars and the warmth of the sun.

282
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,639
It is as if loneliness were a hard andabsolute condition of existence; the

283
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:53,399
envelope of flesh and blood on which oureyes are fixed melts before the

284
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,200
outstretched hand, and there remains only

285
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,659
the capricious, unconsolable, and elusivespirit that no eye can follow, no hand can

286
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,039
grasp.

287
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,340
It was the fear of losing him that kept mesilent, for it was borne upon me suddenly

288
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,100
and with unaccountable force that should Ilet him slip away into the darkness I would

289
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,080
never forgive myself.

290
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,499
'"Well.Thanks--once more.

291
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:27,509
You've been--er--uncommonly--really there'sno word to...Uncommonly!

292
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,970
I don't know why, I am sure.

293
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,539
I am afraid I don't feel as grateful as Iwould if the whole thing hadn't been so

294
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,570
brutally sprung on me.Because at bottom...you, yourself ..."

295
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,169
He stuttered.

296
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,320
'"Possibly," I struck in.He frowned.

297
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,940
'"All the same, one is responsible."He watched me like a hawk.

298
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,350
'"And that's true, too," I said.

299
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,729
'"Well.I've gone with it to the end, and I don't

300
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:06,259
intend to let any man cast it in my teethwithout--without--resenting it."

301
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,350
He clenched his fist.

302
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:14,639
'"There's yourself," I said with a smile--mirthless enough, God knows--but he looked

303
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:18,659
at me menacingly."That's my business," he said.

304
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:25,320
An air of indomitable resolution came andwent upon his face like a vain and passing

305
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,769
shadow.Next moment he looked a dear good boy in

306
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:30,529
trouble, as before.

307
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,309
He flung away the cigarette.

308
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,460
"Good-bye," he said, with the sudden hasteof a man who had lingered too long in view

309
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,259
of a pressing bit of work waiting for him;and then for a second or so he made not the

310
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,549
slightest movement.

311
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,809
The downpour fell with the heavyuninterrupted rush of a sweeping flood,

312
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:55,149
with a sound of unchecked overwhelming furythat called to one's mind the images of

313
00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:00,599
collapsing bridges, of uprooted trees, ofundermined mountains.

314
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,070
No man could breast the colossal andheadlong stream that seemed to break and

315
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,679
swirl against the dim stillness in which wewere precariously sheltered as if on an

316
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,179
island.

317
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:18,499
The perforated pipe gurgled, choked, spat,and splashed in odious ridicule of a

318
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:24,230
swimmer fighting for his life."It is raining," I remonstrated, "and I

319
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,809
..."

320
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:30,519
"Rain or shine," he began brusquely,checked himself, and walked to the window.

321
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,049
"Perfect deluge," he muttered after awhile: he leaned his forehead on the glass.

322
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,590
"It's dark, too."

323
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,609
'"Yes, it is very dark," I said.'He pivoted on his heels, crossed the room,

324
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,789
and had actually opened the door leadinginto the corridor before I leaped up from

325
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,820
my chair.

326
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,799
"Wait," I cried, "I want you to ...""I can't dine with you again to-night," he

327
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,059
flung at me, with one leg out of the roomalready.

328
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:03,009
"I haven't the slightest intention to askyou," I shouted.

329
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:08,379
At this he drew back his foot, but remainedmistrustfully in the very doorway.

330
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:14,460
I lost no time in entreating him earnestlynot to be absurd; to come in and shut the

331
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,749
door.'

332
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,509
CHAPTER 17

333
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:26,259
'He came in at last; but I believe it wasmostly the rain that did it; it was falling

334
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:31,450
just then with a devastating violence whichquieted down gradually while we talked.

335
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,539
His manner was very sober and set; hisbearing was that of a naturally taciturn

336
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,029
man possessed by an idea.

337
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:44,849
My talk was of the material aspect of hisposition; it had the sole aim of saving him

338
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:50,440
from the degradation, ruin, and despairthat out there close so swiftly upon a

339
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,669
friendless, homeless man; I pleaded with

340
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:59,599
him to accept my help; I argued reasonably:and every time I looked up at that absorbed

341
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,549
smooth face, so grave and youthful, I had adisturbing sense of being no help but

342
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:08,399
rather an obstacle to some mysterious,

343
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,820
inexplicable, impalpable striving of hiswounded spirit.

344
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,649
'"I suppose you intend to eat and drink andto sleep under shelter in the usual way,"

345
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:22,200
I remember saying with irritation.

346
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,899
"You say you won't touch the money that isdue to you."...He came as near as his sort

347
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:31,919
can to making a gesture of horror.(There were three weeks and five days' pay

348
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,729
owing him as mate of the Patna.)

349
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:38,849
"Well, that's too little to matter anyhow;but what will you do to-morrow?

350
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,099
Where will you turn?You must live ..."

351
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,840
"That isn't the thing," was the commentthat escaped him under his breath.

352
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,539
I ignored it, and went on combating what Iassumed to be the scruples of an

353
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,950
exaggerated delicacy.

354
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,559
"On every conceivable ground," I concluded,"you must let me help you."

355
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:06,309
"You can't," he said very simply andgently, and holding fast to some deep idea

356
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,330
which I could detect shimmering like a poolof water in the dark, but which I despaired

357
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,519
of ever approaching near enough to fathom.

358
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,769
I surveyed his well-proportioned bulk."At any rate," I said, "I am able to help

359
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,119
what I can see of you.I don't pretend to do more."

360
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,830
He shook his head sceptically withoutlooking at me.

361
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,809
I got very warm."But I can," I insisted.

362
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:32,399
"I can do even more.

363
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,090
I am doing more.I am trusting you ..."

364
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,919
"The money ..." he began.

365
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,349
"Upon my word you deserve being told to goto the devil," I cried, forcing the note of

366
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:48,029
indignation.He was startled, smiled, and I pressed my

367
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:49,509
attack home.

368
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:55,229
"It isn't a question of money at all.You are too superficial," I said (and at

369
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:59,059
the same time I was thinking to myself:Well, here goes!

370
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:02,879
And perhaps he is, after all).

371
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:07,229
"Look at the letter I want you to take.I am writing to a man of whom I've never

372
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:12,489
asked a favour, and I am writing about youin terms that one only ventures to use when

373
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,710
speaking of an intimate friend.

374
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,919
I make myself unreservedly responsible foryou.

375
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,849
That's what I am doing.And really if you will only reflect a

376
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:24,739
little what that means ..."

377
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:29,159
'He lifted his head.The rain had passed away; only the water-

378
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,440
pipe went on shedding tears with an absurddrip, drip outside the window.

379
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,940
It was very quiet in the room, whoseshadows huddled together in corners, away

380
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,809
from the still flame of the candle flaringupright in the shape of a dagger; his face

381
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:47,379
after a while seemed suffused by a

382
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:50,869
reflection of a soft light as if the dawnhad broken already.

383
00:28:50,869 --> 00:29:00,700
'"Jove!" he gasped out."It is noble of you!"

384
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,759
'Had he suddenly put out his tongue at mein derision, I could not have felt more

385
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,279
humiliated.

386
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,549
I thought to myself--Serve me right for asneaking humbug....His eyes shone straight

387
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:16,340
into my face, but I perceived it was not amocking brightness.

388
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,090
All at once he sprang into jerky agitation,like one of those flat wooden figures that

389
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,309
are worked by a string.His arms went up, then came down with a

390
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:27,330
slap.

391
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:33,229
He became another man altogether."And I had never seen," he shouted; then

392
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,599
suddenly bit his lip and frowned.

393
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:44,039
"What a bally ass I've been," he said veryslow in an awed tone...."You are a brick!"

394
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,109
he cried next in a muffled voice.

395
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:51,989
He snatched my hand as though he had justthen seen it for the first time, and

396
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,799
dropped it at once.

397
00:29:53,799 --> 00:30:01,119
"Why! this is what I--you--I ..." hestammered, and then with a return of his

398
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:08,739
old stolid, I may say mulish, manner hebegan heavily, "I would be a brute now if I

399
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,090
..." and then his voice seemed to break.

400
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:15,559
"That's all right," I said.I was almost alarmed by this display of

401
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,539
feeling, through which pierced a strangeelation.

402
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,989
I had pulled the string accidentally, as itwere; I did not fully understand the

403
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,700
working of the toy."I must go now," he said.

404
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,820
"Jove!

405
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,419
You have helped me.Can't sit still.

406
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,090
The very thing ..."He looked at me with puzzled admiration.

407
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,289
"The very thing ..."

408
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:45,519
'Of course it was the thing.It was ten to one that I had saved him from

409
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,940
starvation--of that peculiar sort that isalmost invariably associated with drink.

410
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,239
This was all.

411
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:58,749
I had not a single illusion on that score,but looking at him, I allowed myself to

412
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:03,529
wonder at the nature of the one he had,within the last three minutes, so evidently

413
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,779
taken into his bosom.

414
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:10,869
I had forced into his hand the means tocarry on decently the serious business of

415
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:17,139
life, to get food, drink, and shelter ofthe customary kind while his wounded

416
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:19,549
spirit, like a bird with a broken wing,

417
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:26,719
might hop and flutter into some hole to diequietly of inanition there.

418
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:33,450
This is what I had thrust upon him: adefinitely small thing; and--behold!--by

419
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,269
the manner of its reception it loomed inthe dim light of the candle like a big,

420
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:43,279
indistinct, perhaps a dangerous shadow.

421
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,809
"You don't mind me not saying anythingappropriate," he burst out.

422
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,249
"There isn't anything one could say.Last night already you had done me no end

423
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:54,609
of good.

424
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:58,649
Listening to me--you know.I give you my word I've thought more than

425
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,179
once the top of my head would fly off..."

426
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:07,809
He darted--positively darted--here andthere, rammed his hands into his pockets,

427
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,469
jerked them out again, flung his cap on hishead.

428
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:15,779
I had no idea it was in him to be so airilybrisk.

429
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:20,210
I thought of a dry leaf imprisoned in aneddy of wind, while a mysterious

430
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:25,779
apprehension, a load of indefinite doubt,weighed me down in my chair.

431
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:30,690
He stood stock-still, as if struckmotionless by a discovery.

432
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,909
"You have given me confidence," hedeclared, soberly.

433
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:37,070
"Oh! for God's sake, my dear fellow--don't!"

434
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,539
I entreated, as though he had hurt me."All right.

435
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,899
I'll shut up now and henceforth.

436
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:47,929
Can't prevent me thinking though....Nevermind!...I'll show yet ..."

437
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:52,489
He went to the door in a hurry, paused withhis head down, and came back, stepping

438
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:53,669
deliberately.

439
00:32:53,669 --> 00:33:01,769
"I always thought that if a fellow couldbegin with a clean slate...And now you...in

440
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:05,899
a measure...yes...clean slate."

441
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:10,979
I waved my hand, and he marched out withoutlooking back; the sound of his footfalls

442
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:16,559
died out gradually behind the closed door--the unhesitating tread of a man walking in

443
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,960
broad daylight.

444
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,460
'But as to me, left alone with the solitarycandle, I remained strangely unenlightened.

445
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,109
I was no longer young enough to behold atevery turn the magnificence that besets our

446
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:36,059
insignificant footsteps in good and inevil.

447
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:42,129
I smiled to think that, after all, it wasyet he, of us two, who had the light.

448
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:46,619
And I felt sad.A clean slate, did he say?

449
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:52,909
As if the initial word of each our destinywere not graven in imperishable characters

450
00:33:52,909 --> 99:59:59,999
upon the face of a rock.'

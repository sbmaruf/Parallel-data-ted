1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,360
A ball is shot into the air
from the edge of a building,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,500
50 feet above the ground.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,800
Its initial velocity
is 20 feet per second.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,960
The equation h--
and I'm guessing

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,340
h is for height-- is equal to
negative 16t squared plus 20t

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,890
plus 50 can be used to
model the height of the ball

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,030
after t seconds.

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,569
And I think in this
problem they just

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,360
want us to accept this
formula, although we

10
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,211
do derive formulas
like this and show

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,260
why it works for this type of
problem in the Khan Academy

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,230
physics playlist.

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,980
But for here, we'll just go
with the flow on this example.

14
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,355
So they give us
the equation that

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,150
can be used to model the height
of the ball after t seconds,

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,730
and then say about
how long does it

17
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,380
take for the ball
to hit the ground.

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,010
So if this is the
height, the ground

19
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,070
is when the height
is equal to 0.

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,070
So hitting the ground
means-- this literally

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,120
means that h is equal to 0.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,790
So we need to figure out at
which times does h equal 0.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,810
So we're really
solving the equation

24
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:07,230
0 is equal to negative 16t
squared plus 20t plus 50.

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,320
And if you want to simplify
this a little bit-- let's see,

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,480
everything here is
divisible at least by 2.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,230
And let's divide
everything by negative 2,

28
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,401
just so that we can get rid
of this negative leading

29
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:18,026
coefficient.

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,230
So you divide the left
hand side by negative 2,

31
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,870
you still get a 0.

32
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,580
Negative 16 divided
by negative 2 is 8.

33
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,020
So 8t squared.

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,760
20 divided by negative
2 is negative 10.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,940
Minus 10t.

36
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,830
50 divided by negative
2 is minus 25.

37
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,470
And so we have 8t squared minus
10t minus 25 is equal to 0.

38
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,845
Or if you're comfortable with
this on the left hand side,

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,210
we can put on the
left hand side.

40
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:44,974
We could just say
this is equal to 0.

41
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,650
And now we solve.

42
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,310
And we could complete
this square here,

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,470
or we can just apply the
quadratic formula, which

44
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,090
is derived from
completing the square.

45
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,150
And we have this
in standard form.

46
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,340
We know that this is our a.

47
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,530
This right over here is our b.

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,890
And this over here is our c.

49
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,420
And the quadratic formula
tells us that the roots--

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,040
and in this case, it's in
terms of the variable t--

51
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,539
are going to be
equal to negative b

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,950
plus or minus the
square root of b squared

53
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,900
minus 4ac, all of that over 2a.

54
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,440
So if we apply it, we get
t is equal to negative b.

55
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:26,855
b is negative 10.

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,300
So negative negative 10 is
going to be positive 10.

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Plus or minus the square
root of negative 10 squared.

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,030
Well, that's just positive
100, minus 4 times a,

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,600
which is 8, times c,
which is negative 25.

60
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,630
And all of that over 2a.

61
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,730
a Is 8.

62
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,180
So 2 times 8 is 16.

63
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,520
And this over here,
we have a-- let's

64
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,430
see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

65
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,305
The negative sign,
negative times a negative,

66
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,890
these are going to be positive.

67
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,310
4 times 25 is 100,
times 8 is 800.

68
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,290
So all that simplifies to 800.

69
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,250
And we have 100 plus 800
under the radical sign.

70
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,370
So this is equal
to 10 plus or minus

71
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,780
the square root of 900,
all of that over 16.

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,450
And this is equal to 10 plus
or minus-- square root of 900

73
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,110
is 30-- over 16.

74
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,160
And so we get time is equal
to 10 plus 30 over 16,

75
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,940
is 40 over 16, which is
the same thing if we divide

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,950
the numerator and denominator
by 4 to simplify it as 10 over--

77
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,040
or actually even better, divide
it by 8-- that's 5 over 2.

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,160
So that's one solution,
if we add the 30.

79
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,410
If we subtract the 30,
we'd get 10 minus 30.

80
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,480
Or t is equal to 10 minus 30,
which is negative 20 over 16.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,470
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 4,

82
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,010
you get negative 5 over 4.

83
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,740
Now, we have to remember,
we're trying to find a time.

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,350
And so a time, at
least in this problem

85
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,966
that we're dealing
with, we should only

86
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,090
think about positive times.

87
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,224
We want to figure out
how much time has taken--

88
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,432
how long does it take for
the ball to hit the ground?

89
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,890
We don't want to
go back in time.

90
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,891
So we don't want our
negative answer right here.

91
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,470
So we only want to think
about our positive answer.

92
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,820
And so this tells us that the
only root that should work

93
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,010
is 5/2.

94
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,140
And we assume that
this is in seconds.

95
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,930
So this is in 5/2 seconds.

96
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,969
I wouldn't worry too much
about the physics here.

97
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,600
I think they really just want us
to apply the quadratic formula

98
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:24,885
to this modeling situation.

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,630
The physics, we go
into a lot more depth

100
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,730
and give you the conceptual
understanding on our physics

101
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,530
playlist.

102
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,590
But let's verify that we
definitely are at a height of 0

103
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,620
at 5/2 seconds, or
t is equal to 5/2.

104
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,540
This expression right over here
does give us h is equal to 0.

105
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,160
So we have-- let's try it out.

106
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,830
We have negative 16
times 5/2 squared

107
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,820
plus 20 times 5/2 plus 50.

108
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,420
This needs to be equal to 0.

109
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,010
So this is negative
16 times 25/4 plus--

110
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,925
let's see, if we divide
20 by 2, we get 10.

111
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,260
If we divide 2 by 2, we get 1.

112
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,120
So 10 times 5 is going to be 50.

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,460
Plus 50.

114
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,610
This needs to be equal to 0.

115
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,700
Negative 16 divided
by 4 is negative 4.

116
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,350
4 divided by 4 is 1.

117
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,650
So you have negative 4
times 25, which is 100.

118
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,680
Plus 50-- oh, sorry.

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,880
Negative 4 times
25 is negative 100.

120
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,780
Plus 50, plus 50
again is equal to 0.

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,970
And so we have negative
100 plus another 100.

122
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:38,932
Well, that's definitely
going to be equal to 0.

123
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,370
We get 0 equals 0.

124
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,950
And it all checks out.

125
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,320
We hit the ground
after 5/2 seconds.

126
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,090
Or another way to think
about it is 2.5 seconds.

127
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,930
t is equal to 5/2
seconds, or 2.5 seconds.

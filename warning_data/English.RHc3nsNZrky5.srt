1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,110
Solve for p.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:08,000
We have the absolute value of p minus 12
plus 4 is less than 14.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,170
So, let's just do this one step at a time.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,450
The first thing we wanna do is we really

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,980
just wanna isolate the part that has the
absolute value.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,930
So, to do that we can just get rid of this
positive 4 here.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,840
We can do that by subtracting 4 from both
sides of the inequality.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,860
And so the left hand side the positive 4
and the negative 4

9
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:33,588
cancel out we're just left with the
absolute value of p minus 12.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,630
And on the right hand side it, we get 14
minus

11
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:40,292
4 is 10 and we still have the less than
sign.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,910
So we have the absolute value of p minus
12 is less than 10.

13
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:46,438
So let's just think about it a little bit.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,990
If I were to tell you, if I were to tell
you that

15
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:52,946
the absolute value of x is less than 10
what does that mean?

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,750
That means that the distance from x to 0
has to be less than 10.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,730
So if I were to draw a number line, if I
were to draw a number

18
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:06,664
line and put 0 here we can only go up 10
away and even that's too far.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,170
It has to be less than 10.

20
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,338
So if this is positive 10 it would have to

21
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:13,378
be less than positive 10 cuz 10 is exactly
10 away.

22
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,711
We have to be less than 10 away from 0.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,970
And then we could go all the way to the
left until negative 10

24
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:24,434
and even that we wouldn't be able to
include because its absolute value is 10.

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,340
It's not less than 10 but negative 9

26
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:29,284
negative 9.999 we could include all of
those things.

27
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:33,612
The absolute value of any of those things
is gonna be less than 10.

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,760
So another way to write this, this
absolute value inequality

29
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:43,708
is that x could be, x could be greater
than negative 10, x

30
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,968
could be greater than negative 10 and x
needs to be

31
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:52,175
less than 10 or we can write this as x is
between.

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,080
So negative 10 is kinda the bottom

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,420
boundary and we're not going to include
it.

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,450
X is going to be greater than that and is
less than 10.

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,500
So this is another way to write the
absolute value of x is less than 10.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,010
Is essentially saying that x has to be
between negative 10

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,930
and 10 and it can't be either negative 10
or 10.

38
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,080
We're not, there's no equals sign here.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
So, the same exact logic.

40
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:16,337
Instead of an x we have a p minus 12 here.

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,440
So, we can write the absolute value of p
minus 12 is less than 10 is

42
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:27,024
saying that negative 10 is less than p
minus 12 which is less than 10.

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,380
And we can just solve this compound
inequality all

44
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,100
at once by isolating the p in the middle.

45
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:35,313
The best way to isolate the p in the

46
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:38,455
middle we wanna get rid of this negative
12.

47
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,549
So let's add 12 to all three, all three
sections of this compound inequality.

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,370
And so we get negative 10 plus 12 is
positive 2.

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,620
And then is less than p minus 12 plus 12
is just p.

50
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,480
And then is less than 10 plus 12 is 22.

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,250
So p is greater than 2 and less than 22.

52
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,710
So if we were to plot it on a number line
our solution set looks like this.

53
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,510
So this might be 2 over here.

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,350
This might be 22 over here maybe 0 sitting
right over here.

55
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,620
P is greater than 2.

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,710
P is greater than 2.

57
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,060
It's not greater than or equal to so we
have to not fill this in.

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,920
It has to be an open circle it's only
greater than and it's less than 22.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,390
It's not less than or equal to so we're
not gonna fill that circle in.

60
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,470
And it's everything, it's everything in
between.

61
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,510
And we can verify it for ourselves.

62
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,690
Let's try a value that might work out
well.

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,490
Well, 12 is in between these two numbers.

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,170
It's in our magenta region right here.

65
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,780
So let's try p is equal to 12.

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,190
So if you have 12 minus 12.

67
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,720
So it's the absolute value of 12 minus 12
plus 4 which should be less than 14.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,140
So this is 0 plus 4 which needs to be less
than 14 and 4 is definitely less than 14.

69
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,150
So 12 worked 0 shouldn't work.

70
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,210
Lets try 0.

71
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,440
Zero minus 12 so it's the absolute value
of 0.

72
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,900
I wanna do this in a different color.

73
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,230
It is the absolute value of 0 minus 12
plus 4.

74
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,120
This should not be less than 14.

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,160
This should not work.

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,710
So we get the absolute value of negative
12.

77
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,009
Plus 4 should not be less than 14.

78
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:23,245
Then we should end up with a contradiction
here.

79
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,946
So we have 12 plus 4 less than 14 we end

80
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:29,051
up with 16 is less than 14 which is not
true.

81
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:32,902
So 0 does not work so at least we're
feeling pretty good.

82
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,110
We took something outside of our solution
set didn't

83
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,445
work something inside of our solution set
it did work.

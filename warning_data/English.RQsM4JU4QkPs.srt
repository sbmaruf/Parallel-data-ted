1
00:01:55,876 --> 00:02:42,924
Honey~!

2
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:45,159
Hey, you can't kick that...

3
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,729
Jeez...

4
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,232
You haven't changed one bit.

5
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:52,099
Oh it's you, Boeun.

6
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:58,238
You're a big girl now. Great body!

7
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,074
Nice curves.

8
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:04,414
Drop it, okay?

9
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:05,913
Hey, you little girl!

10
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:09,083
Hey, give me a break!

11
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,120
They look so nice and shiny...

12
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,157
Stop staring. You'll sprain your eyes.

13
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:24,965
No, it's just that they look familiar.

14
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:27,468
Anyway, what brings you here?

15
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,572
Did you miss me so much that you had to skip school?

16
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,574
No, it's the school's anniversary.

17
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:36,244
I was forced to come here.

18
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:38,513
I'm wasting my time when I really have to study.

19
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:42,450
Yeah, there's only 2 years left till the national exam.

20
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,123
But people like you really make college look undesirable.

21
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:50,093
What do you mean?

22
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,827
You're a pervert and a playboy.

23
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:58,333
I may be a playboy, but I'm not a pervert.

24
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,368
Here's your present.

25
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:03,505
It's just for you! Keep it a secret to the family.

26
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:06,007
Okay.

27
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:09,344
Pretty, isn't it? It's padded. Real thick.

28
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,178
You're a pervert!

29
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:12,913
Should I help you put it on?

30
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:36,205
- Should I?- Do you want me to punch you?

31
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:41,911
- My son! My son's home!- How have you been?

32
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,912
- Welcome home.- Thanks.

33
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:47,984
- How was your trip?- Fine. How have you been?

34
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,584
- Grandfather's waiting. Hurry.- Okay.

35
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:55,758
- Mom, it's heavy. I'll carry it.- Okay.

36
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:58,660
You've changed.

37
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,032
What was all the rush for? And is grandpa really sick?

38
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:17,646
Son, brace yourself, okay?

39
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:19,414
Delicious, isn't it?

40
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:22,386
I made it myself, just for you, grandfather.

41
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,619
Really tasty.

42
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:29,257
No one but you can take such good care of me.

43
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:32,595
Of course, I'm your only granddaughter.

44
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:36,832
You've really grown. Now you look like a lady.

45
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:39,534
She may have grown, but she's still a child.

46
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:43,738
I'd be married in the old days.

47
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:45,541
Right grandfather?

48
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,778
Absolutely. A married woman.

49
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:54,718
- Sangmin, come sit here.- Yes, grandfather.

50
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:59,655
You two, hear me out.

51
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:04,393
You may have heard this story before...

52
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:11,400
Sangmin's grandfather wasan old friend and war comrade

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,706
When we were young, we made a pact,

54
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:19,776
To marry our kids.

55
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:23,612
But you two had only sons.

56
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:28,185
So, our pact was passed down to the next generation.

57
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,956
I hope you two can keep this promise.

58
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:36,492
What are you saying?

59
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:42,297
You idiot! Grandpa wants you to marry Sangmin!

60
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:45,202
Marriage?

61
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,437
You must be joking grandpa!

62
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:51,440
Marry Sangmin?

63
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,577
Hey! Your grandpa's not kidding!

64
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:58,282
I can die peacefully after you two get married!

65
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:02,385
This way, I can face Sangmin's grandpa.

66
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:08,456
How can a high schooler get married!

67
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:15,597
Anyone over 15 can marry withtheir parent's consent.

68
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:19,636
I haven't much time left, you know?

69
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:21,671
No, I won't.

70
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:26,945
Never!

71
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:33,383
Sorry grandpa but I'll forget what you just said.

72
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:52,970
He hasn't finished speaking!

73
00:07:52,970 --> 00:08:00,876
I'm speechless myself.

74
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:05,550
It's me. I'm back.

75
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,849
I'm back in Korea,standing in front of the department office.

76
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,220
Hey, there's lots of new blood in the department

77
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,992
- How are you?- Oh, yeah.

78
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:19,129
The chicks are great!Let's get together after class.

79
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,598
Hey, Sangmin!

80
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:24,936
What a surprise!

81
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,902
Has it been a year already?

82
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,539
No, I'm back for some family business.

83
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,243
How about you?

84
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:36,580
Great. My looks...

85
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,182
- keep me too busy...- Come on...

86
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:43,887
Come back when I'm the TA.It'll help when you skip classes.

87
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:48,958
Would I, a model student, do that?

88
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,296
Besides, it's my last year...

89
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:56,633
Friend, my good friend!

90
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,504
- How have you been!- Great dude!

91
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:02,139
Look at him! Life in the West has done you well!

92
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,808
What brought you back?Problems at home?

93
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:09,212
- Yeah something's up at home...- Huh? What?

94
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,382
- I'm getting married... damn.- Huh? Bastard!

95
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:14,584
Hey, is it a black or white girl?

96
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:18,390
Pounding!

97
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,326
Only you should know about it~

98
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:26,430
I'm just 17~

99
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,333
Come, come silently ~

100
00:09:30,333 --> 00:10:10,976
Here and there~

101
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,776
Hey!

102
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:16,247
They're making such a fuss.Losers...

103
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:31,629
- Shh! They'll hear you.- Why? Do you think you're different?

104
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,933
My doctor said I have 20 more years to go!

105
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:38,101
Really?

106
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:44,341
Change of plans.I'll make my move. Just back me up.

107
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:51,716
I understand.

108
00:10:51,716 --> 00:11:19,309
Good!

109
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,847
They switched it.

110
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:31,155
Isn't he the guy?

111
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:33,859
They switched it. Remember?

112
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,228
Yeah...

113
00:11:36,228 --> 00:12:11,662
I really wish they wouldn't play those things on TV.

114
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:15,401
I guess the wedding's really on.

115
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:35,855
What am I going to do, mom?

116
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,923
Be strong, son.

117
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:54,273
Grant your grandpa this one wish.

118
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:59,177
Let's call it a day!

119
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:12,158
You're Suh Boeun, 1st grade, right?

120
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:16,126
You were so funny, don't you agree?

121
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,896
Hey, what?

122
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:24,168
Come on!

123
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:25,738
Who's he?

124
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,674
He's just a guy I know.

125
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,509
That's what they all say.

126
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:38,183
I'm telling the truth!

127
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:42,988
I really thought about it,

128
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,893
and I'll speak first.

129
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,862
- Let's just do it.- Are you crazy?

130
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:54,933
I'm kidding.

131
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,837
Do you think I'd want to?

132
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,972
I don't want to do it with you!

133
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,572
Even if I did,

134
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:05,010
it's insane. I'm just 15!

135
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,180
Okay, I got it.

136
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,450
Anyway, I'll buy you dinner.

137
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,818
Or anything else you need.

138
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,887
Mister, you're a sugar daddy, aren't you?

139
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,823
- Boeun.- Huh?

140
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,361
How can you do this to me?

141
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,829
I may be pretty, but

142
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:29,535
something like this...

143
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,870
Hey...

144
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:46,587
Hyewon, stop it!

145
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:50,323
- I'll leave you two to talk.- Huh?

146
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,858
See you later, Boeun.

147
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,927
- Remember, it's a secret.- I know.

148
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,031
- Bye.- Good bye.

149
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:05,406
- What's her problem?- It's understandable.

150
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:09,875
Hello? Yes...

151
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:22,488
What!

152
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,392
Good, good.

153
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,460
Grandpa!

154
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,262
- Grandpa!- Grandpa!

155
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,665
Grandpa, we're here!

156
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,499
Grandpa, Grandpa!

157
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,403
Grandpa, Grandpa!Wake up, Grandpa!

158
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:41,106
- Uncle, something's wrong!- What?

159
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,444
Grandpa!

160
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,445
It's doing it again.

161
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,514
We should've gone to another hospital!

162
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:53,617
It almost gave me a heart attack!

163
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:58,525
I was out of myself again.

164
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,527
Are you okay, grandpa?

165
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,198
- Let's have a word outside.- Okay.

166
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,400
Be by your grandpa's side, okay?

167
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,306
Yeah.

168
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,409
I'm really worried.

169
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:19,411
I know. With the kids like that, he's getting worse.

170
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:23,317
Come on... marriage is out of the question!

171
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:32,458
They... you have to think about Boeun's future.

172
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:39,998
Come on, let's just marry the kids.

173
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,535
Let go.

174
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,471
Come on...

175
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:49,978
This is Sangmin's grandparents.

176
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:55,984
Soon after this picture was taken, war broke out.

177
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,685
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

178
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,522
Secretly,

179
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:08,630
your grandpa had feelings for Sangmin's grandma.

180
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,366
She was quite a beauty.

181
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:15,068
However, after Sangmin's grandpa's death,

182
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,039
I tucked those feelings away.

183
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,810
That's why I took care ofSangmin's father like my own son.

184
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,750
Your father may not have been so happy about this.

185
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,851
- Boeun!- Yes?

186
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:38,491
Keeping this promise isthe most important thing for me.

187
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:45,532
- Grandpa!- Grandpa!

188
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,169
Grandpa, wake up. Grandpa!

189
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,804
You can't die!

190
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,373
Open your eyes, grandpa!

191
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:58,579
Grandpa, I'll get married so open your eyes, grandpa!

192
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:03,685
I'll keep your promise, grandpa!

193
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:10,427
I'll get married...

194
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,960
Are you crying?

195
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,063
Stop crying.

196
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,631
You may be behind in your grades,

197
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,967
but you're the nation's first to get married at this age.

198
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,269
Congrats, missus.

199
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,637
Right.

200
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:26,406
Are you scared that Sangminwill discover your lop-sided butt?

201
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:32,113
A butt that needs cushioningto keep it on balance?

202
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:39,420
- Hey, get out!- Ouch, it hurts!

203
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,124
I'm sorry Boeun, for not being much help.

204
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:52,500
Mom, am I really getting married?

205
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,837
What about school?

206
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:58,839
I have to go to college...

207
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,442
Marriage won't change anything.

208
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:04,979
Marriage, accept it with grace. It's nothing.

209
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,917
Just consider you're getting a new brother.

210
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,585
I'm scared that they'll find out at school.

211
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,489
How will I face everyone?

212
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:17,925
Don't worry. Grandpa will take care of it.

213
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:22,464
Your grandpa was your principal's military senior.

214
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:24,798
Really?

215
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,770
Behold the face of a wolfwho'll eat up a 15 year old virgin.

216
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:35,976
- Is it satisfaction or disbelief?- Satisfaction, of course.

217
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:39,682
Shit, are you really my friends?

218
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:43,850
I can't be married at this age.

219
00:19:43,850 --> 00:20:15,218
- To Sangmin!- Cheers~

220
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:20,089
The chicks here are hot!

221
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:37,606
Let's go out on the floor!

222
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:38,806
Hello.

223
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:40,142
You're here. Thanks.

224
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:41,710
You're here.

225
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,782
- Sir!!- Yes, come in. Over here.

226
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:47,249
I won't forget this.

227
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,450
How could our field trip be at the same time?

228
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,653
I know.

229
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:55,489
You shouldn't keep it from your other friends.

230
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:59,128
If they found out,the whole school will know.

231
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:03,297
Then I'd have to quit school.

232
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:06,936
Anyway, you're so pretty today.I wish I could get married too.

233
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:08,604
Look here!

234
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:11,040
Hey, smile!

235
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,207
- How are you doing?- Hello.

236
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,777
- Don't take my picture.- Okay, okay.

237
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:17,346
Good luck!

238
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:21,549
I'm convinced that grandpa scammed me.

239
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:27,955
- Boeun, it's just a wedding, okay?- I can't do it, mom!

240
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,392
Now, don't be a baby.

241
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:32,861
I'm nervous myself.

242
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:35,665
I'm telling grandpa, "I can't do it!".

243
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:40,170
Do you want your wedding turned into a funeral?

244
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,672
I don't know.

245
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:45,541
I'm scared, mom.

246
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:52,115
What am I going to do with such a baby?

247
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:54,349
Now the groom will enter.Welcome him with a big applause.

248
00:21:54,349 --> 00:22:03,425
The groom, please enter!

249
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:26,249
She's so beautiful!

250
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:29,017
Respectable guests,

251
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:32,555
family and relatives.

252
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:35,456
We are all gathered here tocongradulate the new beginning of

253
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:38,295
groom, Park Sangmin

254
00:22:38,295 --> 00:23:15,331
and bride, Suh Boeun...

255
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:25,108
- Dad, we'll be okay.- Yeah, yeah.

256
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:29,378
Remember, she's only 15.

257
00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:32,915
- What's your point?- I know I can trust you.

258
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,350
You forced me into this marriage, so I'll do as I wish!

259
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,221
Boeun is still in high school!

260
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:41,690
I don't care! I'll do as I wish with my wife.

261
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,830
Boeun, don't worry.Your father-in-law has had a word with Sangmin.

262
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,966
About what?

263
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:55,505
- That you... shouldn't do it...- What?

264
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:57,741
I can't say...

265
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:02,511
- Call us when you get there.- Yes, auntie.

266
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:06,449
Stop calling her that. It's mom from now on.

267
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,786
Yes, mom.

268
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:12,354
Hey, mom! Can I keep the bouquet?

269
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:14,057
It was so pretty...

270
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:15,626
Forget the bouquet...

271
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,896
She's such a child.

272
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:21,931
What am I going to do with you?

273
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:25,468
Stop, you promised to be cool.

274
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:28,371
- Bon voyage~- Yes, yes...

275
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:35,946
- Bye~- Follow right behind, okay?

276
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:38,748
It's time to board, where is she?

277
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:40,049
Boeun.

278
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,019
- Boeun? Where is it?- Over there...

279
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,587
- Okay, we'll go inside, thanks.- Okay, go.

280
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:49,425
- Thanks for everything.- Don't overdo yourself.

281
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:51,894
- Have a safe trip.- Yeah, give me the suitcase.

282
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,830
Have fun, Boeun.

283
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,601
Don't worry, dude.Be good, okay?

284
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,970
- See you later!- Bye. Bon voyage.

285
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,239
- I've never boarded on time...- Wait.

286
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,639
- What?- I need to go to the bathroom.

287
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:08,245
Again? It's your first time on a plane, isn't it?

288
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:11,948
Don't worry. It's only an hour to Jeju Isle.

289
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,983
It won't take long.

290
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:17,022
You're making such a fuss. Hurry back.

291
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:24,394
- I'll be at our seats. Hurry.- Okay...

292
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:35,339
Shit. Where is she?

293
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,377
- Sir, you must be seated.- The plane's leaving. Open the...

294
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:46,651
Sir, please seat yourself!

295
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:53,323
Mobiles are prohibited in the cabin.Thank you for your cooperation.

296
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:55,160
He must think he owns the plane.

297
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:03,434
It must be his first flight.

298
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:19,517
I don't believe this.

299
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:24,388
Wait sir.

300
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:26,156
- We're in a hurry.- Sorry.

301
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:32,197
Hey!

302
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:36,566
Did they arrive safely?

303
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:42,373
Yeah... they did.

304
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:46,244
I need to be clear about one thing.Listen!

305
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:51,515
Until Boeun graduates from college, no grandchildren!

306
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:54,418
Make this clear to your father as well.

307
00:26:54,418 --> 00:27:02,093
Yes, of course.

308
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:08,199
When she was little,she would fall and break things,

309
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:11,401
but she seemed to holdherself well at the wedding.

310
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,706
It's a relief.

311
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:16,473
Why? Are you disappointed that she didn't fall?

312
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:19,677
Yes, a little.

313
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:57,982
Come on...

314
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:17,635
Not those idiots again!

315
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:19,137
Having fun?

316
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:36,654
Hey!

317
00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:44,730
Hey, do you have a place to stay?

318
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,299
Just this once.

319
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,369
Press anything. Wind it and press.

320
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,137
Say cheese.

321
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:53,240
Take your best shot.

322
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,973
Uh, Sangmin?

323
00:28:55,973 --> 00:29:02,747
I can't believe this!

324
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:05,851
What brings you here?

325
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:09,053
Boeun's on her honeymoonand we're on our fieldtrip.

326
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:11,491
- Don't you remember?- Of course I do.

327
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,125
- Where's Boeun?- Well...

328
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,561
- Hey! Who's the mister?- He's just a friend.

329
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,364
- He's cute.- See you later!

330
00:29:18,364 --> 00:29:22,533
- Hey, stop it. Wait, come here.- Oh god...

331
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,502
Hey!

332
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:29,073
What are you doing on top of her!

333
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:32,544
You pervert! You chase after young girls,don't you!

334
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,178
It's not like that.

335
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:35,981
- I'm not...- Really.

336
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:38,251
- Really?- Really.

337
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,151
Then what are you doing?

338
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:41,485
- Uh?- Huh?

339
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:59,239
Look at him running off!

340
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:02,308
Aren't you supposed to be on your field trip?

341
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:17,323
Yes...

342
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:27,164
Then why are you here?

343
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:29,735
What are you doing today?

344
00:30:29,735 --> 00:31:05,571
Nothing.

345
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:08,841
Do you have a boyfriend?

346
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:25,958
No...I don't.

347
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:30,965
The cell phone you are tring to reach is off.You will be transferred to a voice mail...

348
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:35,834
Pest, how can you do this to me...

349
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:58,123
Our parents shouldn't find out.We'll talk later. Bye.

350
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:00,526
Then, from now on we're dating.

351
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:01,928
Okay!

352
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:21,647
Hey you! Come here!

353
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:27,320
Wow! Looks so fun! Isn't it?

354
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,055
- Where are you from?- I'm from Canada.

355
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:32,224
Canada? I know Canada!

356
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:35,796
Who am I kidding?I've never set foot on Canada.

357
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:40,266
Teacher!

358
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,036
Teacher!

359
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:46,205
Hi, how are you?

360
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:48,776
Uh, Hyewon?

361
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:54,347
What brings you here at this hour?

362
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,116
It's free time for us.

363
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:58,350
Haven't you ever been on a field trip?

364
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,821
Of course I have.

365
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:06,025
Anyway, where's Boeun? Why are you alone?

366
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,629
I don't even know where to begin?It's like this...

367
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:10,162
Yes.

368
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:12,665
Boeun...

369
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:20,941
You're a serial pervert, aren't you!

370
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:25,078
Hey! Come back!

371
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:26,814
Feels good, doesn't it?

372
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:32,185
It's been a while... together. Sit here.

373
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:33,453
Stop.

374
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,389
Rest your back on this.

375
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,128
I feel great.

376
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:44,732
It's too late for this

377
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,970
but I'm sure that we did a horrible thing to Boeun.

378
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,805
She's only 15, and going through her 1st year of high school.

379
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:56,775
Come on! Be more positive.

380
00:33:56,775 --> 00:34:01,683
You were considering him as your son-in-law anyway.

381
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:05,018
She's not going far away.Let's have some faith, okay?

382
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:10,023
Besides, our in-laws love Boeunlike their own daughter.

383
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:13,294
But, she's not their own daughter.

384
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:16,596
I can understand dad and you,

385
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,298
but I still can't forgive you for it.

386
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:21,335
Okay, okay, that's enough... enough...

387
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:40,722
Without Boeun,it seems like there's a big hole in my heart.

388
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:45,859
Everyone looks like Boeun, that one too...

389
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:55,469
Candy, sir? Thank you.

390
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:54,093
Candy, sir?

391
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:56,096
Boeun, help him.

392
00:35:56,096 --> 00:36:00,801
Honey, honey, here.

393
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:02,369
Thank you very much.

394
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:10,244
- Grandpa!- Dad, come on out.

395
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:14,580
- Sit, sit and eat.- Okay.

396
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,119
So, how was your trip?

397
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,956
Good grandpa. We had a good time.

398
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:27,795
Yes, Sangmin was kind to me. I really had fun.

399
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:31,966
Stop, I didn't do anything.

400
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:34,368
I'm glad you had fun.

401
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:36,036
Since you're officially married,

402
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:42,778
love one another so we can seethe fruit of your love.

403
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:45,614
But you don't look so happy, Sangmin.

404
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:47,848
Are you sick?

405
00:36:47,848 --> 00:36:51,353
Of course I'm not sick.

406
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:55,956
They're definitely a great couple,aren't they?

407
00:36:55,956 --> 00:36:58,660
Your room's been cleaned,so go get some rest.

408
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,827
Yes sir.

409
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,263
Stop, we should have a drink with the new groom.

410
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,532
How about it dad?

411
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:07,669
Right. My grandson-in-law should pour me a drink.

412
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:19,215
As you wish.

413
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:21,148
Grandpa, I'll go to bed now.

414
00:37:21,148 --> 00:37:26,821
Yeah, yeah.Go to your room...

415
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:29,791
Careful!

416
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,261
Honey!

417
00:37:32,261 --> 00:37:34,964
Let's go!

418
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:38,200
- Hey! Boeun's not a thing.- Good night!

419
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,368
Hey! Be careful.

420
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:45,041
Hey! Hey!

421
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:49,944
- Have a good night.- Good night!

422
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:59,019
Honey!

423
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:03,225
Ah, you're heavy!

424
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:05,459
And you stink of liquor!

425
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:17,072
Hey! Hey!

426
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:22,813
- You're tearing my dress. Stop it!- Keep still!

427
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:26,448
He's coming on real strong.

428
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:31,021
This is the right place.Come in. Look at this tree.

429
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:33,855
Come in dad. Close the door behind you.

430
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,157
What do you think? Huh? It's nice right?

431
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,494
Look at this, great isn't it?

432
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:41,664
It's a great place.

433
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,933
Great place Boeun.

434
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:48,537
- Hey, you put up that picture!- Nice, isn't it? Great huh?

435
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:51,573
Look at the balcony. I chose this.

436
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:53,140
Boeun.

437
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,211
It's so clean.

438
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:58,346
Hey, look at this picture.This picture.

439
00:38:58,346 --> 00:39:01,082
Where should I put this picture?

440
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:03,787
You're having the time of your life,aren't you?

441
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:07,289
- What's this, Arabian Nights?- Goodness!

442
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:10,193
- What's with the pillows...- Goodness...

443
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:13,395
Separate rooms until you graduate, okay?

444
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:20,970
I am so pissed!

445
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,138
I like it...

446
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:30,045
What's this, a flower garden?

447
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:35,752
What am I going to do?

448
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:40,389
Stop it!

449
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:44,325
Language is part of culture...

450
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:48,565
Language is... a part of... culture...

451
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:55,438
When we learn of foreign languages,we should also learn about...

452
00:39:55,438 --> 00:40:05,513
that country's culture...

453
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:08,985
Ah, great!

454
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:13,555
Hey, stop! Put something on!

455
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:18,728
I always take everything off.Even my underwear.

456
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:23,033
Get out!

457
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:25,668
Out where?

458
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:27,837
This is my room.

459
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:30,171
What do you mean?

460
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:34,344
This is my room. Yours is over there.

461
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,946
Get out!

462
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:41,618
I don't feel like it.

463
00:40:41,618 --> 00:40:43,820
Let's sleep together.

464
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:49,991
What, you're crazy!

465
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,130
You sleep together when you get married.

466
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,733
Boeun...

467
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:58,834
What?

468
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:02,073
- I think tonight is the night.- What?

469
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:04,240
Listen to me.

470
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,743
Stay away from me.

471
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:10,279
Come on. We're married.Boeun, do as I say!

472
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,480
Hey, stop it!

473
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:28,499
We're married! Do as I say and stay still.

474
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:40,110
Shit... I was just playing with you!

475
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,977
Oh my god!

476
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:44,914
Good morning, Boeun.

477
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:48,851
Your eyes are quite a sight!

478
00:41:48,851 --> 00:42:09,505
Morning exercise?

479
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:12,611
What? You disappeared from the airport?

480
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:14,413
Then what did you doduring your honeymoon?

481
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:19,717
Who, me?

482
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,517
Can you keep a secret?

483
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:26,222
You have too many secrets.

484
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:28,692
I'm dating Jungwoo.

485
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:31,662
Jungwoo? What about your husband?

486
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:34,864
Husband... are you kidding?I was forced into it.

487
00:42:34,864 --> 00:42:37,335
Then does Jungwoo know you're married?

488
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:42,805
No. But I'm sure he'll understand.

489
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:54,717
Let's go.

490
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:59,523
If I call her, she'll be here in an instant.

491
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:02,993
Are you sure she'll come if you call her now?

492
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:07,529
Of course. She'll say"Yes master" and then come.

493
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:12,703
You're such a liar.

494
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:14,672
Stop, she'll be studying anyway.

495
00:43:14,672 --> 00:43:17,208
- Wait. I'll show you.- Dude, that's impolite.

496
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:21,044
- Tell her to come.- Wait.

497
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:26,050
Wife! It's me!

498
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,250
Your husband commands you to come!

499
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,686
Wow.

500
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:32,456
- Hurry!- Wow.

501
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,659
- Hurry!!- Wow.

502
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:37,027
Bye!

503
00:43:37,027 --> 00:43:39,331
Now she'll fly here like a bullet.

504
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:44,402
Guys... let's drink!

505
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:47,771
I'm Sangmin. I'm a man, ain't I?

506
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,172
Of course you're a man.

507
00:43:49,172 --> 00:43:54,077
I'm just teaching my wife a lesson, like a real man!

508
00:43:54,077 --> 00:43:57,682
A man of all men. A real man.Have a drink, men!

509
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:59,850
Men!! Men, drink up!

510
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,352
Drink till we drop!

511
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:04,356
There'll be an inspection today.Go home and study.

512
00:44:04,356 --> 00:44:06,590
Wife!

513
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:09,060
She's my wife. Come here wife!

514
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,497
- We're married!- Not today.

515
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:15,199
He's really her husband.

516
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,237
Welcome, Boeun.

517
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:21,939
You saw her at the wedding, my wife, Boeun.

518
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:25,545
How could you call me over to such a place...

519
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:27,878
like this?

520
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:31,716
Your husband says it's okay.

521
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,118
Another beer please!

522
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:36,487
Don't. Would you like a soda?

523
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:37,856
Yes...

524
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:40,290
A soda over here.

525
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,361
You're so adorable.

526
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:44,996
Thank you.

527
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:48,799
Of course! My wife's adorable.

528
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,437
She's a horrible cook, with a bad temper.

529
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:52,636
And a bad student.

530
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:55,775
- She also snores.- Sangmin! You're drunk.

531
00:44:55,775 --> 00:44:57,475
- Stop drinking, okay?- No.

532
00:44:57,475 --> 00:45:00,711
I'm jealous. I have no one to worry about me.

533
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:04,016
- Wow, I feel great. Bottoms up!- Bottoms up, bottoms up!

534
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:09,254
I never introduced myself.I'm Sangmin's senior, Han Jisoo.

535
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:12,022
I'm Suh Boeun.

536
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:15,460
Boing, boing, Boeun.

537
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,697
She goes boing boing every morning!

538
00:45:17,697 --> 00:45:21,899
Jisoo, do you know what she didto me on our honeymoon?

539
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:27,272
Hey, Park Sangmin! Get off your butt!

540
00:45:27,272 --> 00:45:33,644
Pretty please...

541
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:37,117
I'll see you again, Jisoo.

542
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:39,451
Yes. I'm sure we'll be good friends.

543
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:41,754
Treat me like a little sister.

544
00:45:41,754 --> 00:45:46,190
But you're my senior in lifesince you're married.

545
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,126
Stop joking.

546
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:50,495
Stop joking, stop joking.

547
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:54,166
You know, you two are made for each other.

548
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:58,536
We were always at each other's throatswhen we were little.

549
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:01,339
Hitting and teasing each other.

550
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,709
He's the first boy to flip my skirt.

551
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:09,781
Funny. Boys are mean to girlsthey really like.

552
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:29,536
Jisoo, Jisoo, kiss me.

553
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:34,239
At least you could've fixed mesomething for my hangover.

554
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,541
You deserve it.

555
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:39,578
Besides, I'm still in high school.

556
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:41,747
You always use that line when you're cornered.

557
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:43,316
High school is not a crown, you know.

558
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:47,486
It is too, so there!

559
00:46:47,486 --> 00:47:05,104
Okay, then I'll show you my cooking talents tonight!

560
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:07,139
- Hey, Suh Boeun!- What?

561
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:08,442
- Let's go.- Come.

562
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:16,881
Do you wanna get smacked? Come!

563
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:18,349
What do you want?

564
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:22,122
I heard you were telling everyoneyou were Jungwoo's girl?

565
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:24,456
Fucking unbelievable!

566
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:31,297
She's boasting that she's slept with Jungwoo.

567
00:47:31,297 --> 00:47:37,470
The bitch thinks we're shit.How dare you, bitch!

568
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,539
Listen up. Watch your mouth.

569
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:45,210
If I hear about this again,you're dead meat!

570
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,682
Jungwoo and I are in love!

571
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:52,752
Have you lost your senses!

572
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:55,122
Hey! Didn't you get the message?

573
00:47:55,122 --> 00:48:00,560
I didn't do anything wrong. I'm leaving!

574
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,830
Hey! How dare you...Lose your attitude!

575
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:20,947
What are you doing!

576
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:22,982
Fuck off.

577
00:48:22,982 --> 00:48:24,483
What?

578
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:27,587
Hey, Lee Jungwoo,you can't treat me like that!

579
00:48:27,587 --> 00:48:30,655
You're in no position to say that to me.

580
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:46,006
Listen up. It's true that Boeun and I are dating.

581
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:53,713
Don't mind them. They think they're princesses.

582
00:48:53,713 --> 00:49:09,262
But you're the real princess.

583
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:13,533
Sesame oil, sugar!

584
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,834
- A small bottle of oil?- Yeah!

585
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:18,104
- This sugar?- Hurry, hurry.

586
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:21,474
Okay!

587
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,809
Vinegar, spaghetti, ketchup!

588
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:26,313
There's the vinegar...

589
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:28,914
And there's the spaghetti!

590
00:49:28,914 --> 00:49:30,217
Here?

591
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,718
Here, the ketchup's here. Okay...

592
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,652
Hurry, hurry!

593
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:42,161
- Olive oil, pickles!- Olive oil, pickles!

594
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:46,868
Boeun!

595
00:49:46,868 --> 00:49:48,034
Are you okay, Boeun?

596
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:55,075
Boeun, Boeun, Are you okay?

597
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,510
Are you okay?

598
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,812
Ow, my leg!

599
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:05,485
It hurts?

600
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:11,392
- Does it hurt bad?- No. Why? Get off?

601
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:19,967
Stay put before I change my mind.

602
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,901
Don't touch me there!

603
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:25,239
I'm not doing it on purpose.Why should I?

604
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,640
My hand just went there naturally.

605
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,880
What a great excuse!Now walk straight.

606
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,383
You slant to the right becauseyour butt is lop-sided.

607
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:38,353
Don't start with me.

608
00:50:38,353 --> 00:50:39,955
I'm not kidding.

609
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:42,622
Your right butt has grown bigger.

610
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,658
Hey, stop it!

611
00:50:44,658 --> 00:50:47,660
Stop it! Hey, stop it!

612
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,665
Lop-sided butt~Lop-sided butt~

613
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:52,533
- Stop it, stop it!- Okay, okay!

614
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:55,168
- Ladies and gentlemen!- Shut up...

615
00:50:55,168 --> 00:50:57,171
Boeun has a lop-sided butt!

616
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:59,407
Lop-sided butt~

617
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:00,807
Look at how you're cutting.

618
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:04,346
You should put your heart intowhat you're cooking.

619
00:51:04,346 --> 00:51:05,746
Just be quiet!

620
00:51:05,746 --> 00:51:07,880
- Be quiet? I'm older than you...- Stop it!

621
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,116
Stop what? I'm older...Hey... You little...

622
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,952
- What?- Take my sword.

623
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:14,789
- Pest... aim at what you can take.- Hey, come here.

624
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:20,559
What are you going to do with that?

625
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,834
- Hey, stop it... it’s hot. Hot! Hey...- Hey...

626
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,501
Hey... that's not fair!

627
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:34,207
Ouch!

628
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:39,914
- It's delicious.- Yeah.

629
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:42,550
You got something on your mouth.

630
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:44,886
The same with you.

631
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:48,589
Rock, paper, scissors!Rock, paper, scissors!

632
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:50,158
Yes!

633
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:54,260
Make sure everything's spotless.It's more important than cooking.

634
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,464
Give me a break!

635
00:51:56,464 --> 00:51:59,833
Hey, is it this side?

636
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:18,918
Hey! You pervert! If I were you, I would help!

637
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:22,790
This picture's great. I look so handsome.

638
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:36,204
Gotcha!

639
00:52:36,204 --> 00:52:42,144
Sangmin... Don't come near me!

640
00:52:42,144 --> 00:52:45,612
Stop it!

641
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:48,349
Don't come near me! Stop it, stop...

642
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:57,759
- Now, I'm taking everything off!- Stop!

643
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:02,998
- Thanks, the sushi's great.- Really?

644
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:07,401
The baseball field's empty.Aren't people coming to watch the game?

645
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,471
No one comes to watchhigh school baseball anymore.

646
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:12,373
It's pro- baseball or the major leaguethat they go to.

647
00:53:12,373 --> 00:53:17,113
I hope you'll play in themajor league some day.

648
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,448
Hey, Lee Jungwoo!

649
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:30,258
Good luck!

650
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:40,569
I'm starved.

651
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:49,177
Double crust seafood...

652
00:53:49,177 --> 00:54:00,054
This is pretty good.

653
00:54:00,054 --> 00:54:04,125
Lee Jungwoo, hurrah~

654
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:10,263
Give us a break.Great pitching and now good batting?

655
00:54:10,263 --> 00:54:17,204
She's quite a chick.Why don't you share? Shit.

656
00:54:17,204 --> 00:54:19,674
Yes, that player's Lee Jungwoo.An upcoming star in high school baseball!

657
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:24,311
Huh? It's Boeun's high school.

658
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:27,550
Was I too generous?That's doesn't look good...

659
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,686
Youngsters with raging hormones.Something to do without.

660
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:38,860
But, I guess they'll grow out of it.

661
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,663
One cute student is quite passionate about a player.

662
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,833
- Ah, it's the sushi girl.- Excuse me?

663
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:49,106
They were sharing a sushi lunch before the game.Nice picture.

664
00:54:49,106 --> 00:55:08,324
I see.

665
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:11,092
Can't you be more early?

666
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:14,263
- Were you still up?- I've been waiting for you.

667
00:55:14,263 --> 00:55:16,464
It gets dangerous at night. Go to bed.

668
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:17,833
Okay.

669
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:18,899
- Sleep.- Go to sleep.

670
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:50,900
- Yeah.- Night.

671
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,972
- What's wrong?- Don't you know?

672
00:55:54,972 --> 00:55:56,771
What?

673
00:55:56,771 --> 00:56:04,212
The whole school knowsabout you and Jungwoo.

674
00:56:04,212 --> 00:56:08,582
- What's wrong with that?- Do you think it's right?

675
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:12,154
You're married.

676
00:56:12,154 --> 00:56:17,159
Just by law! You know how things are!

677
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:34,776
What if Sangmin's parents and your's find out about this?How can you be so selfish?

678
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:38,481
Why are you crying?

679
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:56,532
I like Jungwoo too!

680
00:56:56,532 --> 00:57:01,504
There you are.We're having a meeting at our place tonight.

681
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:02,706
I know.

682
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:06,777
You look great.Your hubby must be treating you well.

683
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:08,810
- Hey!- Yes?

684
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,215
- You live in apt. 106, right?- Yes

685
00:57:12,215 --> 00:57:17,553
There's an important meeting tonight,so tell your mom to come, okay?

686
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:22,765
- It's apt. 108.- Okay.

687
00:57:22,765 --> 00:57:24,633
- Hey!- Yes?

688
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:28,303
You're such a cute little thing.

689
00:57:28,303 --> 00:57:34,977
Thank you.

690
00:57:34,977 --> 00:57:40,915
- Thanks for everything. Bye.- Good night.

691
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:45,221
- Bye. Take care.- Thanks for tonight.

692
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:48,825
Where have you been?

693
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:54,464
Apartment meeting.

694
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:57,567
Look at him.He looks like a sleazebag.

695
00:57:57,567 --> 00:58:00,134
Yeah, he really does.

696
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:05,476
Looks mean as well.

697
00:58:05,476 --> 00:58:11,882
What did you tell them?

698
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:35,939
How can you do this to me!

699
00:58:35,939 --> 00:58:46,715
See you later.

700
00:58:46,715 --> 00:58:51,088
Shit, why am I such a loser.

701
00:58:51,088 --> 00:59:00,229
I envy you.You have a husband and a boyfriend.

702
00:59:00,229 --> 00:59:01,798
Next, next.

703
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:06,069
No. 2, Hulk,No. 3, Tiger Woods,

704
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:08,104
- No. 4 Zidane!- Okay, Zidane!

705
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:09,506
Zidane, Zidane!

706
00:59:09,506 --> 00:59:11,442
What is it?

707
00:59:11,442 --> 00:59:12,907
Aw shit. You should've knocked...

708
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:14,077
- Uh! Jisoo...- Jisoo...

709
00:59:14,077 --> 00:59:18,616
You're here.I have your assigned internship schools.

710
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:21,751
- Sangmin is Dongin High.- What?

711
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:26,489
- Dongin High.- Shit!

712
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:29,192
What is it? What's wrong?

713
00:59:29,192 --> 01:00:00,590
It's Boeun's high school.

714
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:10,769
Idiot!

715
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:12,302
Boeun...

716
01:00:12,302 --> 01:00:13,571
Huh?

717
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:17,007
- You know...- What!?

718
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:23,446
- What is it? I'm late for school!- Okay.

719
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:34,693
We'll talk at home, okay? Bye!

720
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:37,927
Excuse me,but where is the faculty office?

721
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:40,496
Faculty office? I don't know.

722
01:00:40,496 --> 01:00:43,268
I loathe that place.

723
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:48,372
Wait for me!

724
01:00:48,372 --> 01:00:51,140
Hey, who told you to dye your hair?

725
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:56,047
What a funky hairstyle! Come here.

726
01:00:56,047 --> 01:01:02,152
Excuse me!Hey!

727
01:01:02,152 --> 01:01:04,420
Your tea...

728
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,556
Thank you.

729
01:01:06,556 --> 01:01:09,461
You should have told me.

730
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:13,597
You seemed too attractiveto be a pervert.

731
01:01:13,597 --> 01:01:17,568
Working out?

732
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:23,439
Sir, this is the new intern Park Sangmin.

733
01:01:23,439 --> 01:01:25,441
Hello, sir.

734
01:01:25,441 --> 01:01:31,381
Miss. Kim, you may be excused.

735
01:01:31,381 --> 01:01:41,893
Yes, we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

736
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:44,763
- How have you been, sir?- Good.

737
01:01:44,763 --> 01:01:47,165
- Take good care of Boeun.- Yes.

738
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:53,070
- No one knows except for me.- Right.

739
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,372
Last night I was at a disco club...Do you know who I met there?

740
01:01:56,372 --> 01:01:58,475
- Who?- Our room teacher.

741
01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:00,811
What?

742
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:12,222
She must've gone thereto pick up men.

743
01:02:12,222 --> 01:02:26,671
Old maid syndrome!

744
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:28,441
Quiet!

745
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:30,675
We have a new intern here.

746
01:02:30,675 --> 01:02:32,945
- Wow, he's so cute.- He's really cute.

747
01:02:32,945 --> 01:02:34,479
Doesn't he look familiar?

748
01:02:34,479 --> 01:02:39,050
Yeah, he does look familiar.He's cute, though...

749
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:45,123
I'm Park Sangmin who will be teaching Art.

750
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:48,527
- I hope we get along.- Yes!

751
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:52,030
Don't even think of playing tricks on Mr. Park, okay?

752
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,232
Yes, ma'am...

753
01:02:54,232 --> 01:03:00,338
You all have a bright future,you know what I mean!

754
01:03:00,338 --> 01:03:04,341
- Anything else?- No, that's all.

755
01:03:04,341 --> 01:03:08,779
Quiet!

756
01:03:08,779 --> 01:03:12,083
Now, let's make a toast!

757
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,787
Cheers! We'll spendthe entire night toasting.

758
01:03:15,787 --> 01:03:21,925
Mr. Park, bottoms up!

759
01:03:21,925 --> 01:03:25,330
Mr. Park!

760
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:29,600
Now one from your supervisor.

761
01:03:29,600 --> 01:04:00,033
- Here you go~- Just a little bit.

762
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:02,133
- How is it, Mr. Park?- Excuse me?

763
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:07,705
- The kids are hard to deal with, huh?- No, I can handle them.

764
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:11,409
- Are you busy tonight?- Yes, a bit...

765
01:04:11,409 --> 01:04:14,511
Aw~ come on!

766
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:17,249
Aw~ come on!

767
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:22,720
It's a great coincidencethat we're teaching the same class.

768
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,158
This calls for a celebration together!

769
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:26,593
No thank you!

770
01:04:26,593 --> 01:04:47,812
It’ll make your internship much easier.One more round, okay? Okay...

771
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:53,918
Mr. Park, let's go! The second round.

772
01:04:53,918 --> 01:05:01,694
When I first met you in Jeju Isle, I felt weird inside.

773
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:05,164
Miss Kim! Wake up. Please!

774
01:05:05,164 --> 01:05:09,368
Don't take me easy because I'm a spinster!

775
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:13,404
I'll kill you if you do!

776
01:05:13,404 --> 01:05:15,139
I don't believe this is happening!

777
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:22,181
Mr. Park...You know...I went to a fortune teller earliar this year.

778
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:29,288
I'm supposed to marry a younger man.What do you think about this?

779
01:05:29,288 --> 01:05:32,626
What do you mean?We talked about this before!

780
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:37,196
Don't take me easy!

781
01:05:37,196 --> 01:05:43,936
I'll pound you with a brick if you do!

782
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:53,913
Miss Kim... Miss Kim! Miss...Miss Kim, Miss Kim...

783
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:56,349
Where are you going Mr. Park?

784
01:05:56,349 --> 01:06:20,105
Nowhere... drive on, mister.

785
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:28,012
Why are you up?

786
01:06:28,012 --> 01:06:29,449
What?

787
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:31,685
Why didn't you answer your phone?

788
01:06:31,685 --> 01:06:36,088
Your teachers all drink like fishes!

789
01:06:36,088 --> 01:06:38,625
I couldn't keep up.

790
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:42,763
- Why of all schools is it mine?- I know...

791
01:06:42,763 --> 01:06:47,734
If the school finds out, I'm going to die!Be careful!

792
01:06:47,734 --> 01:06:51,038
I'll be careful. Don't worry.There won't be any rumors.

793
01:06:51,038 --> 01:06:52,904
Don't worry. Go to sleep.

794
01:06:52,904 --> 01:06:54,907
Wash up! You stink of liquor.

795
01:06:54,907 --> 01:06:59,212
Okay. Sleep.

796
01:06:59,212 --> 01:07:00,913
Why should I be the only oneto be careful?

797
01:07:00,913 --> 01:07:03,451
- Hey!- What!

798
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:16,230
I'll be careful.

799
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,731
What?

800
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:21,234
Sorry, but can I pee next to you?

801
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:24,604
- No!- I'll turn around.

802
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:28,008
Boeun, I can't hold myself!

803
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:36,684
Oh my god!

804
01:07:36,684 --> 01:07:41,222
What are you doing?

805
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:55,168
Hey! Park Sangmin, what are you doing!

806
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:57,302
Didn't I warn you not to drink too much!

807
01:07:57,302 --> 01:08:37,277
I feel like shit.

808
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:51,224
Now, focus!

809
01:08:51,224 --> 01:08:53,327
Mr. Park.

810
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,497
Huh?

811
01:08:55,497 --> 01:09:00,635
Get a grip on your wife.

812
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:06,306
Mr. Park!

813
01:09:06,306 --> 01:09:10,643
Ah, yes, Miss Kim!

814
01:09:10,643 --> 01:09:17,917
Isn't this adorable?

815
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:22,689
Mr. Park, what are you doing after school?

816
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:26,960
Well, my grandfather's sick.

817
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:33,534
- You must be the first son.- I'm the only son.

818
01:09:33,534 --> 01:09:38,072
Your family must have a weak male line.

819
01:09:38,072 --> 01:09:43,810
We're all sons except for me.Isn't it funny?

820
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,881
I'm just joking.

821
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,283
Mr. Park...

822
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:54,789
- It's okay.- A bright smile.

823
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:58,125
- The kids are watching.- Let them watch.

824
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,995
What's with the old maid?She's caught her prey.

825
01:10:00,995 --> 01:10:02,963
The old maid's pathetic.

826
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:06,835
She made the physical education teachertransfer to another school.

827
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:12,508
- Hello, sir.- Hi.

828
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,942
Was it good?

829
01:10:15,942 --> 01:10:18,011
Were you watching?

830
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:21,516
You seemed to reallyenjoy the cozy lunch together.

831
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:26,688
It was great.Better than the school store's stale bread.

832
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:29,590
Jealous?

833
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,495
You're such a loser!

834
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,663
- Hello, sir.- Uh, yeah.

835
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:42,268
- Hello, Mr. Park.- Uh, yeah, hi.

836
01:10:42,268 --> 01:10:48,776
- Is there a Lee Jungwoo here?- Yes, that will be me.

837
01:10:48,776 --> 01:10:51,279
- Are you Lee Jungwoo?- Yes.

838
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:56,351
- So you're Jungwoo...- Yes, I am Lee Jungwoo.

839
01:10:56,351 --> 01:11:03,456
- Jungwoo, was the sushi good?- What?

840
01:11:03,456 --> 01:11:20,509
You look good. Keep it up!

841
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:50,205
Shit!

842
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:54,375
- Having fun?- Yeah.

843
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:57,779
Hey, I was getting to the fun part!

844
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:00,949
They're all naked. How could you say it's fun?

845
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:04,620
- Don't say that about my hobby!- You call that a hobby?

846
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,322
- Give it to me!- Forget it!

847
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,156
It's educational. Give it back!

848
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:09,958
You should be ashamed of yourself!I'm studying!

849
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,194
Then close the door!

850
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:23,638
- Stop watching!- Shut up!

851
01:12:23,638 --> 01:12:25,676
- Alright, so give it back.- No.

852
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:27,609
- I'm sorry, so give it back.- You're sorry?

853
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,179
It won't stop you from watching it again!

854
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,782
Gimme. Okay.

855
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:54,035
Hey! Do as you wish!

856
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:59,340
Hey! Someone's at the door!

857
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:13,621
Jeez.

858
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:17,325
Boeun! Boeun, Miss Kim's at the door!

859
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:18,827
Miss Kim?

860
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,262
What did you do to make her comeall this way!

861
01:13:21,262 --> 01:13:34,008
I don't know!Hurry and clean this up. Hurry!

862
01:13:34,008 --> 01:13:39,214
Underwear, underwear!

863
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:44,787
Mr. Park~

864
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,623
- Mr. Park!- Oh god!

865
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:51,461
- Oh, the door's open~- Yes...

866
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:56,166
Oh, your place has everything.

867
01:13:56,166 --> 01:14:03,139
- A woman could just fit in.- Miss Kim, what brings you here?

868
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:06,941
Mr. Park, I came to do your dirty laundry.

869
01:14:06,941 --> 01:14:25,827
- Is that your bedroom?- Miss Kim!

870
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:29,666
- What's that?- An automatic vacuum cleaner.

871
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:36,005
Automatic...it does everything by itself...

872
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:55,759
- Someone's here, Mr. Park.- No!

873
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:58,727
It's a ghost, a ghost!

874
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:02,299
Who was that? Who was it?

875
01:15:02,299 --> 01:15:08,706
- It's my sister, she's a bit crazy...- Crazy? It does seem like it...

876
01:15:08,706 --> 01:15:12,575
Munch is a Norwegian painter.

877
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:16,979
A pioneer of expressionism, whosepaintings were of angst and grief.

878
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,348
- Then there was...- Mr. Park.

879
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,117
- Huh, what?- Forget Munch...

880
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:27,057
Tell us about your first artworkin the deptartment Of romance.

881
01:15:27,057 --> 01:15:29,694
- First artwork...- Yes!

882
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:32,762
Let's continue the class!

883
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:38,600
- Your first love!- Mr... tell us about your first love

884
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,472
Okay. My first love was

885
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:49,412
the only visitor during my three yearsof military service.

886
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:56,985
But that person doesn't knowhow much I like her.

887
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,055
Does she still do?

888
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,658
It must be Jisoo.

889
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:12,936
She may or may not know.Now back to class.

890
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:16,338
How's the internship?

891
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:20,376
I'm so unlucky being stuckwith a boys only high school!

892
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:23,245
How could you be luckywhen you're not with the girls?

893
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,615
How about you, Sangmin?

894
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:29,785
Everything's great, thanks to you.

895
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:33,757
I felt that you two neededsome time together.

896
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,725
The dude's having ball.

897
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:38,261
He goes to school where he can meethis pretty wife,

898
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,865
and be surroundedby young high school girls.

899
01:16:40,865 --> 01:16:43,065
How could he get bored there?

900
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,834
I'm bored out of my brains.

901
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:48,272
Seeing my bossy wife at school and at home...

902
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:55,511
Dude, you've got nothing but luck.Take this.

903
01:16:55,511 --> 01:17:00,384
What is it?Military service...

904
01:17:00,384 --> 01:17:10,660
It's tomorrow, so don't be late.And bring coins to play coin games.

905
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,697
Your husband's off to serve his country!

906
01:17:12,697 --> 01:17:13,898
Allegiance!

907
01:17:13,898 --> 01:17:16,900
- No, it's "Victory!"- Victory!

908
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,670
See you later.

909
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:21,805
Oh, and don't forget what I asked you to do.

910
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:24,140
Have fun.

911
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:30,080
Thank you. Morning training's over!

912
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,619
Time has passed, but I still got the form, don't I?

913
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:38,623
Your beer belly is destroying the form.

914
01:17:38,623 --> 01:17:42,359
- They're lining up.- It's the lunch ration line!

915
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:44,961
Morons...

916
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,365
Thank you.

917
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:48,365
Hey, Sangmin, it's noodles...

918
01:17:48,365 --> 01:17:50,167
- Fried tofu noodles?- Yeah.

919
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,335
Can I have another bowl?

920
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:56,706
No, it's okay.

921
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:59,543
You're not eating, right?

922
01:17:59,543 --> 01:18:06,050
Is that sushi?

923
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,651
- Victory!- Victory!

924
01:18:07,651 --> 01:18:22,867
- Thank you.- You're welcome.

925
01:18:22,867 --> 01:18:26,671
- I'm sorry. I just brought only one.- Don't worry.

926
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:30,207
It's okay. Is it good, dude?

927
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:31,977
Don't talk to me. It's delicious.

928
01:18:31,977 --> 01:18:35,379
At least you could offer some.

929
01:18:35,379 --> 01:18:39,317
- Want a piece of kimchi?- Kimchi, kimchi...

930
01:18:39,317 --> 01:18:40,984
Another piece would be nice.

931
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:44,989
A big piece! Let go!

932
01:18:44,989 --> 01:18:50,961
Aren't you marine Park?

933
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:53,465
Victory...

934
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:55,632
Victory!

935
01:18:55,632 --> 01:19:00,137
Victory!

936
01:19:00,137 --> 01:19:01,604
- Invincible!- Invincible!

937
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:03,074
- Marines!- Marines!

938
01:19:03,074 --> 01:19:05,610
Once a marine, always a marine.

939
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,911
What do they want?

940
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:09,880
Marines are all like that.

941
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,818
- Do something!- Ah, delicious.

942
01:19:12,818 --> 01:19:17,723
Stop! Don't touch anything!

943
01:19:17,723 --> 01:19:20,356
Invincible... Marines...

944
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,994
Mister, what do you think you're doing!

945
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:25,230
- Get up!- This won't take long.

946
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:31,336
A feisty one, aren't you?Are you his wife or what?

947
01:19:31,336 --> 01:19:34,739
- Yeah, I am his wife!- Sorry, she's my little sister.

948
01:19:34,739 --> 01:19:36,241
What's there to hide!

949
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:40,411
How dare you push my hubby around? Apologize!

950
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:42,748
- I'm a marine.- Now!

951
01:19:42,748 --> 01:19:45,183
- I'm a marine.- My grandpa's a marine, too!

952
01:19:45,183 --> 01:19:48,719
What's your year rank! What year!?

953
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,522
Hey, Boeun...

954
01:19:50,522 --> 01:19:56,294
Now, I'm leaving for the sea.

955
01:19:56,294 --> 01:20:01,233
Casting a net to catch fish~

956
01:20:01,233 --> 01:20:05,304
I am the romantic cat~

957
01:20:05,304 --> 01:20:07,572
Meow~

958
01:20:07,572 --> 01:20:16,949
My hot lips wish to touch your soft lips.

959
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:27,626
So my feelings can reach your heart~

960
01:20:27,626 --> 01:20:37,837
If you still don't know.

961
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:48,013

We can't meet~The feeling's important~

966
01:21:13,872 --> 01:21:20,378
That's what I think~I don't want things to be too simple~

967
01:21:20,378 --> 01:21:25,749
Even if it may be just this once~The feeling's important~

968
01:21:25,749 --> 01:21:31,823
That's what I think~I don't want things to be too fast~

969
01:21:31,823 --> 01:21:37,664
I still don't know what love is~Wait a little longer~

970
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:44,170
If you really love me~You can wait a little longer~

971
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:49,775
I still don't know what love is~Wait a little longer~

972
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:56,116
If you really love me~You can wait a little longer,

973
01:21:56,116 --> 01:22:02,188
even if it may be just once~The feeling's important ~

974
01:22:02,188 --> 01:22:12,597
I can't meet you, I can't~

975
01:22:12,597 --> 01:22:15,269
Stop it.

976
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:21,041
Stop.

977
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:24,509
- Tickle, tickle~- Stop~

978
01:22:24,509 --> 01:22:27,280

01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,850
- Who are you people?- We're hoodlums.

980
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,984
You're her sugar daddy, aren't you?

981
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:33,853
- Cute.- Really cute.

982
01:22:33,853 --> 01:22:35,622
Do you want to die by my hands!

983
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:37,689
Hey, I'd love to be her sugar daddy.

984
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:43,963
Sangmin, Sangmin, shit!

985
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:45,965
You're all dead meat.

986
01:22:45,965 --> 01:22:49,002
Let go!

987
01:22:49,002 --> 01:22:51,770
Can't you file a paper, right?

988
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:54,340
How can this high schooler be your wife?

989
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:58,311
They all say they're married to the girl when they're caught.

990
01:22:58,311 --> 01:23:00,948
It's true.

991
01:23:00,948 --> 01:23:03,748
I'm no sugar daddy. You can check my record then.

992
01:23:03,748 --> 01:23:08,488
Mister, it's true. We're married.

993
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:11,557
You're both fucking with me, aren't you?

994
01:23:11,557 --> 01:23:30,242
What is the world coming to?

995
01:23:30,242 --> 01:23:37,082
I'm so pissed. How could you get beat up like that?

996
01:23:37,082 --> 01:23:39,217
How will you live in the real world!

997
01:23:39,217 --> 01:23:43,089
How come everyone you meet is a bully?

998
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:46,193
I really worry about you.

999
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:48,662
- Stop...- Keep rolling...

1000
01:23:48,662 --> 01:23:52,766
How will you go to school with a face like that?

1001
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:56,635
I'm worried about school...

1002
01:23:56,635 --> 01:24:06,980
Everything will be okay.Yeah...

1003
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:19,060
Hello.

1004
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,461
Attention!

1005
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:24,497
For this year's school festival,our class is assigned to decorations.

1006
01:24:24,497 --> 01:24:26,333
No!

1007
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:28,202
Quiet!

1008
01:24:28,202 --> 01:24:31,003
Stage decorations will be done by No. 1 to 15.

1009
01:24:31,003 --> 01:24:34,742
The stands and stairways, No. 16 to 21.

1010
01:24:34,742 --> 01:24:39,212
The Entrance, No. 23 to 32.

1011
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:41,480
- And No. 22!- Yes?

1012
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:53,261
No. 22 will do the hall wall. Alone!That's all!

1013
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:55,494
But, Miss Kim!

1014
01:24:55,494 --> 01:24:59,299
That's unfair.How will Boeun paint that huge wall by herself?

1015
01:24:59,299 --> 01:25:05,940
Right! I told her to do it herself! So what!?

1016
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:20,886
With my luck with men, what was I thinking?

1017
01:25:20,886 --> 01:25:38,339
You are huge.

1018
01:25:38,339 --> 01:25:41,273
Have you thought about what you'll paint?

1019
01:25:41,273 --> 01:25:43,510
No.

1020
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:47,747
What do you mean?Even if I wanted to help you,

1021
01:25:47,747 --> 01:25:53,020
I can't, for fear of starting rumors at school.I'm really worried.

1022
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:56,223
I really worry about you, Boeun.

1023
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:58,526
Do you know what I'm thinking?Do you?

1024
01:25:58,526 --> 01:26:22,516
- Cut it out.- Boeun!

1025
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,485
Shhh!

1026
01:26:24,485 --> 01:26:38,433
Follow me.

1027
01:26:38,433 --> 01:26:49,644
Oh my...

1028
01:26:49,644 --> 01:26:54,682
I must be a lesbian.I like my friend better than a boy.

1029
01:26:54,682 --> 01:27:16,537
If you're a lesbian, I'm a cheating wife.

1030
01:27:16,537 --> 01:27:20,707
Hey~ Your husband is so cute.

1031
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:22,944
Stop talking about that loser.

1032
01:27:22,944 --> 01:27:27,347
He keeps staring at you during class.

1033
01:27:27,347 --> 01:27:30,251
He has a cool side to him.

1034
01:27:30,251 --> 01:27:35,757
Cool my ass!

1035
01:27:35,757 --> 01:27:38,792
Suh Boeun!

1036
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:46,099
I know you're seeing Jungwoowith romantic feelings,

1037
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:51,506
but have you ever thoughtabout Sangmin's feelings?

1038
01:27:51,506 --> 01:27:58,980
I really think you like Sangmin.Am I right?

1039
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:22,804
No...Sangmin's just like a big brother since we were little.

1040
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:27,109
- Stop fooling around.- You're always on my back.

1041
01:28:27,109 --> 01:28:43,225
- Hey, sew her mouth, shut.- Uh?

1042
01:28:43,225 --> 01:28:48,664
Wow, look at all this food.The table's barely holding up.

1043
01:28:48,664 --> 01:28:51,032
- Eat.- Thank you for the meal.

1044
01:28:51,032 --> 01:28:56,172
Thank you for the meal, mom.

1045
01:28:56,172 --> 01:29:02,010
Easy. Have you been skipping meals?

1046
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,211
I've really been busy.

1047
01:29:04,211 --> 01:29:08,617
I missed your cooking, it's delicious.

1048
01:29:08,617 --> 01:29:11,219
You shouldn't say that,your wife's right here.

1049
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:14,690
You'll hurt Boeun's feelings.

1050
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:19,529
Mom, don't worry. I'm undernourished.

1051
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:24,198
When Boeun reaches twenty,you'll totally forget mom's cooking.

1052
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:29,072
Boeun, I've put food in the fridge,so don't forget, okay?

1053
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,871
There'll be more when you're done with it.

1054
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,140
Yes...

1055
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,976
Okay, it's late.I'm leaving after dinner.

1056
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,145
Yes.

1057
01:29:36,145 --> 01:29:40,083
Mom, it's raining.Sleep over at your son's place.

1058
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,885
Yes, mom.

1059
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:46,154
Is it okay?

1060
01:29:46,154 --> 01:29:50,257
Sleep over, sleep over.Eat, mom.

1061
01:29:50,257 --> 01:29:52,126
Oh, okay.

1062
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:57,599
It's your son's place. What's the big deal!

1063
01:29:57,599 --> 01:30:00,635
Oh, great. So comfortable.

1064
01:30:00,635 --> 01:30:07,210
Turn around.No, not this way, but the other.

1065
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:11,413
Okay.

1066
01:30:11,413 --> 01:30:23,593
- Stay in that direction.- Okay, pest.

1067
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:29,131
- Are you asleep, Boeun?- No...

1068
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:33,235
You can't sleep?

1069
01:30:33,235 --> 01:30:38,407
- Sangmin, I thought about it...- Yeah...

1070
01:30:38,407 --> 01:30:44,881
It's not fair to you.

1071
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:52,454
Look at me, Sangmin.

1072
01:30:52,454 --> 01:30:55,591
What?

1073
01:30:55,591 --> 01:31:01,465
Did you know? That you're really cute?

1074
01:31:01,465 --> 01:31:05,568
You're pretty yourself.

1075
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:24,220
- Sangmin.- Yeah, Boeun...

1076
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:28,358
Boeun...

1077
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,393
Sangmin, what are you doing?

1078
01:31:30,393 --> 01:31:33,197
- What do you think?- Stop!

1079
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:34,699
Wait, Boeun.

1080
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:56,551
Uh, stop it!

1081
01:31:56,551 --> 01:32:08,397
Sleep.

1082
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:11,301
Did we paint that much?

1083
01:32:11,301 --> 01:32:14,037
Let's hurry up with this.There's not much time left till the festival.

1084
01:32:14,037 --> 01:32:26,049
- Hurry!- Okay.

1085
01:32:26,049 --> 01:32:31,521
Hey, wait!

1086
01:32:31,521 --> 01:32:41,330
Gotcha, gotcha!

1087
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:49,839
I see you've been working hard, but can you finish at this pace?

1088
01:32:49,839 --> 01:32:51,874
The festival's coming up.

1089
01:32:51,874 --> 01:32:58,148
Don't worry. We'll be done by then.Yeah, and it'll look great too.

1090
01:32:58,148 --> 01:33:04,421
Really? We'll see about that...

1091
01:33:04,421 --> 01:33:08,758
I've seen enough...

1092
01:33:08,758 --> 01:33:12,729
Whatever...

1093
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:16,299
The hag has appeared.

1094
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:20,403
To find fault in our wall painting.

1095
01:33:20,403 --> 01:33:22,339
Miss Kim,

1096
01:33:22,339 --> 01:33:24,374
Miss Kim,

1097
01:33:24,374 --> 01:33:28,512
with her nasty tone, she will...

1098
01:33:28,512 --> 01:33:32,051
I hate to admit it, but we've done a horrible job.

1099
01:33:32,051 --> 01:33:37,521
- It's okay.- Really?

1100
01:33:37,521 --> 01:33:42,392
Let's wash our hands and grab some snacks.

1101
01:33:42,392 --> 01:33:45,729
Are you taking care of Sangmin's meals?

1102
01:33:45,729 --> 01:33:47,698
It's really hard to be an intern you know.

1103
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:50,200
It couldn't be that hard!

1104
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,936
Hey, but he's your husband.

1105
01:33:52,936 --> 01:33:58,075
Hey, I'm busy myself.And he'll never skip a meal.

1106
01:33:58,075 --> 01:33:59,809
What kind of wife are you?

1107
01:33:59,809 --> 01:34:02,945
Then you be his wife.Mrs. Park Sangmin.

1108
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:05,484
Forget it. I don't want it.

1109
01:34:05,484 --> 01:34:21,766
- Why the sudden interest!- Shut up.

1110
01:34:21,766 --> 01:34:25,470
Hey, Park Sangmin! Where are you?

1111
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:33,777
Shouldn't you be helping me?

1112
01:34:33,777 --> 01:34:50,495
I couldn't believe it myself!

1113
01:34:50,495 --> 01:34:52,294
- Coke.- Thanks.

1114
01:34:52,294 --> 01:34:53,797
- Good?- Yeah.

1115
01:34:53,797 --> 01:35:03,041
- Eat up. We'll be painting until dawn.- What?

1116
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:05,574
Hey, isn't she a babe?

1117
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:07,244
She's the queen of Sunil Girls' Jr. High.

1118
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:09,012
- Hey, let me see.- Hey!

1119
01:35:09,012 --> 01:35:12,416
I'm going to make a move on her,so nice shots, please.

1120
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:16,221
Okay.

1121
01:35:16,221 --> 01:35:18,922
Just don't get blown off.

1122
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:26,330
From this day on,she's Suh Dongku's woman!

1123
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:31,035
Excuse me, but,aren't you going to Sunil Girls' Jr. High?

1124
01:35:31,035 --> 01:35:34,372
Hey! Over there.Isn't that Dongku's sister?

1125
01:35:34,372 --> 01:35:38,107
Where? It really is his sister.

1126
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:40,845
Her husband looked older than that...

1127
01:35:40,845 --> 01:35:42,815
Then, who's that?

1128
01:35:42,815 --> 01:35:45,717
She must've fallen for a younger dude.

1129
01:35:45,717 --> 01:36:00,331
Nice.

1130
01:36:00,331 --> 01:36:03,836
The whole family's fooling around!

1131
01:36:03,836 --> 01:36:07,204
I got her number. Did you get a good shot?

1132
01:36:07,204 --> 01:36:26,091
Here.

1133
01:36:26,091 --> 01:36:31,562
COME TO THE MONTHLY FAMILY DINNERBEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1134
01:36:31,562 --> 01:36:35,869
Jungwoo, I have to go home.

1135
01:36:35,869 --> 01:36:46,511
Already?

1136
01:36:46,511 --> 01:36:48,147
Hurry in and sit.

1137
01:36:48,147 --> 01:36:50,347
Can't you be more early?

1138
01:36:50,347 --> 01:36:51,716
Leave her alone.

1139
01:36:51,716 --> 01:36:54,853
It's okay. Let's eat.

1140
01:36:54,853 --> 01:36:58,122
The chili squid was great...

1141
01:36:58,122 --> 01:37:03,361
Attention, please.I'll now show you my girlfriend!

1142
01:37:03,361 --> 01:37:06,330
- Do you have a girlfriend?- Yes, of course.

1143
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:11,335
- Now take a good look.- That's her?

1144
01:37:11,335 --> 01:37:13,572
She's better than your sister.

1145
01:37:13,572 --> 01:37:22,548
- Hey, look... look...- Who's that? Huh?

1146
01:37:22,548 --> 01:37:26,017
Hey, Boeun!

1147
01:37:26,017 --> 01:37:27,385
Hey!

1148
01:37:27,385 --> 01:38:00,986
Boeun!

1149
01:38:00,986 --> 01:38:04,323
When you were little,

1150
01:38:04,323 --> 01:38:14,667
I always pushed you on this swing here.You really loved it.

1151
01:38:14,667 --> 01:38:19,271
But one day,

1152
01:38:19,271 --> 01:38:25,410
you fell off the swing while I was pushing.

1153
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:29,080
I actually did it on purpose.

1154
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:42,426
I'm sorry, Sangmin...

1155
01:38:42,426 --> 01:39:09,388
Everyone will be worried.Let's go.

1156
01:39:09,388 --> 01:39:11,657
This marriage...

1157
01:39:11,657 --> 01:39:15,594
it seems like your grandpa forced you into it,

1158
01:39:15,594 --> 01:39:22,968
but in fact we wanted to haveSangmin as our son-in-law.

1159
01:39:22,968 --> 01:39:28,907
Do you remember? How often you would cry?

1160
01:39:28,907 --> 01:39:34,948
But whenever Sangmin came,a smile would spread on your face.

1161
01:39:34,948 --> 01:39:39,219
You would fall all the time.

1162
01:39:39,219 --> 01:39:51,932
Scraping and breaking yourself.Sangmin felt worse than I did.

1163
01:39:51,932 --> 01:40:03,910
He carried you on his back all the time, that Sangmin.

1164
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:05,745
Anyway, I envy you.

1165
01:40:05,745 --> 01:40:09,281
The way he spends more time on your schoolfestival than his graduation exhibition,

1166
01:40:09,281 --> 01:42:20,546
I guess he's gone to paint the wall with Yongju and Youngchul...

1167
01:42:20,546 --> 01:42:56,717
Sangmin! Sangmin!

1168
01:42:56,717 --> 01:43:00,421
Sangmin! I came with the family to see you,

1169
01:43:00,421 --> 01:43:03,926
but an emergency at your squad forces me to turn away.

1170
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:06,294
Are you doing well?

1171
01:43:06,294 --> 01:43:09,596
A few days ago, heavy snow came down in Seoul.

1172
01:43:09,596 --> 01:43:12,399
The Han River is frozen as well...

1173
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:17,837
It's colder here, right?Don't catch a cold.

1174
01:43:17,837 --> 01:43:20,875
And this is a secret

1175
01:43:20,875 --> 01:43:25,146
but my mom says that I've become a woman now.

1176
01:43:25,146 --> 01:43:27,248
I'm a bit behind than the other girls,

1177
01:43:27,248 --> 01:43:33,521
but being an idiot that you are,you won't understand what I mean, will you?

1178
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:38,926
It's strange but when you were around, I hated your guts,

1179
01:43:38,926 --> 01:43:42,630
but your absence has me missing you.

1180
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:44,598
Are you feeling the same?

1181
01:43:44,598 --> 01:43:49,805
Then be good to me from now on. Stupid.

1182
01:43:49,805 --> 01:43:55,910
The disappointment of not being ableto meet you has your mom crying.

1183
01:43:55,910 --> 01:44:57,839
Anyway, this letter, I hope it reaches you.

1184
01:44:57,839 --> 01:45:01,010
Where have you been?I've been looking all over for you.

1185
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:03,176
The wall's great.

1186
01:45:03,176 --> 01:45:08,250
- I... have something to say.- Yeah, what?

1187
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:12,488
I'm sorry. I've been so selfish.

1188
01:45:12,488 --> 01:45:16,089
To you and...

1189
01:45:16,089 --> 01:45:18,893
What's got into you?

1190
01:45:18,893 --> 01:45:30,505
I'm breaking up with you.I'm sorry, Jungwoo.

1191
01:45:30,505 --> 01:45:38,414
People laugh and dance but I hate to laugh~

1192
01:45:38,414 --> 01:45:48,588
While we drink and search for love,we forget about the truth~

1193
01:45:48,588 --> 01:45:50,725
Why are you late?

1194
01:45:50,725 --> 01:45:52,260
Did you see him?

1195
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,895
Who? Your husband or boyfriend?

1196
01:45:54,895 --> 01:45:57,098
I'm not kidding!

1197
01:45:57,098 --> 01:45:59,101
There he is.

1198
01:45:59,101 --> 01:46:03,538
I like the smiling clown~Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah~

1199
01:46:03,538 --> 01:46:23,258
I like the clown who embraces sadness~

1200
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:25,260
Aren't they great?

1201
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:39,241
Now, intern, Park Sangmin will share a few words with us.

1202
01:46:39,241 --> 01:46:44,713
I thank everyone, the principal, all the teachers...

1203
01:46:44,713 --> 01:46:54,689
and all the students for helping me finishthis internship in one piece.

1204
01:46:54,689 --> 01:46:57,559
It may have been a short time,

1205
01:46:57,559 --> 01:46:59,795
but personally,

1206
01:46:59,795 --> 01:47:12,409
it has left me with precious memoriesI will carry for the rest of my life.

1207
01:47:12,409 --> 01:47:17,480
Mr. Intern, cut the boring crap and show us some honestly.

1208
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:26,055
Mr. Park Sangmin is a married man.

1209
01:47:26,055 --> 01:47:27,723
Didn't you know?

1210
01:47:27,723 --> 01:47:32,394
Of course, it's not a sin to be married.

1211
01:47:32,394 --> 01:47:38,435
But in fact you're married to a 15 year oldhigh school girl, right?

1212
01:47:38,435 --> 01:47:51,949
To Suh Boeun who's sitting right there...

1213
01:47:51,949 --> 01:47:55,952
Correct. We are married.

1214
01:47:55,952 --> 01:47:58,955
But Boeun had no choice.

1215
01:47:58,955 --> 01:48:03,893
The only crime she's committed was grantingher sick grandfather's last wish.

1216
01:48:03,893 --> 01:48:09,399
It was against her will to marry me.

1217
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:18,441
She may be married, but she's still a 15 year old high school girl.

1218
01:48:18,441 --> 01:48:25,914
She goes crazy over a bowl of chili and spaghetti.

1219
01:48:25,914 --> 01:48:36,993
She loves cute stars and sushi-...loving attractive baseball players.

1220
01:48:36,993 --> 01:48:42,632
Everyday, she's stressed over exams,and applying to university.

1221
01:48:42,632 --> 01:48:53,843
I hope you won't persecute Boeun'sschool life over a marriage document.

1222
01:48:53,843 --> 01:48:57,882
I beg you all.

1223
01:48:57,882 --> 01:49:06,923
Sangmin, I'm not a kid anymore.

1224
01:49:06,923 --> 01:49:12,262
Since I was little, you were always at my side.

1225
01:49:12,262 --> 01:49:19,501
I was never aware of the strange feelings...inside...

1226
01:49:19,501 --> 01:50:14,893
but... I think I'm in love with you...

1227
01:50:14,893 --> 01:50:18,796
Our poor Dongku.She's the end of all your fun and play.

1228
01:50:18,796 --> 01:50:19,963
Fun and play...

1229
01:50:19,963 --> 01:50:22,834
I knew it since he was fixed onthat school queen or whatever...

1230
01:50:22,834 --> 01:50:26,069
I can't believe grandpa fell for her grandmother.

1231
01:50:26,069 --> 01:50:28,871
- I can't believe it...- She looks bright though.

1232
01:50:28,871 --> 01:50:33,844
Just consider it starting early! Do it!

1233
01:50:33,844 --> 01:50:35,145
Do it!

1234
01:50:35,145 --> 01:50:39,315
Oh, shut up and peel the garlic.

1235
01:50:39,315 --> 01:50:42,420
I'm in no position to say this, but

1236
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:46,756
you can hide a lop-sided butt, but not lop-sized balls.

1237
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:48,726
Anyway, congrats.

1238
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:50,195
It's good that she doesn't have a clue.

1239
01:50:50,195 --> 01:50:55,099
Who would marry a lop-sized ball manif they knew, right?

1240
01:50:55,099 --> 01:50:57,967
Right.

1241
01:50:57,967 --> 01:51:01,972
Oh, you're here!

1242
01:51:01,972 --> 01:51:03,506
Oh, dad!

1243
01:51:03,506 --> 01:51:04,808
You're here.

1244
01:51:04,808 --> 01:51:09,313
I'm really getting into peeling these things...

1245
01:51:09,313 --> 01:51:14,517
Did you get married to peel garlic?

1246
01:51:14,517 --> 01:51:16,154
Mom!

1247
01:51:16,154 --> 01:51:19,757
Okay!

1248
01:51:19,757 --> 99:59:59,999
Say cheese. One, two, three!!

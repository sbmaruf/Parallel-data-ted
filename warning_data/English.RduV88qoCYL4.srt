1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it’s perfect.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
♫ My oh my, walking by, who’s the apple of my eye? ♫

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
♫ Why, it's my very own Clonie. ♫

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
♫ Oh, if I should stroll the hood, who knew I could look so good ♫

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
♫ just talking on the phone to Clonie. ♫

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
♫ We are pals, it's cool, 'cause we're not lonely, ♫

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
♫ shallow gene pool is nothing to my only Clonie. ♫

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Me and you, hustling through, holding on through thick and thin, ♫

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
♫ just day by day, our DNA, so the Olson twins got nothing on us. ♫

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ We'll survive, side by side. Mother Nature, don’t you call her phony, she’s my Clonie. ♫

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
♫ Was wealthy, but not healthy, had no one to dwell with me, ♫

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
♫ so look who I got born -- Clonie. ♫

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ Far from broke, bored, rich folk, we don't need no natural yolk -- ♫

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
♫ our babies come full-formed, Clonie. ♫

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
♫ We'll be huggable, get a publicist ♫

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
♫ and show them, be the most lovable thing since fucking Eminem. ♫

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
♫ Oh my friend, multiply, we’re a franchise, like Walt Disney or Hannibal Lecter. ♫

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
♫ We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector. ♫

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
♫ We’ll survive side by side, should have signed with Verve instead of Sony. ♫

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
♫ You’re my Clonie. ♫ "Oh Clonie, how I love you."

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
"Ha, I'm the only person I ever loved."

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
♫ Gee, that's swell. I guess you're just my fatal attraction-ie. You’re my Clonie. ♫

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
(Applause)

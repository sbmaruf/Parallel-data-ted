1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,110
A cliff diver dives off of a
cliff 85 feet above the water.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,850
If the diver's initial vertical
velocity is negative

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,480
5 feet per second-- so he's
going downward, so they tell

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,700
us right here-- 5 feet per
second downward, and the

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,680
acceleration of gravity is
negative 32 feet per second

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,660
squared, or 32 feet per second
downward-- so that means after

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,110
every second, you're going 32
feet per second faster in the

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,620
downward direction-- how long is
the diver in the air before

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,170
entering the water?

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,400
So let's just set a variable t
to be what we want to solve

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,640
for, which is how long is
the diver in the air?

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,165
Let me just write
time in the air.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,490
And we have the initial velocity
of the diver right

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,330
here, the initial vertical
velocity, and that's what we

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:58,860
care about.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,710
We just care about what's going
on in the up and down

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,390
direction, the vertical
direction.

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,415
So our initial velocity is
negative 5 feet per second.

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,660
Now, what's going to be his
velocity right when he hits

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,910
the water, right when
he enters the water?

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,393
What's going to be his
final velocity?

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,580
He's going to start at negative
5 feet per second, so

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,780
it's going to be negative 5 feet
per second, that's his

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,970
initial velocity.

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,000
And every second that goes by,
he's going to be going

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,680
negative 32 feet per second
faster after every second.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,970
He's accelerating downward
at that rate.

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,780
So if you multiply the
acceleration times time,

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,540
that's how much his velocity
is increased.

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:59,960
So it's going to be his initial
velocity minus 32 feet

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,940
per second squared.

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,660
That's the acceleration times
time-- times the time that

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,440
he's in the air, times this t.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,660
Obviously, this will be in
seconds, so we have 1 second

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,580
over seconds squared.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,290
You'll just have a second in
the denominator, so you'll

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,210
have feet per second and
feet per second.

38
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,260
The units all work out.

39
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,310
But hopefully this
makes sense.

40
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,880
He's starting off at moving
downward at 5 feet per second.

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,330
The negative is telling you the
direction is downward, so

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,330
he's moving downward at
5 feet per second.

43
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,070
So after 1 second,
he'll be going 37

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,520
feet per second downward.

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,040
After 2 seconds, he'll be
going-- what, 32 times 2 is

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,430
64, plus 9-- 69 feet per
second downwards.

47
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,270
So this is his final velocity.

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,880
So what's his average
velocity?

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,320
If his initial velocity is
negative 5 feet per second,

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,410
his final velocity is this.

51
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,360
It's a linear relation.

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,270
At every second that goes by,
it's linearly increasing, or

53
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,650
decreasing, if you want to view
it as a negative number.

54
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,810
So the average velocity is just
going to be the average

55
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,030
of these two values.

56
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,910
We're really just learning a lot
of physics here, but this

57
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,500
will set us up with a nice
quadratic equation that we can

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,000
use the quadratic formula for.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,230
So our average velocity is going
to be the average of

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,360
those two velocities.

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,780
So it's going to be-- and I'll
skip the units right now--

62
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:29,760
it's going to be negative 5
minus 5, minus 32t, all of

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,890
that over 2.

64
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,550
I'm just averaging
these two things.

65
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,845
That's my initial velocity.

66
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:34,985
This is my final velocity.

67
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:37,080
I'm just taking the average
of the two.

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,110
So this is going to
be equal to what?

69
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:45,470
This is negative 10 minus 32t
over 2, which is equal to

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,380
negative 5 minus 16t.

71
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm just dividing
everything by 2.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,100
So this is my average
velocity.

73
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,450
Now, we can just apply our
simple distance is equal to

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,700
rate times time.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,180
Now, what's the distance
that he's

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,940
traveling in this situation?

77
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,140
Well, he's diving off of a cliff
85 feet above the water,

78
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,510
so the distance that
he's going to be

79
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:17,019
traveling is 85 feet.

80
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,519
He starts 85 feet above the
water, but the distance he'll

81
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,800
travel, he's going to
go 85 feet down.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,790
So the distance he's going to
travel is negative 85 feet.

83
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,310
We use negative for down,
we use positive for up.

84
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,790
Everything in this problem is

85
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,500
happening in the down direction.

86
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,040
So negative 85 feet is
going to be equal

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,250
to the average velocity.

88
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,820
But we just figured out
the average velocity.

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,780
It's this thing right here.

90
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,020
That's our average velocity.

91
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,170
So it's going to be-- let me do
it in another color; let me

92
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,630
do it in this blue-- our
average velocity is

93
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,880
negative 5 minus 16t.

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,410
That's our average velocity,
velocity average.

95
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,650
And then we want to multiply
that times time.

96
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,940
This is our velocity, our
rate-- I'm mixing up the

97
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,050
colors-- this is our rate, and
then we want to multiply it by

98
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,240
times, so rate times time is
equal to distance travelled.

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,450
Let's solve for t.

100
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,160
And we'll skip the units for
now, just because that'll kind

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,500
of get in the way of
maybe the learning.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,010
So we have negative 85 is equal
to-- when we distribute

103
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,370
this t, we get negative
5t minus 16t squared.

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,810
And now we can add 85 to both
sides of this equation.

105
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,500
Let's add 85 to both sides.

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,520
And we are left with
0 is equal to--

107
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,790
let's rearrange this.

108
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:54,210
So we'll a negative 16t squared
minus 5t, plus 85.

109
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,990
So this, essentially,
is the equation.

110
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,340
If we solve for t, we'll know
how long he's been in the air,

111
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,040
because we've used all of
the other constraints.

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,340
So this is a straight up
quadratic equation, so we

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,810
could use the quadratic
formula here.

114
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,320
So it's going to
be negative b.

115
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,300
Now what's b?

116
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,400
b here is negative 5, so
negative b, which is negative

117
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,250
negative 5, plus or minus the
square root of b squared.

118
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,500
Negative 5 squared is 25 minus
4, times a, which is negative

119
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,730
16, times c, which is 85.

120
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,070
All of that over 2 times a. a
is negative 16, so 2 times

121
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,110
that is negative 32.

122
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,470
So the time is equal to positive
5, right, negative

123
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,720
negative 5 is positive 5, plus
or minus the square root of--

124
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,250
we probably want to take out
our calculator for this.

125
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,560
Let's see, let's
evaluate this.

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,640
So we have a negative and a
negative, so those two are

127
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,380
going to cancel-- let
put my calculator

128
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,550
aside right for a second.

129
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,310
So we have negative out here,
and then we have a negative,

130
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,930
so these two are going
to cancel out.

131
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,590
So it's going to be 25 plus
4, times 16, times 85.

132
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,000
So let's figure out
what that is.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,450
So if we have 25 plus-- I'll put
some parentheses here-- 4

134
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:33,330
times 16, times 85 is equal
to-- so we got 25 plus 4,

135
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,630
times 16, times 85--
is equal to 5,465.

136
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,120
And we could take the
square root of this.

137
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,440
So let's just take the square
root of it, and we have 73.9.

138
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
So let's just stick with 73.9.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,860
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me delete this right

140
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,790
here-- this is going to be equal
to, we already figured

141
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,380
out what the square root is, we
just evaluated it-- let me

142
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,870
delete that right there-- this
is going to be equal to plus

143
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,730
or minus 73.9, all of that
over negative 32.

144
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,670
Now, we can add 73.9, and we
can subtract 73.9, but what

145
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,850
happens if we subtract 73.9?

146
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,020
Well, actually, let's think
about this carefully.

147
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,960
Let's do both of these.

148
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,010
Let's just go through them.

149
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,740
So the two combinations, so the
two possibilities for t,

150
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,730
is we have 5 plus 73.9, which
is 78.9, all of that over

151
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,020
negative 32.

152
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,659
That's one possibility for t.

153
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,420
The other one is 5 minus 73.9.

154
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,530
And let's see, what's
73.9 minus 5?

155
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,560
It is negative 68.9.

156
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,360
73 minus 5 is 68, swap the
negatives, so it's negative

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,680
68.9 over negative 32.

158
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,610
In this case, the negatives
cancel out.

159
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,040
So which of these-- can we
use both of these times?

160
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,500
Well, this right here is going
to be a negative number, and

161
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,520
we don't want a negative time.

162
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,280
It's definitely a positive
amount of time

163
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,900
that he's in the air.

164
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,620
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

165
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,360
negative time, are we
going back in time?

166
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,100
Who knows?

167
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,490
So we can't even use that.

168
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,406
So the time in the air is going
to be this, it's going

169
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:22,690
to be 68.9 divided by 32, so
let's figure out what that is.

170
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:32,380
So it's 68.9 divided by 32
is equal to 2.15 seconds.

171
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:40,240
So his time in the air is going
to be 2.15 seconds.

172
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,820
And we're done.

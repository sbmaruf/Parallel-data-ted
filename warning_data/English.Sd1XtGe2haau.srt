1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,384
we're asked to simply log base 3 of 27x

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:06,715
and frankly this is already quite simple,

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,523
but I'm assuming they want us to use

4
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:11,110
some logarithm properties and manipulate this some way

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,346
maybe actually make it a little more complicated

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,323
and let's give this our best shot at it

7
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:17,946
so the logarithm property that jumps out at me

8
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:19,921
because this, right over here, is saying

9
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,731
what power do we have to raise 3 to in order to get 27x

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,444
27x is the same thing as 27 times x

11
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:30,552
and so the logarithm property it seems like they want us to use is

12
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:40,110
log base b of a times c

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,656
this is equal to

14
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:48,079
the logarithm base b of a plus logarithm base b of c

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,982
now this comes straight out of the exponent properties

16
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:54,705
that if you have two exponents with the same base

17
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,421
you can add the exponents

18
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,121
now let me make this a little bit clearer to you

19
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,910
now if this part is a little confusing the important part for this example is

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,656
is that you know how to apply this,

21
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,479
but it's even better if you know the intuition

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,571
so let's say that log, let's say that log base b of a times c is equal to x

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,777
so this thing right over here evaluates to x

24
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:17,587
let's say that this thing right over here evaluates to y

25
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:22,079
so log base b of a is equal to y

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,438
and let's say that that this thing over here evaluates to z

27
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:32,279
so log base b of c is equal to z

28
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,715
now, what we know is

29
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:37,715
this thing right over here, this thing right over here

30
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:39,715
or this thing right over here tells us

31
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:46,829
tells us that b, to the x power is equal to a times c

32
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,823
now, this right over here is telling us that

33
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:54,187
b to the y power is equal to a

34
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,859
and this over here is telling us

35
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,823
that b to the z power is equal to c

36
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:02,029
let me do that in that same green

37
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,198
so i'm just writing the same truth

38
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:06,448
i'm writing as an exponential function

39
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:08,025
or exponential equation

40
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:08,525
instead of a logarithmic equation

41
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:13,685
so b to the zth power is equal to c

42
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:16,285
these are all, this is the same statement

43
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:18,015
this is the same statement

44
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,352
or they're the same truth said in a different way

45
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:23,377
and this is the same truth said in a different way

46
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,500
well if we know that, if we know that

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,531
a is equal to this, is equal to b to the y,

48
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:33,813
we can, and c is equal to b-z

49
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:36,438
then we can write

50
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:41,808
b to the x power is equal to b to the y power

51
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,962
that's what a is, we know that already

52
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:47,275
times b to the z power

53
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,479
times b to the z power

54
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,290
and we know, from our exponent properites

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,208
we know from our exponent properties

56
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,936
That if we take b to the y times b to the z

57
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,744
this is the same thing as:

58
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:04,571
b to the, I'll do it in neutral color, b to the y plus z power

59
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,771
this came straight out of our exponent properties.

60
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:09,905
And so if b to the y plus z power is the same thing

61
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:15,490
b to the x power -- that tells us that x must be equal to y plus z.

62
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,023
x must be equal to y plus z.

63
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,695
If this is confusing to you -- don't worry too much.

64
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:24,264
The important thing, or at least the first important thing is

65
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:26,536
that you know how to apply it and then you can think about this

66
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,459
a little bit more and you can even try it out with some numbers.

67
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,562
You have to just realise that logarithms are really just exponents.

68
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:34,675
I know, when people at first tell me: what does that mean?

69
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:38,269
But when you evaluate a logarithm - you're getting an exponent

70
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,608
that you would have to raise b to, in order to get a times c.

71
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:45,141
But let's just apply this property right over here.

72
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,223
So if we apply to this one we know that

73
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:51,669
log base 3 of 27 times x -- I'll write it that way --

74
00:03:51,669 --> 00:04:02,325
is equal to log base 3 of 27 plus log base 3 of x.

75
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,777
And then this right over here we can evaluate,

76
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:10,633
this tells us: what power do I have to raise 3 to get to 27.

77
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:15,152
You can view it this way: 3 to the question mark is equal to 27.

78
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:19,125
Well, 3 to the 3rd power is equal to 27.

79
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,577
3 times 3 is 9, times 3 is 27.

80
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,567
To this right over here evaluates to 3.

81
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,275
So if we were to simplify -- or I guess I wouldn't even call it

82
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:29,171
simplifying, I'll just call it expanding it out or using this property.

83
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,392
We now have two terms, where when we started of with one term.

84
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,782
Actually if we started with this, I'd say that this is the more simple version of it.

85
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:40,095
But when we rewrite it, this first term becomes 3.

86
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,248
So this first term becomes 3

87
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,818
and then we're left with plus log base 3 of x.

88
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:50,198
So this is just an alternate way of writing this original statement.

89
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:54,613
Log base 3 of 27x.

90
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:58,546
So once again -- not clear that this is simpler than this right over here.

91
00:04:58,546 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just another way of writing it using logarithm properties.

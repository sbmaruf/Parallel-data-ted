1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810


2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,510
We're asked to compute
347 divided by 5.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,980
So let me just rewrite
it like this.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:13,490
We have 347-- let me
write it bigger.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:21,530
We have 347, and we want to
divide it by-- so I'll put the

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,150
division sign here, maybe the
long division sign, depending

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,160
on how you want to view it,
and then I'll put the 5 in

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,299
blue-- divided by 5.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,040
So the first thing we do is
say does 5 go into 3?

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
No, it doesn't, so let's
add another digit here.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,590
Does 5 go into 34?

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,590
Well, 5 times 6 is equal to 30,
so that goes into it, and

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,290
if we go above that, 5 times 7
is equal to 35, so that's too

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,180
big, so it goes into
34 six times.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,260
Because if we went with 7,
we would've gotten 35.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,350
That's too big.

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,340
So 5 goes into 34 six times.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,560
6 times 5 is 30-- we
saw that right over

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,960
there-- and we subtract.

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,850
34 minus 30.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,670
Let me do this in a new color.

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,090
34 minus 30.

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,460
Well, 4 minus 0 is 4.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,040
3 minus 3 is just 0, and then we
can bring down this 7 here.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,310
5 goes into 47 how many times?

26
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,890
Let's see, 5 times 8 is equal to
40, so that would work, but

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,240
let's see if we can go
in even more times.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,200
5 times 9 is equal to 45.

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,780
That'll work.

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,310
That's still less than 47.

31
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:43,350
Then we have 5 times 10 is
50, so this is too big.

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,410
So we want to go with 5 times
9 is equal to 45, or 5 goes

33
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,290
into 47 nine times.

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,310
9 times 5 is 45, and then
you subtract again.

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,410
47 minus 45 is 2.

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,040
And then we're done.

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,400
There's nothing else
to bring down here.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,480
One day, we'll learn about
dividing it into decimals and

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,720
getting some kind of a decimal
representation, but we're not

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,280
going to worry about
that right now.

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,670
We have nothing left
to bring down.

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,025
So 347 divided by 5 is 69.

43
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:20,560
It is 69.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,930
It is equal to 69, but it
doesn't go evenly into 347.

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,470
There's something left over.

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,050
There's a remainder.

47
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,960
There is a remainder
right here.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,710
So it equals 69, and sometimes
you'll see it written as

49
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,100
remainder 2, or sometimes
it's a capital R.

50
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,640
Sometimes people will write out
the word "remainder." So 5

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,430
goes into 347 sixty-nine times,
but you're going to

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,180
have 2 left over.

53
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,580
Or another way to think about
it is 5 times 69 is 345, so

54
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,820
you're always going to have
2 left over in this

55
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,890
circumstance.

56
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,700
So that is our answer.

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,199

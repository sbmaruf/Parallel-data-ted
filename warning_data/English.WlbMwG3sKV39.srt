1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,970
A standard elevator in a
mid-rise building can hold a

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:08,050
maximum weight of
1 and 1/2 tons.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,220
Assuming an average adult weight
of 160 pounds, what is

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,170
the maximum number of
adults who could

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,130
safely ride the elevator?

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,480
So what we need to do is we have
to get the maximum weight

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,760
that the elevator could hold
in terms of pounds.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,970
And then say, OK, well, how
many adults is that?

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,930
So they gave us the maximum
weight in terms of tons.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,070
So they say it is
1 and 1/2 tons.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,870
And it's always easier to deal
with improper fractions than

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,350
mixed numbers, so let's write
this as an improper fraction.

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,500
1 and 1/2 tons is the same thing
as-- well, 1 ton is 2

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,230
halves, and then you
add another 1

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,870
half, that's 3 halves.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,990
So you get 3/2 tons.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,700
Or another way to think about
it is 2 times 1 is

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,640
2, plus 1 is 3.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,550
So the maximum capacity
is 3/2 tons.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's think about how
many pounds that is.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And to do that, we have to
know that there are 2,000

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,769
pounds per ton.

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,870
Let me write this up here.

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,260
We know that there are
2,000 pounds per ton.

25
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,240
This wasn't given in the
problem anywhere.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,300
This is something I knew from
past experience, and it's a

27
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,950
good thing to know,
in general, that a

28
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,090
ton is 2,000 pounds.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,630
So I'm going to write
it right over here.

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,280
Now, how do we convert these
3/2 tons into pounds?

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,640
Well, we're going to multiply it
by something, and the units

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,590
that we're going to multiply
by, we want the

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,780
tons to cancel out.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,170
So we're going to want to have
tons in the denominator, so it

35
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,520
cancels out with this
tons up here.

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,760
And then we want pounds
in the numerator.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,900
And that's exactly what
we wrote up here.

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,760
There are 2,000 pounds for every
1 ton, or you could just

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,640
say 2,000 pounds per ton.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
You could put the 1 there, but
it doesn't really change the

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,940
expression.

42
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,260
Now, if we multiply 3/2 tons
times 2,000 pounds per ton,

43
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,030
what'll happen is that
the tons cancel out.

44
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,240
That was the whole point of
multiplying it by this.

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:15,860
And we would be left with 3/2
times 2,000, and the only unit

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,110
left is pounds.

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,740
And if you do it this way,
you'll never get confused.

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,420
You'll know that the units
cancel out so you're getting

49
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,390
the right units.

50
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,370
But if you just think about it
in your mind, it should also

51
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,430
make sense.

52
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,600
If there are 2,000 pounds per
ton and there are 1 and 1/2

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,670
tons, I should multiply 1 and
1/2 times 2,000 to get the

54
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,460
number of pounds.

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,020
That makes sense.

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,860
And we know 1 and 1/2 times
2,000 is 3,000, but we'll

57
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,780
figure it out right here.

58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,110
So what is 3/2 times 2,000?

59
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,590
Well, I just told you answer.

60
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,130
We can actually simplify
it right over here.

61
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,920
This is going to be 3 times
2,000/2 pounds.

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,690
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

63
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,610
This will become 1,000, and this
will become 1, so it's 3

64
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,010
times 1,000 pounds, or this
is equal to 3,000 pounds.

65
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,980
So what we've done so far, we've
just figured out the

66
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,870
maximum capacity of
the elevator.

67
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,540
It can hold 1 and 1/2 tons,
which is the exact same thing

68
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,440
as 3,000 pounds.

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,010
Now, what we need to figure
out is 3,000 pounds is the

70
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,030
equivalent to how many average
adults of 160 pounds?

71
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,860
Or how many 160 pound people
would it take to weigh a total

72
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,320
of 3,000 pounds?

73
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,150
Well, we can just
divide by 160.

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,660
And if you want to make sure
that the units work out,

75
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,900
remember, we want our answer to
be in terms of people, and

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,060
we want the pounds
to cancel out.

77
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,130
So we have pounds in the
numerator here, so if we

78
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,050
divide by pounds, the pounds
will cancel out.

79
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,535
And then we want our leftover to
be people, or maybe person.

80
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,820
Person, people, same thing.

81
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,300
Let me do people.

82
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,620
The grammar of it, singular,
plural, might make it a little

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,260
confusing, but I think you
get the general idea.

84
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,750
Now, if we were to write this
out, what does it tell us?

85
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,130
1 person weighs 160 pounds, so
there's one person for every

86
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,060
160 pounds.

87
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,860
So notice, if we multiply these
two expressions, the

88
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,250
pounds will cancel out.

89
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,590
We'll be just left
with people.

90
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,520
We're multiplying 3,000 times
1/160, but it's really just

91
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,490
taking 3,000 and dividing by
160, which makes sense.

92
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,060
We have a capacity of 3,000.

93
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,370
Each of our people weighs
160 pounds.

94
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,080
Divide by 160.

95
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,240
It tells you how many people.

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,750
But this way, you know that
the units are working out.

97
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:47,620
So this is going to be equal
to 3,000/160 people.

98
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,340
That is the maximum capacity
of the elevator in terms of

99
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,550
average people.

100
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,280
Now, what is this?

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,170
Well, we can divide the
numerator and the

102
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,940
denominator by 10.

103
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,230
If we divide the numerator and
the denominator by 10, this

104
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,510
becomes 300/16.

105
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,990
If we divide 300 by 2,
this becomes 150.

106
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,840
If we divide 16 by 2,
this becomes 8.

107
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,620
Now, let's see, what can
we do more here?

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,760
We could divide by 2 again.

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,300
Let me rewrite it.

110
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,070
So this is the same thing
as 150/8 people.

111
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,290
150, we can divide by 2.

112
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,860
It gives us 75.

113
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,440
And if you take 8 divided
by 2, that is 4.

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,830
So we have 75 divided
by 4 people.

115
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,620
Let me just do that,
work it out.

116
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,700
So you have 75 divided by 4.

117
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,240
4 goes into 7 one time.

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,900
1 times 4 is 4.

119
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,200
You subtract.

120
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,840
7 minus 4 is 3.

121
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,620
Bring down this 5.

122
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,070
4 goes into 35 eight times.

123
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,560
8 times 4 is 32.

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,810
Subtract.

125
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,440
5 minutes 2 is 3.

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,630
And then you have the decimal.

127
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,520
We're going to the right
of the ones place.

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,650
We're going to the
tenths place now.

129
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,550
So we can bring down
a zero over here.

130
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,730
4 goes into 30 seven times.

131
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,890
7 times 4 is 28.

132
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,670
You subtract.

133
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,700
You get 2.

134
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,560
Bring down another zero.

135
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,250
4 goes into 20 exactly
five times.

136
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,770
5 times 4 is 20, and
then we are done.

137
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,610
So this expression is exactly--
the 3,000 divided by

138
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,740
160, or the 150 divided by 8,
the 75 divided by 4, it all

139
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,810
turns out to be 18.75
people is the

140
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,110
capacity of the elevator.

141
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,790
18.75 average 160-pound people
would weigh 3,000 pounds.

142
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,990
Now, do they want a decimal?

143
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,350
What is the maximum number of
adults who could safely ride

144
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,730
the elevator?

145
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,240
Well, if they're all going to
be average, then the maximum

146
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,210
number of adults, since you
can't have 3/4 of a person, or

147
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,860
75/100 of a person,
the maximum number

148
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,560
is going to be 18.

149
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
If you have 19 average-weight
adults, you are going to be

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,270
too heavy, and the elevator
will fall or something.

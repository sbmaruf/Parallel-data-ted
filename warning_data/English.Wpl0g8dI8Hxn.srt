So spill, what was that all about?

Nothing serious I think.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It looked like more then that to me, he got all googly eyed.

Here, at this table, talking to me like we're some kind of talking buddies?

I feel...

27

Well I didn't let him get that far.

Didn't anyone ever tell you the whole smelling people thing is a little gross.

I've killed people before.

And you're sure this isn't just some fanboy thing...

56

...cause I've fought more then a couple pimply overweight vamps who called themselves Lestat.

I wanted to kill you...

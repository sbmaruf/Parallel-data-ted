1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,610
Use less than or greater than
for this little brackets thing

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,800
to write a true sentence.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,920
So they essentially want us to
say whether 45.675 is greater

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,350
than or less than 45.645.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,060
So let's look at each
of these numbers.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,780
I'm just going to write them
on top of each other.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,090
So the first a number is
forty-five and six hundred and

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,610
seventy-five thousandths and
the second number is

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,730
forty-five and six hundred and
forty-five thousandths.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,920
Now when you look at everything
here, the only

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,670
place where these two numbers
are different is in the

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,130
hundredths place.

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,980
We have 7 hundredths here and
we have 4 hundredths here.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,790
Everything is the same,
so this number

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,750
is going to be greater.

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,580
This number is a greater than
45.645, or six-hundred and

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,960
forty-five thousandths.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,250
Let me write that down
just to make sure we

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:09,980
know what we're doing.

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,910
Forty-five and six hundred and
seventy-five thousandths, or

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:24,440
45.675, is definitely greater
than 45.645, or forty-five and

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,510
six hundred and forty-five
thousandths.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,399

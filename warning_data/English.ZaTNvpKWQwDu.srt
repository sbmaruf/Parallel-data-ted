1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,810
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,820
So where we had left off, we
said, OK, we have this angle

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,720
here, can we figure out if
any of these angles

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,930
are equal to it?

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,750
Well we know that alternate
interior angles on-- this is a

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,780
transversal line right here,
and these are parallel lines.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,940
So we know alternate interior.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,320
So this is an interior and it's
alternate interior is here.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,340
So we know they
equal each other.

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,520
I'm not going to draw it yet,
because sometimes if you forget

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,680
alternate interior you could
just remember, well,

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,460
corresponding angles
equal each other.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,410
So you could say that
that angle is also

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,880
equal to this angle.

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,460
And then you can use opposite
angles again to kind of get

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,660
back to the alternate interior.

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,490
I'll show you.

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,900
The great thing about math is
it's good for people who have

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,520
trouble memorizing things,
because you have to just

21
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,530
memorize a few things and
then everything else just

22
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,520
kind of falls out of it.

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,220
But anyway.

24
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,020
So we figured out that
this angle is the

25
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,440
same as this angle.

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:52,650
Right?

27
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,550
Because they're alternate
interior angles.

28
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,320
And this is its
corresponding side.

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,030
And then finally, what
about this angle here?

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,270
I'm going to draw
a triple angle.

31
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,640
One, two, three.

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,400
What is that one equal
to on this triangle?

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,230
Well, same reason.

34
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,990
Alternate interior angles of
two parallel lines-- and

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,420
remember, the only reason we
can kind of make this claim is

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,810
because I told you at the
beginning that this line right

37
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,030
here and this line right
here are parallel.

38
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,310
Right?

39
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,330
Otherwise, you couldn't
make this claim.

40
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,010
But since they are alternate
interior we know that

41
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,570
this is the same angle.

42
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,560
All right.

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,080
So we now have shown that
these are similar triangles.

44
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,630
And I didn't have to
do all three angles.

45
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,960
I could have just done two, and
that should have been good

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,380
enough for you to know
that they're similar.

47
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,180
Because if two are the
same then the third also

48
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,370
has to be the same.

49
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,740
And now let's see if we can
use this information to

50
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,980
figure out our ratios.

51
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,560
So let's see.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,040
Let's color the sides the
same side as the angle so

53
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,980
we don't get confused.

54
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,970
So this side is
the orange side.

55
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,800
Right?

56
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,810
This side is the blue.

57
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,390
This side is the red.

58
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,650
OK.

59
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,810
So we have everything
color coded.

60
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,320
And it might be confusing you
but it's useful, because, as

61
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,220
we'll see, these triangles are
actually kind of flipped.

62
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,290
So let's see what we can do.

63
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,470
So we need to figure out
this orange side here.

64
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,980
So this orange side
here, let's call it x.

65
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,850
So x equals question mark.

66
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,820
This orange side here
corresponds to this side here.

67
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,000
Right?

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,730
Because it's opposite
this angle, which is

69
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,090
equal to this angle.

70
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,760
So they're opposite
to the same angle.

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,940
So that's how we know they
correspond to each other.

72
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,960
So we could say x
over 6 is equal to.

73
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,260
And now, what other
sides do we know?

74
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,410
Well we know this side
here-- we know this 4 side.

75
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,240
Let me do it in that color.

76
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,310
We know this side is 4.

77
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,570
And since we've put x in the
numerator on the left-hand

78
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,070
side, and 4 is in the same
triangle as this x we're trying

79
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,900
to figure out, we'll put 4 in
the numerator on the

80
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,590
right-hand side.

81
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,250
4 over what?

82
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,880
Well what side
corresponds to 4?

83
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,290
What is opposite this
angle right here?

84
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,000
Well it's this angle.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,720

86
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,050
Right?

87
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,690
So the corresponding side of
this side is this side-- is 5.

88
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,310
And now we can solve.

89
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,010
x is equal-- we just
multiply both sides by 6.

90
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,310
So you get 24 over 5.

91
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,745
x is equal to 24 over 5.

92
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:38,760

93
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,040
Not too bad.

94
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,650
And then we could
even go further.

95
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,170
We can now figure out what
this side is right here.

96
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,770
This magenta side.

97
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,340
Let's call that,
I don't know, y.

98
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,000
Not too creative here.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,250
Well y corresponds
to this angle.

100
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,550
So y corresponds
to this 8 side.

101
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,060
Right?

102
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,120
So we could do y over 8 is
equal to-- oh, we could

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,680
do a bunch of things.

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,090
We could say 4 over 5 or we
could do-- let's do 4 over 5,

105
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,870
because we could do 24 over
5 over 6 and that's

106
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,520
kind of confusing.

107
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,980
So we could also do
that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

108
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,380
over 4 over 5.

109
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,000
Multiply both sides by 8.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,770
And you get y is equal
to 8 times 4, is what?

111
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,160
32 over 5.

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,980

113
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,825
And the reason why I did this
example is because I want

114
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,170
to show you that you
can't just eyeball.

115
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,860
Sometimes you can, if you get
good at it, but it's not always

116
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,710
completely obvious which sides
correspond to which sides.

117
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,612
It might have been tempting to
say that, I don't know, this

118
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,270
side corresponds to this
side or that this side

119
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,500
corresponds to this side.

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,150
But you really have to pay
attention to which side kind of

121
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,000
matches up with which angles.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,180
So any side that matches up
with a certain angle, that same

123
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,610
angle in the other triangle,
whatever side is opposite that,

124
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,300
that's its corresponding side.

125
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,800
I use a lot of words, but
hopefully you have a

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,670
bit of an intuition.

127
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,230
Let's do another one.

128
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,970
First, let's take a triangle
and prove to ourselves that the

129
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,160
two triangles are similar.

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,710

131
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,800
I like these parallel lines.

132
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,830
Let me do two parallel
lines again.

133
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,520
And then this time
around-- let's see.

134
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm going to draw.

135
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,450
There's a line.

136
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,300
There we go.

137
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,140

138
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,240
First, I said these
are parallel lines.

139
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,110
So let me mark them as such.

140
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,220
Parallel lines.

141
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,990
So what we want to do is we
want to prove that this

142
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:58,300
triangle right here is similar
to the bigger triangle-- is

143
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,310
similar to this triangle.

144
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,190
This is pretty interesting.

145
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,490
They actually overlap.

146
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:02,830
Right?

147
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,070

148
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,970
So first of all, do we know any
angles of the two triangles

149
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,420
that equal each other?

150
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,010
Well, sure.

151
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,880
They have this angle.

152
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,730
They actually both share the
same exact angle in common.

153
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,230
Right?

154
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,250
Because the two triangles
overlap at that point.

155
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
So what else can we figure out?

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,950
So let's see.

157
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,530
I mean, I don't to be
tacky without any

158
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,930
colors, but let's see.

159
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,550
We have this angle here.

160
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,470
And what other angles are
equal to this angle?

161
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,320
Well, we can use our parallel
lines and transversal of

162
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,350
angle rules, or theorems or
whatever, and figure it out.

163
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,860
Well this angle
corresponds to what?

164
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,620
Well, it corresponds
to this angle.

165
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,320
So it's equivalent.

166
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,750
And you got that from
your parallel lines.

167
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,090
Right?

168
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,000
So these two are the same.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,150
And then, finally, if I have--
let me pick a good color-- if I

170
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,550
have this angle, draw
a triple angle here.

171
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,110
Same thing.

172
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,610
This corresponding angle is
going to be right here.

173
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,250

174
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,830
So there.

175
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,450
We know all of the three angles
of this triangle are the same.

176
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,760
So this is a similar triangle.

177
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,540

178
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,780
Let's say we know that this
side right here-- I'll give

179
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,920
you a little trick question.

180
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,430
From here to here is 5.

181
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,530
And from here to here is 7.

182
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:41,250

183
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,825
From here to here is-- I
don't know; make up a

184
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:49,820
good number-- is 12.

185
00:07:49,820 --> 00:08:01,430
And from here to here
is, let me say, 6.

186
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,920
And I wanted to figure
out what this is.

187
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,080
How do we do that?

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
And I've further made it more
confusing by adding all

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,050
these squiggly lines.

190
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,460
Well, we already know
that these are two

191
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
similar triangles.

192
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,910
So we can use that information
to do our ratios.

193
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,110
So if we call this
is equal to x.

194
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,700
Right?

195
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,320
So what do we know?

196
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,350
We know that this whole side
corresponds to what side

197
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,250
on the smaller triangle?

198
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,580
Well, it corresponds
to this side.

199
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:34,820
Right?

200
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,085
It corresponds to here.

201
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,220
So let me draw it in
the correct color.

202
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,780
So if we do the orange, this
orange corresponds to this.

203
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,030
Right?

204
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,190
Well this orange corresponds
to the whole thing.

205
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,900
It corresponds to
this whole line.

206
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,770
So if we take the big
triangle, the big triangle

207
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,210
side is not just x.

208
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:54,490
Right?

209
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,875
Because that's not the whole
side of the triangle.

210
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,933
It's x plus 5.

211
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:00,850

212
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,060
That's this whole side.

213
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,450
Right?

214
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,116

215
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:11,340
x plus 5 over the corresponding
side on the smaller triangle.

216
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,660
Well, on the corresponding
side of the smaller

217
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,630
triangle it's just this.

218
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,610
It's over 5.

219
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,870
Right?

220
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,180
Is equal to-- and then
we could say, well, 12.

221
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,740
Is equal to 12, because this
corresponds to this angle

222
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,332
on the big triangle.

223
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:30,540
Is equal to 12 over what?

224
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,980
Over 6, because this is
the smaller triangle.

225
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,930
And then we could
solve for that.

226
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,900
This becomes 2.

227
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,860
Right?

228
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,936
You get x plus 5
is equal to 10.

229
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,530
x is equal to 5.

230
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,300
There you go.

231
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,560
That's all the time
I have for now.

232
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,540
I hope I helped you
understand similar triangles

233
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,580
just a little bit.

234
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,720
I'll see you soon.

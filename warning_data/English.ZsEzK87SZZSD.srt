1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
So let's generalize a bit
what we learned in the

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,830
last presentation.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,280
Let's say I'm
borrowing P dollars.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,790
P dollars, that's what I
borrowed so that's my

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,740
initial principal.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,728
So that's principal.

7
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:17,070
r is equal to the rate,
the interest rate that

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,310
I'm borrowing at.

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,600
We can also write that
as 100r%, right?

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,370
And I'm going to borrow
it for-- well, I

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,156
don't know-- t years.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,210
Let's see if we can come up
with equations to figure out

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,960
how much I'm going to owe at
the end of t years using either

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,170
simple or compound interest.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,450
So let's do simple first
because that's simple.

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:48,460
So at time 0-- so let's make
this the time axis-- how

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,310
much am I going to owe?

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,950
Well, that's right when I
borrow it, so if I paid

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,220
it back immediately, I
would just owe P, right?

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,730
At time 1, I owe P plus the
interest, plus you can kind of

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,460
view it as the rent on that
money, and that's r times P.

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,390
And that previously, in the
previous example, in the

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,900
previous video, was 10%.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,043
P was 100, so I had to pay $10
to borrow that money for a

25
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:13,265
year, and I had to
pay back $110.

26
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:18,610
And this is the same thing
as P times 1 plus r, right?

27
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,830
Because you could
just use 1P plus rP.

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,080
And then after two years,
how much do we owe?

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,190
Well, every year, we just
pay another rP, right?

30
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,860
In the previous example,
it was another $10.

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,000
So if this is 10%, every
year we just pay 10% of

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,360
our original principal.

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,730
So in year 2, we owe P plus
rP-- that's what we owed in

34
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,500
year 1-- and then another
rP, so that equals

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,350
P plus 1 plus 2r.

36
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,720
And just take the P out,
and you get a 1 plus r

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,840
plus r, so 1 plus 2r.

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,770
And then in year 3, we'd owe
what we owed in year 2.

39
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,330
So P plus rP plus rP, and then
we just pay another rP, another

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,830
say, you know, if r is 10%, or
50% of our original principal,

41
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,300
plus rP, and so that
equals P times 1 plus 3r.

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,910
So after t years,
how much do we owe?

43
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,815
Well, it's our original
principal times 1 plus,

44
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:22,330
and it'll be tr.

45
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,920
So you can distribute this out
because every year we pay Pr,

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,390
and there's going
to be t years.

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,970
And so that's why
it makes sense.

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,940
So if I were to say
I'm borrowing-- let's

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,410
do some numbers.

50
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,460
You could work it out this way,
and I recommend you do it.

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,100
You shouldn't just
memorize formulas.

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:45,820
If I were to borrow $50 at 15%
simple interest for 15-- or

53
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,700
let's say for 20 years, at the
end of the 20 years, I would

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:03:04,000
owe $50 times 1 plus the
time 20 times 0.15, right?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,960
And that's equal to $50 times 1
plus-- what's 20 times 0.15?

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,220
That's 3, right?

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,060
Right.

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,550
So it's 50 times 4, which
is equal to $200 to

59
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,740
borrow it for 20 years.

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,920
So $50 at 15% for 20
years results in a $200

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,700
payment at the end.

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,010
So this was simple
interest, and this was

63
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,370
the formula for it.

64
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,560
Let's see if we can do the same
thing with compound interest.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,108
Let me erase all this.

66
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,800
That's not how I
wanted to erase it.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,202
There we go.

68
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:53,430
OK, so with compound interest,
in year 1, it's the same thing,

69
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,020
really, as simple interest, and
we saw that in the

70
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,820
previous video.

71
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:04,810
I owe P plus, and now the rate
times P, and that equals

72
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,190
P times 1 plus r.

73
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,450
Fair enough.

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,810
Now year 2 is where compound
and simple interest diverge.

75
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,820
In simple interest, we would
just pay another rP, and

76
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,170
it becomes 1 plus 2r.

77
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,190
In compound interest,
this becomes the new

78
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,010
principal, right?

79
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,050
So if this is the new
principal, we are going to pay

80
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,370
1 plus r times this, right?

81
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,820
Our original principal was P.

82
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,000
After one year, we paid 1 plus
r times the original principal

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,270
times 1 plus r rate.

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,520
So to go into year 2, we're
going to pay what we owed at

85
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,640
the end of year 1, which is P
times 1 plus r, and then we're

86
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,640
going to grow that
by r percent.

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,240
So we're going to multiply
that again times 1 plus r.

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,900
And so that equals P
times 1 plus r squared.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,950
So the way you could think
about it, in simple interest,

90
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,170
every year we added a Pr.

91
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,330
In simple interest, we
added plus Pr every year.

92
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,760
So if this was $50 and this is
15%, every year we're adding

93
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,840
$3-- we're adding--
what was that?

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,460
50%.

95
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,520
We're adding $7.50 in interest,
where P is the principal,

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,560
r is the rate.

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,480
In compound interest, every
year we're multiplying the

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,680
principal times 1 plus
the rate, right?

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,930
So if we go to year 3,
we're going to multiply

100
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,230
this times 1 plus r.

101
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,090
So year 3 is P times 1
plus r to the third.

102
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,160
So year t is going to be
principal times 1 plus

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,240
r to the t-th power.

104
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,980
And so let's see
that same example.

105
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,870
We owe $200 in this example
with simple interest.

106
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,190
Let's see what we owe
in compound interest.

107
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,211
The principal is $50.

108
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,640
1 plus-- and what's the rate?

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,690
0.15.

110
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,180
And we're borrowing
it for 20 years.

111
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:14,910
So this is equal to 50 times
1.15 to the 20th power.

112
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,070
I know you can't read that,
but let me see what I can

113
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,680
do about the 20th power.

114
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:28,259
Let me use my Excel and
clear all of this.

115
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,840
Actually, I should just use my
mouse instead of the pen tool

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,950
to the clear everything.

117
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,770
OK, so let me just
pick a random point.

118
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,220
So I just want to-- plus 1.15
to the 20th power, and you

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,940
could use any calculator:
16.37, let's say.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:55,460
So this equals 50 times 16.37.

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,170
And what's 50 times that?

122
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:08,560
Plus 50 times that: $818.

123
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,780
So you've now realized that if
someone's giving you a loan and

124
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,320
they say, oh, yeah, I'll lend
you-- you need a 20-year loan?

125
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,340
I'm going to lend
it to you at 15%.

126
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,840
It's pretty important to
clarify whether they're going

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
to charge you 15% interest at
simple interest or

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,870
compound interest.

129
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,770
Because with compound interest,
you're going to end up paying--

130
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,900
I mean, look at this: just to
borrow $50, you're going to

131
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,180
be paying $618 more than if
this was simple interest.

132
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,480
Unfortunately, in the real
world, most of it is

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,690
compound interest.

134
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,250
And not only is it compounding,
but they don't even just

135
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,170
compound it every year and they
don't even just compound it

136
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,810
every six months, they actually
compound it continuously.

137
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,830
And so you should watch the
next several videos on

138
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,750
continuously compounding
interest, and then you'll

139
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,190
actually start to learn
about the magic of e.

140
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,202
Anyway, I'll see you
all in the next video.

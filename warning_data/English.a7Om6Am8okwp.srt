1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,360
Let's learn about matrices.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,800
What do I mean when
I say matrices?

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,430
Well, matrices is just the
plural for matrix, which is

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,810
probably a word you're familiar
with more because of

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,720
Hollywood than because
of mathematics.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,802
So what is a matrix?

8
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:20,120
Well, it's actually a
pretty simple idea.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,250
It's just a table of numbers,
that's all a matrix is.

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,740
So let me draw matrix for you.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,820
I don't like that
toothpaste-colored blue, so

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,230
let me use another color.

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,900
So this is an example
of a matrix.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,420

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,850
I'm going to pick some random
numbers out: 5, 1,

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,490
2, 3, 0, minus 5.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,980
That is a matrix.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,830
And all it is is a
table of numbers.

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,392
And often times if you wanted
to have a variable for a

20
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:52,530
matrix, you'd use a capital
letter, so you could use a

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,180
capital A, and sometimes in some
books, they make it extra

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,650
bold, so like a bold A
would be a matrix.

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,990
And just a little bit of
notation, so we would call

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,640
this matrix, just by convention,
you would call

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,950
this a 2-by-3 matrix.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,220
And sometimes they actually
write it, 2 by 3, below the

27
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,440
bold letter they use to
represent the matrix.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,300
And what is 2 and what is 3?

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,100
Well, 2 is the number of rows.

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,380
We have one row, two
rows, right?

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,080
This is a row.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,920
This is a row.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,310
And we have three columns:
one, two, three.

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,890
So that's why it's called
a 2-by-3 matrix.

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,250
If I said that B-- I'll do it
extra bold-- if B is a 5-by-2

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:43,610
matrix, that means that B would
have--- I'll just type

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,870
in numbers: 0, minus 5, 10.

38
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,620
So it has five rows and it has
two columns, so it'll have

39
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,420
another column here.

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,030
So let's see, minus 10, 3, I'm
just putting in random numbers

41
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,015
here-- 7, 2, pi.

42
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,930

43
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,930
That is a 5-by-2 matrix.

44
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,610
So I think you now have kind
of a convention that all a

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,300
matrix is is a table
of numbers.

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,780
You can represent it
when you're doing

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,760
it in variable form.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,010
You represent it as a boldface
capital letter.

49
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,910
Sometimes you'd write
a 2 by 3 there.

50
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,290
And, you can actually
reference the

51
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,900
terms of the matrix.

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,230
So in this example, in the top
example where we have matrix

53
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,780
A, if someone wanted to
reference this element of the

54
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,380
matrix, so what is that?

55
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,780
That is in the second row.

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,900
It's in row 2 and it's
in column 2, right?

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,910
This is column 1, this
is column 2.

58
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,520
This is row 1, row 2.

59
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,250
So it's in the second
row, second column.

60
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:51,470
So sometimes people will write
that A, and they'll write 2

61
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,500
comma 2 is equal to 0.

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,180
Or sometimes they'll write it as
a lowercase A 2 comma 2 is

63
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,430
equal to 0.

64
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,730

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,660
These are just the same thing.

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,250
I'm just doing this to expose
you to the notation, because a

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,080
lot of this really
is just notation.

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,710
So what is a 1 comma 3?

69
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,620
Well, that means we're in the
first row, the third column.

70
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,770
First row, one, two, three, it's
this value right here.

71
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,230
So that equals 2.

72
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,090
So this is just all notation
of what a matrix is.

73
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,025
It's a table of numbers that
can be represented this way

74
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:35,830
and we can represent it as
different elements that way.

75
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,250
So you might be asking, Sal,
well, that's nice.

76
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,040
A table of numbers with fancy
words and fancy notations, but

77
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,150
what is it good for?

78
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,250
And that's the interesting
point.

79
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,120
A matrix is just a data
representation.

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,550
It's just a way of writing
down data.

81
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,230
That's all it is.

82
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,890
it's a table of numbers, but it
can be used to represent a

83
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,180
whole set of phenomenon.

84
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,280
And if soon. you're doing this
in your Algebra I or your

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,560
Algebra II class, you're
probably using it to represent

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,620
linear equations.

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,490
But we'll learn later-- and I'll
do a whole set of videos

88
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,530
on applying matrices
to a whole bunch

89
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,140
of different things.

90
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,440
But it can represent-- it's very
powerful and if you're

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,459
doing computer graphics on a
matrix, the elements can

92
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,370
represent pixels
on your screen.

93
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,490
They can represent points
in coordinate space.

94
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,079
They can represent--
who knows?

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,880
There's tons of things that
they can represent.

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,700
But the important thing to
realize is that a matrix, it's

97
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,400
not a natural phenomenon.

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,100
It's not like a lot of the
mathematical concepts we've

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,710
been looking at.

100
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,570
It's a way to represent a
mathematical concept or a way

101
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,360
of representing values, but
you kind of have to define

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,920
what it's representing.

103
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,980
But let's put that on the back
burner a little bit in terms

104
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,380
of what it actually
represents.

105
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,430
Oh, my wife is here.

106
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,690
She's looking for our
filing cabinet.

107
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,870
But anyway, back to
what I was doing.

108
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,150
So let's put on the back
burner what a matrix is

109
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,230
actually representing and let's
learn the convention.

110
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,300
Because I think, at least
initially, that tends to be

111
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,960
the hardest part.

112
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,350
How do you add matrices?

113
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,880
How do you multiply matrices?

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,230
How do you invert matrices?

115
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,070
How do you find the determinant
of matrices?

116
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,430
All of those words might sound
unfamiliar unless you've

117
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,790
already been confused by them
in your algebra class.

118
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,140
I'm going to teach you all of
those things first, which are

119
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,850
all just really human-defined
conventions, and then later

120
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,450
on, I'll make a whole bunch of
videos on the intuition behind

121
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,550
them and what they actually
represent.

122
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,700
So let's get started.

123
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,680
So let's say I wanted to
add these two matrices.

124
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,920
Let's say the first one-- and
let me switch colors.

125
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll do relatively small ones,
just so as not to waste space.

126
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:45,320
Say I have the matrix
3, negative 1, 2 0.

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,170
Let's call that A, capital A.

128
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,360
Let's say matrix B, and I'm
just making up numbers.

129
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:05,330
Matrix B is equal to
minus 7, 2, 3, 5.

130
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:14,010
So my question to you is what
is A-- so I'm doing it bold

131
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,950
like they do in the textbooks--
plus matrix B?

132
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,210
So I'm adding two matrices.

133
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,310
And once again, this is
just human convention.

134
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,770
Someone defined how
matrices add.

135
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,530
They could've defined it some
other way, but they said we're

136
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,120
going to make matrices add the
way I'm about to show you,

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,460
because it's useful for a
whole set of phenomena.

138
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,620
So when you add two matrices,
you essentially just add the

139
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,060
corresponding elements.

140
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,900
So how does that work?

141
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,820
Well, you add the element that
is in row 1, column 1 to the

142
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,940
elements in row 1,
column 1, right?

143
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,700
So it's 3 plus minus 7.

144
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,460

145
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,560
That'll be the 1, 1 element.

146
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,230
Then the row 1, column
2 element will be

147
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,930
minus 1 plus 2.

148
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,380
Let me put parentheses around
them so you know these are

149
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,270
separate elements.

150
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,550
And you can guess how
this keeps going.

151
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:12,950
This element will be 2 plus
3 and this last element

152
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,200
will be 0 plus 5.

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,600

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,640
So that equals 3 plus minus 7.

155
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,196
That is minus 4.

156
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,690
Minus 1 plus 2, that's 1.

157
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,660
2 plus 3 is 5, and
0 plus 5 is 5.

158
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,820
So there we have it.

159
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,240
That is how we humans
have defined the

160
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,860
addition of two matrices.

161
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,170
And by this definition, you
could imagine that this is

162
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,560
going to be the same thing
as B plus A, right?

163
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
And remember, this is something
we have to think

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,180
about because we're not adding
numbers anymore.

165
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,550
You know 1 plus 2 is the same
thing you is 2 plus 1, or you

166
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,710
know any two normal numbers, it
doesn't matter what order

167
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,620
you add them in.

168
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,790
But with matrices, it's not
completely obvious.

169
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,070
But when you define it in this
way, it doesn't matter if we

170
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,620
do A plus B or B
plus A, right?

171
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,290
If we did B plus A, this would
just say negative 7 plus 3.

172
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,640
This would say 2 plus
negative 1.

173
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,270
But it would come out
to the same values.

174
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,890
That is matrix addition.

175
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,580
And you could imagine, matrix
subtraction, it's essentially

176
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,530
the same thing.

177
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,500
Well, actually let
me show you.

178
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,750
What would be A minus B?

179
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:26,820

180
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,670
Well, this is capital B with the
matrix, so I'm making it

181
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,240
extra bold.

182
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,370
Well, that's the same thing
as A plus minus 1 times B.

183
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,510
And what's B?

184
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,150
Well, B is minus 7, 2, 3, 5.

185
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,010
When you multiply a scalar,
when you just multiply a

186
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,260
number times a matrix, you just
multiply the number times

187
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,610
every one of it's elements.

188
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,160
So that equals A, matrix
A, plus the matrix.

189
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
We just multiply this negative 1
times every element in here.

190
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,330
So 7, minus 2, minus 3, and 5.

191
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,530
And then we can do what
we did up there.

192
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,870
And we know what A is, so this
would equal-- A is up here, so

193
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,340
3 plus 7 is 10.

194
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,940
Negative 1 plus negative 2 is
minus 3, 2 plus minus 3 is

195
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,625
minus 1, and 0 plus 5 is 5.

196
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,100
Now, you didn't even have
to go through this

197
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,820
exercise right here.

198
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,300
You could have literally just
subtracted these elements from

199
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,150
these elements, and you would
have gotten the same value.

200
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,780
I did this because I wanted to
show you also that multiplying

201
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,220
a scalar or just a value or a
number times a matrix is just

202
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,830
multiplying that number
times all of the

203
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,410
elements of the matrix.

204
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,350
And so by this definition
of matrix

205
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,770
addition, what do we know?

206
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,490
Well, we know that both matrices
have to be the same

207
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,250
size by this definition,
the way we're adding.

208
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,470
So, for example, you could
add these two matrices.

209
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:09,090
You could add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 to this matrix, to

210
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,120
minus 10, minus 100, minus
1000-- I'm making up numbers--

211
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,950
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1.

212
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,660
You can add these two
matrices, right?

213
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,980
Because they have the same
number of rows and same number

214
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,930
of columns.

215
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,040
So for example, if you were to
add them, the first term up

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,950
here would be 1 plus minus 10,
so it would be minus 9.

217
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,520
2 plus minus 100 is minus 98.

218
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,740
I think you get the point.

219
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,170
You would have exactly nine
elements and you would have

220
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,190
three rows and three columns.

221
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,550
But you could not add
these two matrices.

222
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,700
You could not add-- Let me do
it in a different color just

223
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,210
so it's different.

224
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,380
You could not add this blue.

225
00:10:49,380 --> 00:11:02,220
You could not add this matrix:
minus 3, 2 to the matrix 9, 7.

226
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,830
And why can you not add them?

227
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,590
Well, they don't have
corresponding

228
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,560
elements to add up.

229
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,710
This is a one row by two column,
this is 1 by 2, and

230
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,370
this is 2 by 1.

231
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,860
So they don't have the same
dimensions so we can't add or

232
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,700
subtract these matrices.

233
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,330
And this is a side note, when a
matrix has-- when one of its

234
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,850
dimensions is one-- so, for
example, here you have one row

235
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,090
and multiple columns, this is
actually called a row vector.

236
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,540
A vector is essentially a
one-dimensional matrix where

237
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,190
one of the dimensions is one.

238
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,270
So this is a row vector,
and similarly,

239
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,700
this is a column vector.

240
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,230
That's just a little extra
terminology you should know.

241
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,820
If you take linear algebra and
calculus, your professor might

242
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,810
use those terms and it's good
to be familiar with it.

243
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,840
But anyway, I'm pushing 11
minutes, so I will continue

244
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080
this in the next video.

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,330

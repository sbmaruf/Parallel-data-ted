1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,920
If x is a whole number, what
other sets does x belong to?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,060
And we saw a couple of videos
ago that I mentioned that the

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,070
notion of the set of
whole numbers is

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,750
a little bit ambiguous.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,560
Sometimes whole number means
non-negative integers.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,940
And sometimes it means
all integers.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,340
But in this context, and I
actually looked at what the

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,700
writers of this question are
looking for and the standards

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,590
that they care about.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,320
So from their point of view,
when they refer to whole

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,500
numbers, they're referring
to non-negative integers.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,310
So they're referring to 0, 1,
2, 3, so on and so forth.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,700
And I also looked at what they
referred to-- And remember,

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,800
this is just according to the
writers of this question.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,070
This isn't according to how
everyone views these things.

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,600
But they view natural numbers as
just the positive numbers.

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,500
I told you two videos ago that
some people view natural

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,650
numbers as just the positive,
but some people include 0 as a

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,350
natural number.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,730
But in this context it's just
the positive integers.

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,330
I shouldn't have said positive
numbers, I should have said

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,390
positive integers.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,120
It obviously doesn't
include the numbers

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,640
in between the integers.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,180
So natural are there the numbers
in this context.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,100
You'll see other contexts where
this would be described

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,930
as natural.

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,430
In this context the natural
numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, so on

29
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,110
and so forth.

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,430
And of course, there's no
ambiguity about what integers

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,480
are; everyone agrees on that.

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,910
Integers are-- you know, you
could go arbitrarily negative

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,790
and then negative 3, negative
2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,160
And you can just keep going
in the positive direction.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,350
So if x is a whole number, when
they say whole numbers

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,160
they mean it is non-negative.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,410
What other sets does
x belong to?

38
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,050
Well, if it's a whole number,
it's anyone of these numbers.

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,320
And all of these numbers
are also integers.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,690
The set of whole numbers, by the
convention they're using,

41
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,830
is this set right here.

42
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,240
It is a subset of integers.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,470
So we know that x is
also an integer.

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,780
x is also a member
of integers.

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,280
That means a member,
a member of a set.

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,370
x is also a member
of integers.

47
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,750
But it will not be a member of
natural numbers, or at least

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,560
the way that they've
defined it.

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,610
Because x could be 0.

50
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,010
0 is considered a whole number,
but if x were 0, it

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,560
would not be a member of
the natural numbers.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,780
So we can't say it's natural.

53
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,920
All we can say is, that it's
definitely integers, it's

54
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,860
definitely rational.

55
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,850
Because any whole number, you
can just divide it by 1 and

56
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,735
represent it as a fraction.

57
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:45,210
So x is a member of rationals.

58
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,710
And of course, it's also a
member of the real, which is

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,960
the broadest set that
we know of.

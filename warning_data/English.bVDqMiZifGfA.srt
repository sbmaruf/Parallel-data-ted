1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,690
I promised you that I'd give
you some more Pythagorean

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,720
theorem problems, so I will
now give you more Pythagorean

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,780
theorem problems.

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,790

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,382
And once again, this is
all about practice.

7
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:28,020
Let's say I had a triangle--
that's an ugly looking right

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:35,030
triangle, let me draw another
one --and if I were to tell

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,750
you that that side is 7, the
side is 6, and I want to

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,250
figure out this side.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,510
Well, we learned in the last
presentation: which of these

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,990
sides is the hypotenuse?

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,470
Well, here's the right angle,
so the side opposite the right

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,600
angle is the hypotenuse.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,120
So what we want to do
is actually figure

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,730
out the hypotenuse.

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,730
So we know that 6 squared
plus 7 squared is equal to

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,700
the hypotenuse squared.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,800
And in the Pythagorean theorem
they use C to represent the

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,470
hypotenuse, so we'll
use C here as well.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,930

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,030
And 36 plus 49 is
equal to C squared.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,150

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,510
85 is equal to C squared.

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,760
Or C is equal to the
square root of 85.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,490
And this is the part that most
people have trouble with, is

27
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,650
actually simplifying
the radical.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,290
So the square root of 85: can I
factor 85 so it's a product of

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,820
a perfect square and
another number?

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,920
85 isn't divisible by 4.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,350
So it won't be divisible by 16
or any of the multiples of 4.

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,400

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,940
5 goes into 85 how many times?

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,340
No, that's not perfect
square, either.

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,030
I don't think 85 can be
factored further as a

36
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,230
product of a perfect
square and another number.

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,980
So you might correct
me; I might be wrong.

38
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,570
This might be good exercise for
you to do later, but as far as

39
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,670
I can tell we have
gotten our answer.

40
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,070
The answer here is the
square root of 85.

41
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,250
And if we actually wanted to
estimate what that is, let's

42
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,810
think about it: the square root
of 81 is 9, and the square root

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,010
of 100 is 10 , so it's some
place in between 9 and 10, and

44
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,445
it's probably a little
bit closer to 9.

45
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:28,245
So it's 9 point something,
something, something.

46
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:30,260
And that's a good reality
check; that makes sense.

47
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,080
If this side is 6, this side
is 7, 9 point something,

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,270
something, something makes
sense for that length.

49
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,260
Let me give you
another problem.

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,790
[DRAWING]

51
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,250
Let's say that this is 10 .

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,300
This is 3.

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,090
What is this side?

54
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,060
First, let's identify
our hypotenuse.

55
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,680
We have our right angle here,
so the side opposite the right

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,230
angle is the hypotenuse and
it's also the longest side.

57
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,116
So it's 10.

58
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:05,390
So 10 squared is equal to
the sum of the squares

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,640
of the other two sides.

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,256
This is equal to 3 squared--
let's call this A.

61
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,890
Pick it arbitrarily.

62
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,380
--plus A squared.

63
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:23,860
Well, this is 100, is equal to
9 plus A squared, or A squared

64
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,720
is equal to 100 minus 9.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,560
A squared is equal to 91.

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,390

67
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,390
I don't think that can be
simplified further, either.

68
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,710
3 doesn't go into it.

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,950
I wonder, is 91 a prime number?

70
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm not sure.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,200
As far as I know, we're
done with this problem.

72
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,890
Let me give you another
problem, And actually, this

73
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,500
time I'm going to include one
extra step just to confuse you

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,240
because I think you're getting
this a little bit too easily.

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,805
Let's say I have a triangle.

76
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:05,130

77
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,990
And once again, we're dealing
all with right triangles now.

78
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,130
And never are you going to
attempt to use the Pythagorean

79
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,780
theorem unless you know for a
fact that's all right triangle.

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,130

81
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,810
But this example, we know
that this is right triangle.

82
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,050
If I would tell you the length
of this side is 5, and if our

83
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,810
tell you that this angle is 45
degrees, can we figure out the

84
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,410
other two sides of
this triangle?

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,220
Well, we can't use the
Pythagorean theorem directly

86
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,830
because the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that if have a right

87
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,750
triangle and we know two of the
sides that we can figure

88
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,140
out the third side.

89
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,320
Here we have a right
triangle and we only

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,870
know one of the sides.

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,080
So we can't figure out
the other two just yet.

92
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,330
But maybe we can use this extra
information right here, this 45

93
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,120
degrees, to figure out another
side, and then we'd be able

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
use the Pythagorean theorem.

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,810
Well, we know that the
angles in a triangle

96
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,860
add up to 180 degrees.

97
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,610
Well, hopefully you know
the angles in a triangle

98
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,630
add up to 180 degrees.

99
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,320
If you don't it's my fault
because I haven't taught

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,720
you that already.

101
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,310
So let's figure out what
the angles of this

102
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,080
triangle add up to.

103
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,410
Well, I mean we know they add
up to 180, but using that

104
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,790
information, we could figure
out what this angle is.

105
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,590
Because we know that this angle
is 90, this angle is 45.

106
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,340
So we say 45-- lets call this
angle x; I'm trying to make it

107
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,870
messy --45 plus 90--
this [INAUDIBLE]

108
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,720
is a 90 degree angle --plus
is equal to 180 degrees.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,520
And that's because the
angles in a triangle always

110
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,740
add up to 180 degrees.

111
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:55,970
So if we just solve for x, we
get 135 plus x is equal to 180.

112
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,550
Subtract 135 from both sides.

113
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,190
We get x is equal
to 45 degrees.

114
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,680
Interesting.

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,800
x is also 45 degrees.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,380
So we have a 90 degree angle
and two 45 degree angles.

117
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,710
Now I'm going to give you
another theorem that's not

118
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,920
named after the head
of a religion or the

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,560
founder of religion.

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,730
I actually don't think this
theorem doesn't have a name at.

121
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:26,920
All It's the fact that if I
have another triangle --I'm

122
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,980
going to draw another triangle
out here --where two of the

123
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,840
base angles are the same-- and
when I say base angle, I just

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,890
mean if these two angles are
the same, let's call it a.

125
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,770
They're both a --then the sides
that they don't share-- these

126
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,610
angles share this side, right?

127
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,560
--but if we look at the sides
that they don't share, we know

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,240
that these sides are equal.

129
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,810
I forgot what we call
this in geometry class.

130
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,270
Maybe I'll look it up in
another presentation;

131
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,960
I'll let you know.

132
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,040
But I got this far without
knowing what the name

133
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,370
of the theorem is.

134
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,170
And it makes sense; you don't
even need me to tell you that.

135
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,080

136
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,480
If I were to change one of
these angles, the length

137
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,660
would also change.

138
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,310
Or another way to think about
it, the only way-- no, I

139
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,350
don't confuse you too much.

140
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,820
But you can visually see that
if these two sides are the

141
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,670
same, then these two angles
are going to be the same.

142
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,430
If you changed one of these
sides' lengths, then the angles

143
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,660
will also change, or the angles
will not be equal anymore.

144
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,120
But I'll leave that for
you to think about.

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,320
But just take my word for it
right now that if two angles in

146
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,400
a triangle are equivalent, then
the sides that they don't share

147
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,690
are also equal in length.

148
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,820
Make sure you remember: not the
side that they share-- because

149
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,920
that can't be equal to anything
--it's the side that they don't

150
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,410
share are equal in length.

151
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,990
So here we have an example
where we have to equal angles.

152
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,020
They're both 45 degrees.

153
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,910
So that means that the sides
that they don't share-- this is

154
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,230
the side they share, right?

155
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,210
Both angle share this side --so
that means that the side that

156
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,080
they don't share are equal.

157
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,460
So this side is
equal to this side.

158
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,520
And I think you might be
experiencing an ah-hah

159
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,020
moment that right now.

160
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,380
Well this side is equal to this
side-- I gave you at the

161
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,050
beginning of this problem that
this side is equal to 5 --so

162
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,320
then we know that this
side is equal to 5.

163
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,920
And now we can do the
Pythagorean theorem.

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,750
We know this is the
hypotenuse, right?

165
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,940

166
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,180
So we can say 5 squared plus 5
squared is equal to-- let's say

167
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,950
C squared, where C is the
length of the hypotenuse --5

168
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,010
squared plus 5 squared-- that's
just 50 --is equal

169
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,110
to C squared.

170
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,370
And then we get C is equal
to the square root of 50.

171
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:56,250
And 50 is 2 times 25, so C is
equal to 5 square roots of 2.

172
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,220
Interesting.

173
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,110
So I think I might have given
you a lot of information there.

174
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,840
If you get confused, maybe you
want to re-watch this video.

175
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,630
But on the next video I'm
actually going to give you more

176
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,095
information about this type of
triangle, which is actually a

177
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,550
very common type of triangle
you'll see in geometry and

178
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,470
trigonometry 45,
45, 90 triangle.

179
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,930
And it makes sense why it's
called that because it has

180
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,930
45 degrees, 45 degrees,
and a 90 degree angle.

181
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,460
And I'll actually show you
a quick way of using that

182
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,920
information that it is a 45,
45, 90 degree triangle to

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,520
figure out the size if you're
given even one of the sides.

184
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,870
I hope I haven't confused you
too much, and I look forward

185
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,195
to seeing you in the
next presentation.

186
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,120
See you later.

187
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,974

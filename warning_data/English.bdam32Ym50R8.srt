00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,650
Find the volume of a sphere with
a diameter of 14 centimeters.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,520
So if I have a sphere-- so
this isn't just a circle,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,460
this is a sphere.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,350
You could view it as
a globe of some kind.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,180
So I'm going to shade
it a little bit so you

6
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:15,833
can tell that it's
three-dimensional.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,320
They're giving us the diameter.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,120
So if we go from one
side of the sphere

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,890
straight through
the center of it.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,430
So we're imagining that we
can see through the sphere.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,180
And we go straight
through the centimeter,

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,960
that distance right over
there is 14 centimeters.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,810
Now, to find the volume of a
sphere-- and we've proved this,

14
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,200
or you will see a proof for this
later when you learn calculus.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,480
But the formula for
the volume of a sphere

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,880
is volume is equal
to 4/3 pi r cubed,

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,410
where r is the
radius of the sphere.

18
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,781
So they've given
us the diameter.

19
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:54,285
And just like for circles,
the radius of the sphere

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,020
is half of the diameter.

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,440
So in this example, our radius
is going to be 7 centimeters.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,650
And in fact, the sphere
itself is the set

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,670
of all points in three
dimensions that is exactly

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,700
the radius away from the center.

25
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:09,374
But with that out of
the way, let's just

26
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,950
apply this radius being 7
centimeters to this formula

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,140
right over here.

28
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,540
So we're going to
have a volume is

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,920
equal to 4/3 pi times 7
centimeters to the third power.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,280
So I'll do that in
that pink color.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,090
So times 7 centimeters
to the third power.

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,430
And since it
already involves pi,

33
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,880
and you could
approximate pi with 3.14.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,180
Some people even
approximate it with 22/7.

35
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,104
But we'll actually just
get the calculator out

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,590
to get the exact
value for this volume.

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,870
So this is going to
be-- so my volume is

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,940
going to be 4 divided by 3.

39
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,900
And then I don't want
to just put a pi there,

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,640
because that might interpret
it as 4 divided by 3 pi.

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:07,420
So 4 divided by 3 times pi,
times 7 to the third power.

42
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,370
In order of operations,
it'll do the exponent

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,790
before it does the
multiplication,

44
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,676
so this should work out.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,650
And the units are going to be
in centimeters cubed or cubic

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,410
centimeters.

47
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,340
So we get 1,436.

48
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,010
They don't tell us
what to round it to.

49
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,590
So I'll just round it to
the nearest 10th-- 1,436.8.

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,750
So this is equal to
1,436.8 centimeters cubed.

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,580
And we're done.

1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's say we have
two lines over here.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,160
Let's call this line
right over here line AB.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,600
So A and B both
sit on this line.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,600
And let's say we have
this other line over here.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,410
We'll call this line CD.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,620
So it goes through point C
and it goes through point D.

7
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:18,232
And it just keeps
on going forever.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,020
And let's say that these lines
both sit on the same plane.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,930
And in this case, the
plane is our screen,

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,600
or this little piece
of paper that we're

11
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:27,016
looking at right over here.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,880
And they never intersect.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,230
So they're on the same
plane, but they never

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,180
intersect each other.

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,680
If those two things are
true, and when they're not

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,400
the same line, they
never intersect

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,320
and they can be
on the same plane,

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,000
then we say that these
lines are parallel.

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,400
They're moving in the
same general direction,

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,160
in fact, the exact
same general direction.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,540
If we were looking at it from
an algebraic point of view,

22
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:57,555
we would say that they
have the same slope,

23
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,200
but they have
different y-intercepts.

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,020
They involve different points.

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,520
If we drew our
coordinate axes here,

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,600
they would intersect that
at a different point,

27
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,589
but they would have
the same exact slope.

28
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,254
And what I want to
do is think about how

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,380
angles relate to parallel lines.

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,870
So right over here, we have
these two parallel lines.

31
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:24,240
We can say that line AB
is parallel to line CD.

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,700
Sometimes you'll
see it specified

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,130
on geometric drawings like this.

34
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,920
They'll put a little
arrow here to show

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,460
that these two
lines are parallel.

36
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,287
And if you've already
used the single arrow,

37
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,040
they might put a double arrow to
show that this line is parallel

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,250
to that line right over there.

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,420
Now with that out of the
way, what I want to do

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,750
is draw a line that intersects
both of these parallel lines.

41
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,100
So here's a line that
intersects both of them.

42
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,870
Let me draw a little
bit neater than that.

43
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,616
So let me draw that
line right over there.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,040
Well, actually, I'll do
some points over here.

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,950
Well, I'll just
call that line l.

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,030
And this line that intersects
both of these parallel lines,

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,370
we call that a transversal.

48
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,050
This is a transversal line.

49
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,970
It is transversing both
of these parallel lines.

50
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,410
This is a transversal.

51
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,790
And what I want to think about
is the angles that are formed,

52
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,210
and how they relate
to each other.

53
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,290
The angles that are
formed at the intersection

54
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,950
between this transversal line
and the two parallel lines.

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,600
So we could, first
of all, start off

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,820
with this angle right over here.

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,320
And we could call
that angle-- well,

58
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,530
if we made some labels
here, that would

59
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,100
be D, this point, and
then something else.

60
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,139
But I'll just call it this
angle right over here.

61
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,480
We know that that's going to be
equal to its vertical angles.

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,040
So this angle is
vertical with that one.

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,160
So it's going to be equal to
that angle right over there.

64
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,080
We also know that this
angle, right over here,

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,120
is going to be equal to its
vertical angle, or the angle

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,820
that is opposite
the intersection.

67
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,830
So it's going to
be equal to that.

68
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,370
And sometimes you'll
see it specified

69
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:00,521
like this, where you'll see a
double angle mark like that.

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,070
Or sometimes you'll
see someone write

71
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,760
this to show that
these two are equal

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,660
and these two are
equal right over here.

73
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,035
Now the other
thing we know is we

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,870
could do the exact
same exercise up here,

75
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,050
that these two are going
to be equal to each other

76
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,130
and these two are going
to be equal to each other.

77
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,313
They're all vertical angles.

78
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:24,130
What's interesting here is
thinking about the relationship

79
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,520
between that angle right
over there, and this angle

80
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,270
right up over here.

81
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,770
And if you just look at
it, it is actually obvious

82
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,000
what that relationship
is-- that they

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,550
are going to be the same
exact angle, that if you

84
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,127
put a protractor
here and measured it,

85
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,060
you would get the exact
same measure up here.

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,800
And if I drew
parallel lines-- maybe

87
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,340
I'll draw it straight
left and right,

88
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,651
it might be a little
bit more obvious.

89
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,320
So if I assume that these
two lines are parallel,

90
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,990
and I have a transversal
here, what I'm saying

91
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,970
is that this angle
is going to be

92
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,050
the exact same measure
as that angle there.

93
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,860
And to visualize that, just
imagine tilting this line.

94
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,920
And as you take
different-- so it

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,420
looks like it's the
case over there.

96
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,110
If you take the line like this
and you look at it over here,

97
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,110
it's clear that this
is equal to this.

98
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:10,726
And there's actually
no proof for this.

99
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,160
This is one of those
things that a mathematician

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,430
would say is intuitively
obvious, that if you look

101
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,805
at it, as you tilt
this line, you

102
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,870
would say that these
angles are the same.

103
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,580
Or think about putting
a protractor here

104
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,529
to actually measure
these angles.

105
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,490
If you put a
protractor here, you'd

106
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,730
have one side of the
angle at the zero degree,

107
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,820
and the other side would
specify that point.

108
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,590
And if you put the
protractor over here,

109
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,014
the exact same
thing would happen.

110
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,760
One side would be on
this parallel line,

111
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,910
and the other side would
point at the exact same point.

112
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,250
So given that, we
know that not only is

113
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,610
this side equivalent
to this side,

114
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,630
it is also equivalent
to this side over here.

115
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:53,054
And that tells us
that that's also

116
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,260
equivalent to that
side over there.

117
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,720
So all of these things
in green are equivalent.

118
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,760
And by the same exact
argument, this angle

119
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,150
is going to have the same
measure as this angle.

120
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,830
And that's going to be
the same as this angle,

121
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,220
because they are opposite,
or they're vertical angles.

122
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,770
Now the important
thing to realize

123
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,097
is just what we've deduced here.

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,330
The vertical angles are equal
and the corresponding angles

125
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,250
at the same points of
intersection are also equal.

126
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,625
And so that's a
new word that I'm

127
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,150
introducing right over here.

128
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,330
This angle and this
angle are corresponding.

129
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,680
They represent kind of
the top right corner,

130
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,450
in this example, of
where we intersected.

131
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,240
Here they represent still, I
guess, the top or the top right

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,530
corner of the intersection.

133
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,030
This would be the
top left corner.

134
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,180
They're always going to be
equal, corresponding angles.

135
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,730
And once again,
really, it's, I guess,

136
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,410
for lack of a better
word, it is a bit obvious.

137
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,300
Now on top of that,
there are other words

138
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,330
that people will see.

139
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,820
We've essentially just proven
that not only is this angle

140
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,730
equivalent to this
angle, but it's also

141
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,330
equivalent to this
angle right over here.

142
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,760
And these two angles--
let me label them

143
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,840
so that we can make
some headway here.

144
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,379
So I'm going to use
lowercase letters

145
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,910
for the angles themselves.

146
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,410
So let's call this lowercase
a, lowercase b, lowercase c.

147
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,590
So lowercase c for the
angle, lowercase d,

148
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,750
and then let me call
this e, f, g, h.

149
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,320
So we know from vertical
angles that b is equal to c.

150
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,450
But we also know
that b is equal to f

151
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,620
because they are
corresponding angles.

152
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,930
And that f is equal to g.

153
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,760
So vertical angles
are equivalent,

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,670
corresponding angles
are equivalent,

155
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,050
and so we also know, obviously,
that b is equal to g.

156
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,030
And so we say that alternate
interior angles are equivalent.

157
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,992
So you see that they're
kind of on the interior

158
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,640
of the intersection.

159
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,400
They're between the
two lines, but they're

160
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,830
on all opposite sides
of the transversal.

161
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,240
Now you don't have to
know that fancy word,

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,460
alternate interior
angles, you really just

163
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,350
have to deduce what
we just saw over here.

164
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,310
Know that vertical angles
are going to be equal

165
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,340
and corresponding angles
are going to be equal.

166
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,014
And you see it with
the other ones, too.

167
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,750
We know that a is going
to be equal to d, which

168
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:06,400
is going to be equal to h,
which is going to be equal to e.

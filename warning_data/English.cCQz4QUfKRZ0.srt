1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,570
In this video I'm going to do a
bunch of examples of finding

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,170
the equations of lines in
slope-intercept form.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,610
Just as a bit of a review, that
means equations of lines

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:17,050
in the form of y is equal to mx
plus b where m is the slope

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,200
and b is the y-intercept.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,870
So let's just do a bunch of
these problems. So here they

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,900
tell us that a line has a slope
of negative 5, so m is

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,740
equal to negative 5.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,290
And it has a y-intercept of 6.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,300
So b is equal to 6.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,985
So this is pretty
straightforward.

12
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:41,530
The equation of this line
is y is equal to

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,550
negative 5x plus 6.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,570
That wasn't too bad.

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,570
Let's do this next
one over here.

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,300
The line has a slope of negative
1 and contains the

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,320
point 4/5 comma 0.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,600
So they're telling us the slope,
slope of negative 1.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,230
So we know that m is equal to
negative 1, but we're not 100%

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,190
sure about where the y-intercept
is just yet.

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,510
So we know that this equation
is going to be of the form y

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,300
is equal to the slope negative
1x plus b, where b is the

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,460
y-intercept.

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,650
Now, we can use this coordinate
information, the

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,870
fact that it contains this
point, we can use that

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,590
information to solve for b.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,530
The fact that the line contains
this point means that

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,690
the value x is equal to 4/5, y
is equal to 0 must satisfy

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,265
this equation.

30
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:43,120
So let's substitute those in.
y is equal to 0 when x is

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,090
equal to 4/5.

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,170
So 0 is equal to negative
1 times 4/5 plus b.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,810
I'll scroll down a little bit.

34
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,110
So let's see, we get a 0 is
equal to negative 4/5 plus b.

35
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,040
We can add 4/5 to both sides
of this equation.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,250
So we get add a 4/5 there.

37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,320
We could add a 4/5 to
that side as well.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,100
The whole reason I did that is
so that cancels out with that.

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,130
You get b is equal to 4/5.

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,180
So we now have the equation
of the line.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,040
y is equal to negative 1 times
x, which we write as negative

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:32,500
x, plus b, which is 4/5,
just like that.

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,480
Now we have this one.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,580
The line contains the point
2 comma 6 and 5 comma 0.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,540
So they haven't given us the
slope or the y-intercept

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,030
explicitly.

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,350
But we could figure out both
of them from these

48
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,650
coordinates.

49
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,270
So the first thing we can do
is figure out the slope.

50
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,750
So we know that the slope m is
equal to change in y over

51
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,100
change in x, which is equal to--
What is the change in y?

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,490
Let's start with this
one right here.

53
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,985
So we do 6 minus 0.

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,070
Let me do it this way.

55
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,410
So that's a 6-- I want to make
it color-coded-- minus 0.

56
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,340
So 6 minus 0, that's
our change in y.

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:24,190
Our change in x is 2
minus 2 minus 5.

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,320
The reason why I color-coded
it is I wanted to show you

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,890
when I used this y term first,
I used the 6 up here, that I

60
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,380
have to use this x term
first as well.

61
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,730
So I wanted to show you, this
is the coordinate 2 comma 6.

62
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,590
This is the coordinate
5 comma 0.

63
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,650
I couldn't have swapped
the 2 and the 5 then.

64
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,030
Then I would have gotten the
negative of the answer.

65
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,080
But what do we get here?

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,210
This is equal to
6 minus 0 is 6.

67
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,770
2 minus 5 is negative 3.

68
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,910
So this becomes negative 6
over 3, which is the same

69
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,310
thing as negative 2.

70
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,250
So that's our slope.

71
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,920
So, so far we know that the line
must be, y is equal to

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,580
the slope-- I'll do that in
orange-- negative 2 times x

73
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,160
plus our y-intercept.

74
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,779
Now we can do exactly what we
did in the last problem.

75
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,579
We can use one of these
points to solve for b.

76
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,029
We can use either one.

77
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,920
Both of these are on the line,
so both of these must satisfy

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,900
this equation.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,800
I'll use the 5 comma 0 because
it's always nice when

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,020
you have a 0 there.

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,820
The math is a little
bit easier.

82
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,510
So let's put the 5
comma 0 there.

83
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,900
So y is equal to 0 when
x is equal to 5.

84
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,820
So y is equal to 0 when you have
negative 2 times 5, when

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,700
x is equal to 5 plus b.

86
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,650
So you get 0 is equal
to -10 plus b.

87
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,820
If you add 10 to both sides of
this equation, let's add 10 to

88
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,680
both sides, these
two cancel out.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,970
You get b is equal to
10 plus 0 or 10.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,420
So you get b is equal to 10.

91
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,935
Now we know the equation
for the line.

92
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:14,110
The equation is y-- let me do it
in a new color-- y is equal

93
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:22,280
to negative 2x plus b plus 10.

94
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,470
We are done.

95
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,720
Let's do another one of these.

96
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,270
All right, the line contains
the points 3 comma 5 and

97
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,890
negative 3 comma 0.

98
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,380
Just like the last problem, we
start by figuring out the

99
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,380
slope, which we will call m.

100
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,830
It's the same thing as the rise
over the run, which is

101
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,190
the same thing as the change
in y over the change in x.

102
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,070
If you were doing this for your
homework, you wouldn't

103
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,870
have to write all this.

104
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,920
I just want to make sure that
you understand that these are

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,150
all the same things.

106
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,520
Then what is our change in
y over our change in x?

107
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,280
This is equal to, let's start
with the side first. It's just

108
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,980
to show you I could pick
either of these points.

109
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:14,050
So let's say it's 0 minus
5 just like that.

110
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,000
So I'm using this coordinate
first. I'm kind of viewing it

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,770
as the endpoint.

112
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,420
Remember when I first learned
this, I would always be

113
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,160
tempted to do the x
in the numerator.

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,990
No, you use the y's
in the numerator.

115
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,470
So that's the second
of the coordinates.

116
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:38,435
That is going to be over
negative 3 minus 3.

117
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,370
This is the coordinate
negative 3, 0.

118
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,420
This is the coordinate 3, 5.

119
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,980
We're subtracting that.

120
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,310
So what are we going to get?

121
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,570
This is going to be equal to--
I'll do it in a neutral

122
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,210
color-- this is going to be
equal to the numerator is

123
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,010
negative 5 over negative 3
minus 3 is negative 6.

124
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,650
So the negatives cancel out.

125
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,930
You get 5/6.

126
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,700
So we know that the equation is
going to be of the form y

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,560
is equal to 5/6 x plus b.

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Now we can substitute one of
these coordinates in for b.

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
So let's do.

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,310
I always like to use the one
that has the 0 in it.

131
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:33,270
So y is a zero when x is
negative 3 plus b.

132
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,810
So all I did is I substituted
negative 3 for x, 0 for y.

133
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,860
I know I can do that because
this is on the line.

134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,040
This must satisfy the equation
of the line.

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,600
Let's solve for b.

136
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,990
So we get zero is equal to, well
if we divide negative 3

137
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,830
by 3, that becomes a 1.

138
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,890
If you divide 6 by 3,
that becomes a 2.

139
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:02,380
So it becomes negative
5/2 plus b.

140
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,280
We could add 5/2 to both
sides of the equation,

141
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,630
plus 5/2, plus 5/2.

142
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,850
I like to change my notation
just so you get

143
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,520
familiar with both.

144
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,800
So the equation becomes 5/2 is
equal to-- that's a 0-- is

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
equal to b.

146
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,090
b is 5/2.

147
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:31,940
So the equation of our line is
y is equal to 5/6 x plus b,

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,820
which we just figured out
is 5/2, plus 5/2.

149
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,710
We are done.

150
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,280
Let's do another one.

151
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,500
We have a graph here.

152
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
Let's figure out the equation
of this graph.

153
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,900
This is actually, on some level,
a little bit easier.

154
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,740
What's the slope?

155
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,250
Slope is change in y
over change it x.

156
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,310
So let's see what happens.

157
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,900
When we move in x, when our
change in x is 1, so that is

158
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,940
our change in x.

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,850
So change in x is 1.

160
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,130
I'm just deciding to change
my x by 1, increment by 1.

161
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,900
What is the change in y?

162
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,390
It looks like y changes
exactly by 4.

163
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,980
It looks like my delta y, my
change in y, is equal to 4

164
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,690
when my delta x is equal to 1.

165
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,340
So change in y over change in
x, change in y is 4 when

166
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,220
change in x is 1.

167
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,380
So the slope is equal to 4.

168
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,190
Now what's its y-intercept?

169
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,720
Well here we can just
look at the graph.

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,260
It looks like it intersects
y-axis at y is equal to

171
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,600
negative 6, or at the
point 0, negative 6.

172
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,180
So we know that b is equal
to negative 6.

173
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,875
So we know the equation
of the line.

174
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:56,630
The equation of the line is y is
equal to the slope times x

175
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,030
plus the y-intercept.

176
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,850
I should write that.

177
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,840
So minus 6, that is plus
negative 6 So that is the

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,800
equation of our line.

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,980
Let's do one more of these.

180
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,170
So they tell us that f of
1.5 is negative 3, f of

181
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,750
negative 1 is 2.

182
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,970
What is that?

183
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,830
Well, all this is just a fancy
way of telling you that the

184
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:30,530
point when x is 1.5, when you
put 1.5 into the function, the

185
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,490
function evaluates
as negative 3.

186
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,750
So this tells us that the
coordinate 1.5, negative 3 is

187
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,270
on the line.

188
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,960
Then this tells us that the
point when x is negative 1, f

189
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,420
of x is equal to 2.

190
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,540
This is just a fancy way of
saying that both of these two

191
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,400
points are on the line,
nothing unusual.

192
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,380
I think the point of this
problem is to get you familiar

193
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,870
with function notation, for you
to not get intimidated if

194
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,970
you see something like this.

195
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,540
If you evaluate the function
at 1.5, you get negative 3.

196
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,440
So that's the coordinate if
you imagine that y is

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,020
equal to f of x.

198
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,950
So this would be the
y-coordinate.

199
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,250
It would be equal to negative
3 when x is 1.5.

200
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,840
Anyway, I've said it
multiple times.

201
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,280
Let's figure out the
slope of this line.

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,020
The slope which is change in y
over change in x is equal to,

203
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:27,460
let's start with 2 minus this
guy, negative 3-- these are

204
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,880
the y-values-- over, all
of that over, negative

205
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,140
1 minus this guy.

206
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,330
Let me write it this way,
negative 1 minus

207
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,440
that guy, minus 1.5.

208
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,340
I do the colors because I want
to show you that the negative

209
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,060
1 and the 2 are both coming from
this, that's why I use

210
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,500
both of them first. If I used
these guys first, I would have

211
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,495
to use both the x and the y
first. If I use the 2 first, I

212
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:02,080
have to use the negative
1 first. That's why I'm

213
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,390
color-coding it.

214
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,360
So this is going to be equal
to 2 minus negative 3.

215
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,370
That's the same thing
as 2 plus 3.

216
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,620
So that is 5.

217
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,040
Negative 1 minus 1.5
is negative 2.5.

218
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,770
5 divided by 2.5
is equal to 2.

219
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,250
So the slope of this
line is negative 2.

220
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,130
Actually I'll take a little
aside to show you it doesn't

221
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,480
matter what order
I do this in.

222
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,180
If I use this coordinate first,
then I have to use that

223
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,140
coordinate first. Let's
do it the other way.

224
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:54,180
If I did it as negative 3
minus 2 over 1.5 minus

225
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,810
negative 1, this should be minus
the 2 over 1.5 minus the

226
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,060
negative 1.

227
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,780
This should give me
the same answer.

228
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,130
This is equal to what?

229
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,860
Negative 3 minus 2 is negative
5 over 1.5 minus negative 1.

230
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,520
That's 1.5 plus 1.

231
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,610
That's over 2.5.

232
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,840
So once again, this is
equal the negative 2.

233
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,340
So I just wanted to show you,
it doesn't matter which one

234
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,090
you pick as the starting or
the endpoint, as long as

235
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,980
you're consistent.

236
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,650
If this is the starting y,
this is the starting x.

237
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,370
If this is the finishing
y, this has to be

238
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,500
the finishing x.

239
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,100
But anyway, we know that the
slope is negative 2.

240
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,540
So we know the equation is y is
equal to negative 2x plus

241
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,170
some y-intercept.

242
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,720
Let's use one of these
coordinates.

243
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,430
I'll use this one since it
doesn't have a decimal in it.

244
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,450
So we know that y
is equal to 2.

245
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,630
So y is equal to 2 when x
is equal to negative 1.

246
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,290
Of course you have
your plus b.

247
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,710
So 2 is equal to negative 2
times negative 1 is 2 plus b.

248
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,390
If you subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, minus

249
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,370
2, minus 2, you're subtracting
it from both sides of this

250
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,480
equation, you're going to get
0 on the left-hand side is

251
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,520
equal to b.

252
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,670
So b is 0.

253
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,430
So the equation of our
line is just y is

254
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,680
equal to negative 2x.

255
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,870
Actually if you wanted to write
it in function notation,

256
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,190
it would be that f of x is
equal to negative 2x.

257
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,810
I kind of just assumed that
y is equal to f of x.

258
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,420
But this is really
the equation.

259
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,990
They never mentioned y's here.

260
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,890
So you could just write f of x
is equal to 2x right here.

261
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,190
Each of these coordinates
are the coordinates

262
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,610
of x and f of x.

263
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,960
So you could even view the
definition of slope as change

264
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,320
in f of x over change in x.

265
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,090
These are all equivalent ways
of viewing the same thing.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,930
Graph x is less than 4.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,350
So let's draw ourselves
a number line over here.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,755
So let me draw a number line.

5
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:12,580

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:20,220
I'll start here at 0,
so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,350
And we could go below 0.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,360
We'd have negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,590
I could keep going.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,950
Now, we want to graph all of
the x's that are less than 4,

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,370
but we're not including 4.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,250
It's not less than
or equal to 4.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,950
It's just less than 4.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,750
And to show that we're not
going to include 4, what we're

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,890
going to do is we're going
to draw a circle around 4.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,400
So this shows us that
we're not including 4.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,125
If we were including 4, I
would make that a solid dot.

18
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,960
And to show that we're going to
do all the values less than 4,

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,060
we want to shade
in the number line

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,045
below 4, going down
from 4, just like that.

21
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:02,380

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,050
And then we can just shade
in the arrow just like that.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,657
So this right here is all
of the values less than 4.

24
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:10,740
And you could test it out.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,080
Take any value
where there's blue.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,510
So there's blue over
here, negative 2.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,830
Negative 2 is
definitely less than 4.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,670
If you take this value
right here, this 2,

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,526
it's definitely less than 4.

30
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:27,720
4 is not included because
4 is not less than 4.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
It's equal to 4.

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,200
5 is not included because
5 is not less than 4.

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,830

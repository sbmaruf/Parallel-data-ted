How did you find out?

83
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:26,048
I read the messages on her phone.

84
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:31,068
And you?

85
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:35,002
I read his messages, too.

86
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:50,072
And the camera wasn't my husband's.

87
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:56,064
Excuse me...

88
00:18:56,064 --> 00:19:04,028
This may sound weird but...

89
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:20,008
Could I read your husband's messages?

90
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:23,036
Let's go away together.Can you take time off?

91
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,008
YOON Kyung-ho

00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,012
I'm filming us now...

00:19:54,012 --> 00:20:02,012
Don 't.

95
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:24,024
Stop filming...

96
00:20:24,024 --> 00:21:03,024
Don 't tickle me.

97
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:36,048
Maybe you should've just died.

98
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:38,096
Hey.

99
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,076

No.

103
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,076
Then let's go eat.

104
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:50,024
Are you staying the night?

105
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:53,036
No, there's a concert tomorrow.

106
00:21:53,036 --> 00:22:09,092
Thats right...

107
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:15,052
Gwang-il...

108
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:24,044
When I saw Su-jin at the hospital,

109
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:35,036
I wished that I'd beenhurt instead.

110
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:42,036
Don't worry.She'll be fine.

111
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:50,052
Right...

112
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:55,076
So, how are things with your wife?

113
00:22:55,076 --> 00:23:07,004
Good, I guess....

114
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:12,024
You think I'm pathetic,

115
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:16,052
don't you?

116
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:20,072
No.

117
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:34,012
Yeah, right...

118
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:38,004
Gwang-il...

120
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:55,044

121
00:23:55,044 --> 00:24:05,032
Sorry, man. Just go.

122
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:59,096
Please just go.

123
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:24,006
Bastard.

124
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:33,052
Hey.

125
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:38,002
Please...

126
00:25:38,002 --> 00:26:10,068
Open the door.

127
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:30,002
Please, I need to talk to you.

128
00:26:30,002 --> 00:27:38,084
Hey...

129
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:47,048
I... uhm...

130
00:27:47,048 --> 00:28:08,068
I'd like to apologize.

131
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:26,048
I'm very sorry.

132
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:28,028
- Oh, hello.- Hello.

133
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:35,052
Have a seat.

134
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:38,048
It won't be easy settling with them.

135
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:44,004
The victim was so young.

136
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:48,012
Since we don't knowwho was driving yet...

137
00:28:48,012 --> 00:30:13,044
It'd be best if you bothwent to his funeral.

138
00:30:13,044 --> 00:31:05,006
Do you want to wait here?

139
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:11,002
Are you friends of Young-ki?

140
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,092
No, the husband of the onein the accident.

141
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:29,072
I am very sorry.

142
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:33,036
Mother...

143
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:38,008
Who are you?

144
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:40,072
- I'm very sorry.- I'm very sorry.

145
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:44,096
I'm the wife of the onewho caused the accident.

146
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:54,008
You bitch!Bring back my brother!

147
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:56,052
Bring my brother back!Bastard!

148
00:31:56,052 --> 00:32:00,072
Stop it!

149
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:04,000
Just go.Please, just go.

150
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,032
I'm begging you.Just leave.

151
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:13,008
Please, go.

152
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:56,096
Please just leave.

153
00:32:56,096 --> 00:36:04,088
Please stop the car.

154
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:22,052
Sleep well.

155
00:36:22,052 --> 00:37:26,004
One, two, three.

156
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:34,008
Why'd you have to do it, Su-jin?

157
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:56,004
I just don't get it.

158
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:59,076
Throw away the sadness.

159
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,032
Good-bye!

160
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:03,048
Life is beautiful.

161
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,036
Singing!

162
00:38:06,036 --> 00:39:35,048
Throw away the sadness!

163
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:47,088
Would you like to try?

164
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:51,012
Are you an athlete?

165
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:53,000
Why do you ask?

166
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,004
Back therewhen you were throwing...

167
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:59,004
Oh, that.

168
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:03,096
No, I'm a lighting directorfor stages.

169
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:06,004
Like at concerts.

170
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:11,012
That sounds like fun.

171
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:14,004
It is when I'm setting it up,

172
00:40:14,004 --> 00:40:19,024
but it seems so futile afterwards.

173
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:26,024
But it's still funwhen you're setting up, right?

174
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:35,084
I guess.

175
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:39,064
What do you do?

176
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:44,064
Housework and chores.

177
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:50,028
That's a hard job.

178
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:54,044
Thank you for saying that...

179
00:40:54,044 --> 00:41:04,052
How did the two of you meet?

180
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:08,012
She came to take concert picturesduring college.

181
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:14,072
My wife used to bein a photography club.

182
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:26,024
What university didshe go to?

183
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:37,076
Joong-ang University.

184
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:46,096
Then, they must've beenin the same club.

185
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:49,016
Would you like some more?

186
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:59,084
I'll have the beer.

187
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:05,008
When do you feel happy?

188
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:07,032
When I sleep?

189
00:42:07,032 --> 00:42:18,032
Me, too.

190
00:42:18,032 --> 00:42:29,002
That hit the spot.

191
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:33,092
How did you two meet?

192
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:39,064
After I graduated,

193
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:45,044
My dad told meto get married early.

194
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:50,096
He set us up to meet.

195
00:42:50,096 --> 00:43:02,000
Things were so good then....

196
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,092
But I guess career womenare more attractive.

197
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:32,006
No, not really.

198
00:43:32,006 --> 00:43:40,012
I wish this was all a dream.

199
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:49,064
A dream...

200
00:43:49,064 --> 00:44:02,006
I don't know what I did wrong.

201
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:09,064
I hope he comes out of the coma.

202
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:28,084
So I can at leastget an explanation.

203
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:37,000
What will you do when she wakes up?

204
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:48,072
Get revenge.

205
00:44:48,072 --> 00:44:51,036
Should we have an affair?

206
00:44:51,036 --> 00:45:07,000
That'd make them flip.

207
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:58,092
I need to get some air.

208
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:23,012
Here you are.

209
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:26,036
Finished already?

210
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,006
Yes.

211
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:39,092
- Have some more.- It's okay.

212
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:43,092
Come in.

213
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,032
Hello.

214
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:46,056
Have you eaten?

215
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:47,008
Yes.

216
00:46:47,008 --> 00:46:49,008
So you're going to Seoul?

217
00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:51,092
Yes, for a few days.

218
00:46:51,092 --> 00:47:01,048
I see.

219
00:47:01,048 --> 00:47:03,032
Please take good care of her.

220
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:47,092
Sure.

221
00:47:47,092 --> 00:47:49,000
Hello.

222
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,084
Hi.

223
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:52,002
Are things going okay?

224
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,064
Yes.

225
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:55,000
I knew you could do it.

226
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,064
Thanks.

227
00:47:57,064 --> 00:48:18,068
Let's take it from the top.

228
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:22,004
Raise up the MR please.

229
00:48:22,004 --> 00:48:59,032
Okay.

230
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:05,044
Do you like to walk?

231
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:09,002
Yes, I do.

232
00:49:09,002 --> 00:49:12,008
Do you?

233
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:19,044
I do, too.

234
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:31,008
Doesn't it feel weird meetingin Seoul?

235
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:33,006
Aren't you cold?

236
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:38,032
Yes, aren't you?

237
00:49:38,032 --> 00:49:46,068
Just a little.

238
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:58,084
Should we go back?

239
00:49:58,084 --> 00:50:04,064
We came pretty far.

240
00:50:04,064 --> 00:52:38,072
If you're cold, should we run?

241
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:50,076
Please don't let it die.

242
00:52:50,076 --> 00:54:31,012
I'll take good care of it.

243
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:37,024
So, what should we do today?

244
00:54:37,024 --> 00:59:00,076
What would you like to do?

245
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:08,024
Are you always this quiet?

246
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:14,056
What's your favorite season?

247
00:59:14,056 --> 00:59:18,096
Spring.What about you, ln-su?

248
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:26,028
Well... I like winter.

249
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:31,002
I like the snow, too.

250
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:36,068
Then, I guess it should snowin spring.

251
00:59:36,068 --> 00:59:43,036
Think that'd ever happen?

252
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:50,000
Want to take a picture?

253
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,044
Never mind.

254
00:59:52,044 --> 01:00:08,024
Sure, why not?

255
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:09,004
Look here?

256
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:11,006
Yes.

257
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:38,056
One, two, three...

258
01:00:38,056 --> 01:02:32,072
Here, let me do it.

259
01:02:32,072 --> 01:02:33,088
Who is it?

260
01:02:33,088 --> 01:02:43,076
It's your father-in-law, son.

261
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:46,052
Yes, sir. Just a moment.

262
01:02:46,052 --> 01:03:27,012
Okay.

263
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:30,000
Hello, sir.

264
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,036
I didn't know you were coming.

265
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:34,004
Holding up okay?

266
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:36,004
Yes.

267
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:40,000
Ah... did you eat?

268
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,064
No, not yet.

269
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:46,064
I was just on my way outfor dinner.

270
01:03:46,064 --> 01:03:54,044
Wait here.

271
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:57,008
- Did you stop by the hospital?- Yes.

272
01:03:57,008 --> 01:03:59,096
Su-jin looks a lot better.

273
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:05,000
She does.

274
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,016
Ah, Dad?I think I forgot to lock the door.

275
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:10,068
I'll wait downstairs.

276
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:40,004
I'll be right down.

277
01:04:40,004 --> 01:09:07,016
I'm okay.

278
01:09:07,016 --> 01:09:19,016
Hello?

279
01:09:19,016 --> 01:10:06,072
Yes, I'll be right there.

280
01:10:06,072 --> 01:10:12,032
Su-jin.

281
01:10:12,032 --> 01:10:14,002
Su-jin.

282
01:10:14,002 --> 01:11:32,032
It might take a few weeksfor the patient to talk.

283
01:11:32,032 --> 01:11:35,056
You said you'd be back late.

284
01:11:35,056 --> 01:11:38,032
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

285
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:48,004
Okay.

286
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:54,076
I almost forgot, his blood pressurewent down this afternoon.

287
01:11:54,076 --> 01:13:26,004
Thank you...

288
01:13:26,004 --> 01:13:30,004
There is no big changein his vital signs...

289
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:34,092
But his bodily functionsare weakening.

290
01:13:34,092 --> 01:13:38,024
Do you want to transfer him to

291
01:13:38,024 --> 01:13:44,064
a bigger hospital in Seoul or stay?

292
01:13:44,064 --> 01:13:49,056
What should I do, doctor?

293
01:13:49,056 --> 01:14:09,056
It's up to you to decide.

294
01:14:09,056 --> 01:14:17,004
What about the womanin the accident with him?

295
01:14:17,004 --> 01:14:22,064
She'll be transferred to Seoul.

296
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:57,096
I see.

297
01:14:57,096 --> 01:17:10,016
You must be happy.Now you can both go back to Seoul.

298
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:14,016
Want to go out to eat?

299
01:17:14,016 --> 01:17:19,008
Not really.

300
01:17:19,008 --> 01:19:21,048
I'll wait.

301
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:29,076
I must be out of my mind.

302
01:19:29,076 --> 01:19:36,048
If we...

303
01:19:36,048 --> 01:19:52,048
met long ago or much later,what would we be?

304
01:19:52,048 --> 01:20:46,056
What will become of us?

305
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:50,064
Yes, it's me.

306
01:20:50,064 --> 01:20:59,048
No. Something came up.I can't make it back tonight.

307
01:20:59,048 --> 01:21:03,032
Is everything okay?

308
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:08,092
How's his blood pressure?

309
01:21:08,092 --> 01:21:13,012
I see...

310
01:21:13,012 --> 01:21:21,072
But something came up today.I can't make it back.

311
01:21:21,072 --> 01:21:27,072
I'll be there first thingin the morning.

312
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:35,092
Please take good care of him.Bye.

313
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:43,072
4, 7, 8, 9... 20.

314
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:49,044
...40. Square that all up

315
01:21:49,044 --> 01:21:51,088
and it comes to 1 60 points.

316
01:21:51,088 --> 01:21:54,036
Are you sure?Count it up again.

317
01:21:54,036 --> 01:22:00,006
It's right.Look, 3, 4. It's 7.

318
01:22:00,006 --> 01:22:54,084
7, 8...

319
01:22:54,084 --> 01:22:58,036
He passed away at 3:23 p.m.

320
01:22:58,036 --> 01:24:55,000
Would you like to goin and see him?

321
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,002

322

323
01:28:43,032 --> 01:28:47,032
Honey, I want a cigarette.

324
01:28:47,032 --> 01:29:19,068
Are you okay to smoke?

325
01:29:19,068 --> 01:29:27,088
Thank you, In-su...

326
01:29:27,088 --> 01:29:32,048
For what?

327
01:29:32,048 --> 01:30:26,004
For everything.

328
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:31,084
Last bus to Seoul!

329
01:30:31,084 --> 01:30:33,036

Thank you.

334

In-su, isn't there somethingyou want to ask me?

335
01:35:15,006 --> 01:35:26,024
How long are you goingto hold it back?

336
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:32,004
At first, I wanted to know...

337
01:35:32,004 --> 01:35:45,092
But not anymore.

338
01:35:45,092 --> 01:35:57,052
Su-jin...

339
01:35:57,052 --> 01:37:44,092
He died.

340
01:37:44,092 --> 01:37:46,068
Gwang-il.

341
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,012
Yes?

342
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:50,036
Check on the bank.

343
01:37:50,036 --> 01:38:04,008
Right on it, sir!

344
01:38:04,008 --> 01:38:05,092
Good.

345
01:38:05,092 --> 01:41:42,092
Okay.

346
01:41:42,092 --> 01:41:48,056
A great snow squall is fallingfar into spring.

00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,870
With Hangouts On Air, it's easy to broadcast
your Hangouts live to the world and record

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,910
them as YouTube videos.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,360
To begin, click “Start a Hangout”.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,430
Invite people to join your Hangout.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,969
Name your Hangout and click “Enable Hangouts
On Air”.

6
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:20,639
Review and agree to the legal terms to continue.
You only need to do this once.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
The first time you start a Hangout On Air,
we'll ask you to link your YouTube account

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,870
so we can record your Hangouts to your YouTube
channel.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,600
Click “Hangout.” Your Hangout will begin,
but don’t worry, you won’t be broadcasting

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,169
or recording just yet.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,010
Once you’re in the Hangout, adjust your
lighting and camera angle so you look your best.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,350
To stream your Hangout live on another website,
simply copy and paste the link to embed your Hangout.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,100
When you’re ready, click “Start broadcast”.
At this point, your Hangout is broadcasting

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,870
live on your Google+ profile, your YouTube
account and any website where you’ve embedded it.

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,630
While you’re broadcasting, your viewers
will see everything you see in the Hangout

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,440
except for your chat conversations

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,490
and the number of people who are watching
your broadcast.

18
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,359
You can mute people in your Hangout if their
background is noisy.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,949
Or click on a person’s video to make the
main screen stay on that person.

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,080
When you're done, a recording of your Hangout
will post publicly, so anyone who missed your

21
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,319
live Hangout can still join in the fun.

22
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,859
So go ahead. Start your first Hangout On Air
today and broadcast your conversation to the world.

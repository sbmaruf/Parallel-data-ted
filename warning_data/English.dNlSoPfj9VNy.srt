Episode 15

3
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,679
Everybody listen here!

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes ?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,006
I also have something to say.

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:16,333
Everyone please free your schedule on next Wednesday.

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,533
But... I'm going to play golf with Mr. Yoon on that day.

8
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,933
Ah, me too. I have to go somewhere with the shop workers on that day.

9
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,003
I can't either. I got invited to a birthday party.

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,000
Me too.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,153
Ah okay. Cancel it all.

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,133
Why? Why?

13
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,001
What's happening that day?

14
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,967
Your wedding.

15
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,005
W-w-wedding?!

16
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:41,633
Ah, please stop controlling us any which way you please.

17
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:44,067
Omo! Who's deciding?

18
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,008
You said you want to get married. I said after graduation!

19
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:52,000
When will that be? You have to become an intern, then a resident and you have to do your military service, too.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,002
What's the point of delaying? It's better to do it now, when you're still pretty and youthful.

21
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,679
But....

22
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,967
- The birthday party .... - Stop!

23
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,009
don't say anything else right now!

24
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,267
Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to reserve a wedding hall?

25
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:41,001
On that day, clear out all your schedules and you need to help each other out, alright?

26
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,733
You're still awake?

27
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:49,781
Ah... Yes.. .Yes.

28
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:53,133
What is it?

29
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,833
Did I go overboard by doing what I please?

30
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,233
That... that's not it.

31
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,209
We're living together anyway.

32
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:06,133
I thought they might as well be married, and it would look better in the eyes of others too.

33
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,009
Oh I see. Honestly that was bothering me a bit too.

34
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you for everything.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,001
But... Why are you like this? Your expression doesn't look good.

36
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:26,867
No, I'm doing good. It's just that I don't know what to start preparing first.

37
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:34,467
What is there to prepare?We already live together so there is nothing to buy, and the wedding hall has been booked.

38
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:38,006
We just need a dress and a ring, then everything will be fine.

39
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:44,004
Still...

40
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:46,067
Next Wednesday?!!!

41
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,667
Seung Jo's mother has some serious drive.

43
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:54,006
That's right.

44
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:58,967
Hey, did you guys cause some sort of accident?

45
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:03,003
Ya! It's not that!

46
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,005
Ah yes.

47
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:08,167
Does Bong Joon Gu knows?

48
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:13,006
Um... My dad has told him.

49
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:21,467
So that's why he looked so down in the dumps. He didn't even notice us when we came.

50
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,009
Hey, did you pick your dress?

51
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,233
You have to buy your ring too.

52
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:32,833
We have to start now. I'm busy.

53
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:39,001
Welc....

54
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:43,544
Sir!

55
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:44,833
Hey hurry and talk to me.

56
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,767
Hey, let's eat!

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,697
Eat well!

58
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:52,003
Sir, sir! A foreigner came! She is right over there, a foreigner!

59
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:52,933
Oh.

60
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,767
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

61
00:03:55,767 --> 00:04:03,833
Hurry!

62
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,833
Hi.

63
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,133
Hi.

64
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,567
Thank you.

65
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,005
Ha Ni, hurry up and take her order.

66
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,009
Me?

67
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,002
I can't speak English.

68
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:21,233
But, you're a college student. Hurry up!

69
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:21,867
Hi.

70
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,233
Hi.

71
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,533
How are you?

72
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:36,000
I . . . want to eat noodles! Please give me chopped noodles.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,967
She speaks korean very well.

74
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,867
What is it?

75
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,567
It's mushroom. Pine mushrooms.

76
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,833
Ah, pine mushrooms.

77
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:59,533
The scent . . . The scent is very nice!

78
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,167
She said pine mushrooms.

79
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,009
Her accent is so cute!

80
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,167
It's good for your health too.

81
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,003
This is called oyster.

82
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:14,967
Ah yes, oyster. I usually don't eat this.

83
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,367
This tastes good.

84
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,000
How do you speak Korean so well?

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,633
My mom is Korean, but my dad is English.

86
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,333
I came to Korea to see my mother's hometown.

87
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,002
I have to go home in 10 days.

88
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:34,367
Ah... yeah.

89
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,533
It's delicious. Very, very delicious.

90
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,006
That's stuffed cucumber kimchi.

91
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:45,533
That guy over there made it!

92
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:50,933
This tastes good! It's killer!

93
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,009
He is from Busan, so he's a little curt.

94
00:05:54,009 --> 00:06:17,867
Ah... Yes...

95
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,433
How was the one we saw before?

96
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,006
It's too showy.

97
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,967
Really ?

98
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,007
Then what about this one? This one is pretty.

99
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:31,267
I don't like it. It's too shiny.

100
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,004
Then, you choose it.

101
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:36,007
Hey! Do we have to get rings?

102
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:39,767
What are you talking about? It's a symbol of love.

103
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,004
A symbol of love?

104
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:45,467
Hey! How can something so materialistic be a symbol of love?

105
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,006
I'm not doing this!

106
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:50,008
No! You have to do it!

107
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:54,133
There needs to be a sign that you're a married man.

108
00:06:54,133 --> 00:07:23,833
So it's not really a symbol of love but more like shackles.

109
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,033
Forget it! What's there to buy when you only wear it that one day?

110
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,333
I have a suit already.

111
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,133
Still! Let's go in! I'm going to look for a dress.

112
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:35,667
Then go buy it and come back. I'll go somewhere and wait for you.

113
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,233
OK! Then, let's go to the studio.

114
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,633
Studio? Why?

115
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:44,233
Why? It's for the photo album shoot.

116
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,000
Photo album shoot?

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,267
Hey! I'm not doing that.

118
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,003
Husband look over here, bride smile a bit more...

119
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,967
You want me to do that silly thing?

120
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:53,009
Never.

121
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,033
This isn't fair. You don't want to match rings. You don't want to do the album photo shoot as well.

122
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,533
Why did you come out with me if you were going to be like this?

123
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,067
Do you think I came because I wanted to?

124
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,007
I came out just because they wanted me to.

125
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:07,767
Anyways, you came out. Can't you just put up with it and help?

126
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,004
You've only been irritated and saying you don't like this and that!

127
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,933
Hey. Why are you speaking like this in the street?

128
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,233
It's embarrassing.

129
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:17,633
Embarrassing? I'm embarrassed too!

130
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,833
What do you think the people at the rings store thought about us?

131
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,133
Why should I have to continually match your wants and needs?

132
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,002
Don't then.

133
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:30,233
If I don't... .What if I don't hold it in either?!

134
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:36,067
Now I see why couples break up before even getting married.

135
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:46,533
What?

136
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:51,267
I'm telling you now. Even after marrying you, I won't be able to just look to you.

137
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,267
I can't adjust myself for you.

138
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,233
When did you ever?

139
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,467
Really...

140
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,002
What's all this? It's because of my mom.

141
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:04,867
It's not because of Mother (in-law).

142
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:08,167
If so, why did you say you were going to marry me?

143
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:14,433
Yeah. I'm regretting why I said that.

144
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:29,933
I think we should think about it again.

145
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,006
Really?

146
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:36,567
So you weren't able to get your dress yet?

147
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:39,067
He doesn't even talk to me at home.

148
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,833
When we run into one another he avoids me.

149
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,667
What? There's not many days left...

150
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,067
He said he regrets asking me to marry him,

151
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:50,133
and that we should think it over.

152
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:54,000
No, you know how Baek Seung Jo is normally cold like that.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:16,325
Even if he says that, he doesn't mean it.

154
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,511
The business hours are over.

155
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,885
Oh, Seung Jo!

156
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:29,778
Come on in!

157
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:33,605
Have a seat.

158
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,645
You were reading a book?

159
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:39,078
From a dad to his daughter...

160
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,038
I wanted to talk to her about it.

161
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:45,494
What brought you here at this time?

162
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:55,778
I have something to tell you.

163
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,867
Doesn't it look beautiful?

164
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:02,831
It would be nice drinking coffee with those cups.

165
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:05,078
Yes, it looks beautiful.

166
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:08,145
Why does a bride-to-be's face look so upset?

167
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,978
Is Seung Jo being a pain?

168
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:12,544
No.

169
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:25,211
Wow, how beautiful.

170
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,145
Hey Dad.

171
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,931
Ha Ni, what are you doing?

172
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:33,231
Oh, is that so?

173
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:34,411
Then come here for a moment.

174
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,378
Now?

175
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:40,078
Why, did something happen?

176
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,111
Date?

177
00:11:44,111 --> 00:12:01,945
I understand. I'm coming now.

178
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:02,545
Dad..

179
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:19,811
Oh! Ha Ni.

180
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,938
Where are we going?

181
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:24,511
Where are we going, exactly?

182
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:33,017
You will find out once we get there.

Seung Jo wanted to greet your grandmother and mother.

185
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:26,278
I was busy so I forgot about it.

186
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,678
Nice to meet you, Mother.

187
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:34,511
Grandmother...

188
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,378
Your grandson-in-law is here.

189
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:42,278
Do you like it?

190
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:46,411
I'm worried because Oh Ha Ni isn't listening to me already,

191
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:48,578
but you don't have to worry.

192
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:53,711
I will take care of her.

193
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,278
I hate you.

194
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,445
Hate ?

195
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,911
I like it.

196
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:09,278
Thank you.

197
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,611

00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:14,445
Grandmom..

199
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:25,478
I'm getting married.

200
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,878
Kyung Soo sunbae is going to be the host.

201
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:33,111
Officiator. Let's not have an officiator.

202
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,745
What about our honeymoon?

203
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,278
Where are we going for our honeymoon?

204
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,245
Do we have to go? We don't have much time.

205
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,011
There you go again!

206
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,311
Fine, fine.

207
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:47,411
Where? Is there a place you would like to go?

208
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,478
Yes! Italy? Perhaps Rome!

209
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,111
Rome?

210
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:54,645
Rome? In your dreams.

211
00:14:54,645 --> 00:15:00,478
I was just joking. Even if it's not far away, I hope we go to an island.

212
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:02,645
Island. Okay then

213
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,245
Alright then.

214
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,411
How about Yeo Eui Do?

215
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,945
Yeo Eui Do?

216
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:09,311
Why?

217
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,445
Yeo Eui Do was once an island as well

218
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,411
Or...Bam Island?

219
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,278
Right!...Ddook I sland!

220
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,011
Ddook Island?!

221
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:23,345
How annoying.

222
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,878
Fine.

223
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,711
Let's determine with this.

224
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,378
If 3 of the same pictures appear after a shake...

225
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,278
we'll go to the place you wish.

226
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:33,845
Okay.

227
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,545
But isn't there only a small possibility?

228
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:39,445
No.

229
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,745
Jeju island, jeju island, jeju island.

230
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:42,278
Yeo Eui Do...

231
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,711
Jeju Island! Jeju Island!

232
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:50,511
It's Jeju Island. Wow!! Hooray!

233
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:55,745
Yes! Jeju Island!

234
00:15:55,745 --> 00:16:00,278
Yay!

235
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,945
Hurray!

236
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,311
How does it feel? It's tomorrow.

237
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,945
I don't know. It still hasn't hit me yet.

238
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,211
Have you packed your bag?

239
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:16,378
Yeah, just the basics.

240
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:19,011
Surprise!

241
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,045
What ,is it?

242
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,211
Open it.

243
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:23,745
Oh my.

244
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,445
Just rip it open, like this.

245
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:32,278
Okay.

246
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:33,111
Hey!!

247
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,678
What do you mean "Hey"?

248
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,778
We searched on the Internet.

249
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:42,878
They said that the most important thing on the honeymoon is underwear and nightwear.

250
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,745
And fragrance.

251
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,478
See. You take a shower first.

252
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:51,711
Seung Jo oppa!

253
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,445
Then you wear this underwear all sexy, like this.

254
00:16:55,445 --> 00:17:00,111
And you spray some of the fragrance.

255
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,245
Put on make up lightly as well.

256
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,911
When you take a shower, there is an important point.

257
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:04,445
What is it?

258
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:08,178
Never, ever, hum to yourself.

259
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:09,011
Why is that?

260
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:12,345
Men get scared when you are too powerful.

261
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,811
I see.

262
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:17,811
Hey, does Baek Seung Jo kiss well?

263
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:18,811
Hey!

264
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,545
- Tell me. - Does he kiss well?

265
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:21,611
Hey!

266
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:22,711
Was he good?! Was he good?!

267
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,178
How did he do it?!

268
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:29,611
Stop!

269
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:32,311
Here...

270
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,845
What is that?

271
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,578
It's just silverware and a china set.

272
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:39,545
Hey! Why did you buy this?

273
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:43,045
I hear even if you do nothing, this is something you have to do.

274
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:46,845
I also bought a set of blankets.

275
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,511
It's in the room, but I don't know if you'll like it.

276
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,311
Oh my!

277
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:53,878
In law, please look to us kindly!

278
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:55,045
Yes.

279
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:59,178
Please look to me kindly too, in law!

280
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:12,678
What to do.

281
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:16,845
Hyung.

282
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,278
Are you asleep?

283
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,645
No.

284
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:24,478
So you're eventually getting married to Oh Ha Ni.

285
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,178
It seems so.

286
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,311
Why, you don't like it?

287
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,245
Of course.

288
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:34,311
Oh Ha Ni isn't smart and she's clumsy.

289
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,211
More than anything, she's stupid.

290
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:42,178
Doesn't even know how to swim but tried to save me.

291
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:48,178
Even though you're mean to her, she smiles about liking you.

292
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:55,011
I'm going to marry a girl much smarter and prettier than Oh Ha Ni.

293
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,111
Okay.

294
00:18:56,111 --> 00:19:00,611
But, I'm all for Hyung and Oh Ha Ni getting married.

295
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:04,178
I like you very much,

296
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:09,545
but to be honest, it is quite true that your personality has a few issues.

297
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:14,578
And so, I think that you should marry a person like Oh Ha Ni.

298
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:52,578
You're doing the right thing. Congrats.

299
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,478
Ha Ni,

300
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:59,111
I'm really happy right now,

301
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:07,878
because you're probably really happy right now.

302
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:14,378
When you're happy,

303
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:17,445
I'm happy as well.

304
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:21,711
Congratulations, Oh Ha Ni.

305
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,845
Have beautiful dreams

306
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:51,979

308
00:20:53,601 --> 00:21:25,077

00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,728
Do you want to practice?

336
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,311
Oh..

337
00:23:50,311 --> 00:24:06,632
Yeah.

338
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:08,411
S....s...

339
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:47,081
Ready, start.

340
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:53,835
Aigoo.

341
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:56,123
Hello. Hello.

342
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,609
You must be very happy to get a new daughter-in-law.

343
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,712
This is my son.

344
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:02,424
Congratulations.

345
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:04,949
I hear you're working on a new business.

346
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:07,568
- Oh sir you're here!-Congratulations.

347
00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:09,155
- I need to come even if I'm busy!- Oh thank yoU!

348
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:13,344
One, two, three!

349
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,043
Me too!

350
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:17,133
-Min Ah, Min Ah come here!- Stand next to Ju Ri.

351
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,177
I'll be compared to Min Ah then.

352
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:23,437
I'm going to take it!

353
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:26,067
Teacher!

354
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,577
Teacher.

355
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:29,244
Hi!

356
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:32,077
Congratulations, Ha Ni!

357
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:35,777
Congratulations.

358
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:41,521
You are pregnant?

359
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:43,811
What happened to you!??

360
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:46,348
It's embarrassing!

361
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:48,055
Ha Ni, congratulations!

362
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:51,944
Marrying with Seung Jo, you're epic!!

363
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:53,711
You've succeeded!

364
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:55,075
You've done it!

365
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,839
Ha Ni, see you later.

366
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,295
Thank you for coming.

367
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:00,745
You look pretty!

368
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:02,893
Ha Ni, congratulations!

369
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,612
You look really beautiful!

370
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:07,744
Teachers getting married is pretty epic too.

371
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:23,177
Did you see that? You will one day get pregnant, too Won't you?

372
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:24,877
You look pretty.

373
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,744
You too.

374
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:29,244
I feel good that it's you.

375
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:31,635
Hmm?

376
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:37,576
I feel good that Baek Seung Jo chose you, not me.

377
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,977
Yeah. This is why I like him.

378
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:43,477
I'm thinking like that.

379
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,477
It's hard.

380
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,011
What's hard?

381
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:48,377
Baek Seung Jo has good taste in girls.

382
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,477
That's what I mean.

383
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,011
Hae Ra.

384
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,665
Be happy,

385
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:56,177
so I become jealous and marry quickly.

386
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:58,187
Okay, I'll try hard.

387
00:26:58,187 --> 00:26:59,711
Don't try hard.

388
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:02,077
I feel scared when you say that you're going to try hard.

389
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:04,877
Oh Ha Ni's patience and perseverance...

390
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:06,941
To top that off if Oh Ha Ni tries hard too...

391
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:08,777
Everyone's dead...

392
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:13,444
All right.

393
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:16,811
Congratulations.

394
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,344
Thank you.

395
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:32,844
See you later.

396
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,649
You came?

397
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,977
Ya, you look happy. You're smiling very wide.

398
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:39,944
Your mouth looks like it's going to rip.

399
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,736
You look good.

400
00:27:41,736 --> 00:27:43,677
Of course.

401
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:48,577
Be careful, Ha Ni might change her mind after seeing me.

402
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:52,811
I could run away with her.

403
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:55,056
Ladies and gentlemen.

404
00:27:55,056 --> 00:28:03,156
Soon, bridegroom Baek Seung Jo and the bride Oh Ha Ni's wedding will start.

405
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:04,811
What do I do, Eun Jo?

406
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:06,077
It's going to start.

407
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:08,211
Are you nervous?

408
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:11,989
Don't make mistakes again,

409
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:15,577
whether you drop the ring or you step on your own dress and slip.

410
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:16,877
Hey.

411
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:20,411
Don't say things like that.

412
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:21,677
Do you want

413
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:24,744
me to give you a wedding present?

414
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,377
Gift?

415
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:27,644
Yeah. What is it?

416
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:34,927
Give me your ears.

417
00:28:34,927 --> 00:29:46,544
What?!

418
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:51,277
Ah, as you see, there's no officiator in this wedding,

419
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:57,877
so we'll have the two of them doing their own officiating.

420
00:29:57,877 --> 00:30:05,144
Start.

421
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:06,811
I, Baek Seung Jo,

422
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:11,344
will respect and love my bride, Oh Ha Ni, whatever it takes,

423
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,211
will respect the elders,

424
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,611
will be a good husband to her,

425
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:19,377
I promise.

426
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:20,644
I, Oh Ha Ni,

427
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:22,811
with groom Baek Seung Jo,

428
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:26,377
will love and respect forever whatever it takes.

429
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:35,444
I promise I will respect the elders, and be a good wife to him.

430
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:40,477
This bride's dad is a very old friend of mine.

431
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:45,644
Until junior high, it was as if I lived at his house.

432
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,644
He's done a lot for me.

433
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:53,377
It was like that back then, and it was like that once we met again too.

434
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:59,094
I always thought that there couldn't be a warmer and nicer person than him.

435
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:06,544
This amazing friend of mine has now become my in law.

436
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:08,411
My friend,

437
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:13,887
thank you for letting your well raised daughter marry my son.

438
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:18,153
After thinking about what I should say,

439
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:22,487
I remembered my short married life.

440
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:28,787
On our wedding day, it snowed a lot.

441
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:34,032
And on Christmas eve, while we were eating the leftover noodles,

442
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:38,067
we said "Merry Christmas"

443
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:39,987
to each other.

444
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:45,853
After that, Ha Ni came and my wife passed.

445
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:51,002
I was holding Ha Ni and crying.

446
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:54,042
I remembered all that.

447
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:59,387
It doesn't seem like such a big deal, but I was very happy.

448
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:06,002
It was probably because of the hardships we endured together.

449
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:12,987
Like how my mother-in-law would call her Noah's snail all the time.

450
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:20,853
She knew what road to take, and she is a child who took that road smiling.

451
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:28,853
I was always sad and sorry about her being alone.

452
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:36,052
From today, since a caring and cool groom is going with her,

453
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:42,187
my heart is put at ease and I'm reassured.

454
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:45,853
Thank you, Seung Jo.

455
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:56,787
Go with Ha Ni to the end.

456
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:59,953
It is time for the ring exchange.

457
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:37,062
Groom and bride, please exchange rings.

458
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:42,082
What to do?

459
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:57,012
Here it is!

460
00:33:57,012 --> 00:34:02,052
Thank you.

461
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:05,022
Dummy.

462
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:07,072
Don't tease me, Baek Seung Jo,

463
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:10,287
when you actually like me a lot,

464
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,052
starting from a long time ago too.

465
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,253
What?

466
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,032
What are you talking about?

467
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:20,072
The second kiss. Instead of in the rain, it was at the pension wasn't it?

468
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:27,887
I was sleeping, how childish.

469
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:32,062
After doing that, being so coy.

470
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:50,022


471
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:52,053
What is this?

472
00:34:52,053 --> 00:35:00,453
Everyone, the bride is really bold!

473
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:05,053
Look at you now.

474
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:32,032
Everyone let's give the bride and groom a round of applause!

475
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:35,153
Wow! It's so cool!

476
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:38,062
Can we get out and see the ocean for a little while and then go?

477
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:55,853
Let's see it and go, huh? Let's see the ocean and go!

478
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,042
It's so pretty!

479
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:59,753
Look at the color of the ocean.

480
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:07,092
It's really pretty, isn't it?

481
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:10,072
I feel like I've come to the South Pacific.

482
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:16,853
How can the ocean be that blue?

483
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:19,002
What?

484
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:21,815
Are you still mad?

485
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:23,022
If you're done looking, let's go.

486
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:28,953
The growing of our two lovebirds, the bride and groom,

487
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,187
has been prepared through a video.

488
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:46,087
Please continue eating the food in front of you, and let's appreciate this together.

489
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:51,253
Since she was a baby, her beauty was different from others

490
00:36:51,253 --> 00:37:07,853
This child, grew up to be a man over there.

491
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,453
Is that hyung?!

492
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,187
Right.

493
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,082
That's hyung.

494
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:18,653
I feel so much better. From now on, I don't think I can live holding a secret.

495
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,187
Seung Jo, you live lightly too from now on.

496
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:25,353
Carefree!

497
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:28,853
Mother-in-law, really. She went overboard.

498
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:33,887
Even though she was well aware of your temper.

499
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:35,187
Hey! Where are you going?!

500
00:37:35,187 --> 00:38:03,042
Hey! Stop there! Hey, Baek Seung Jo!!

501
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,072
How long are you going to keep on following me?

502
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:08,953
Ah, about that...

503
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,587
Hae Ra!

504
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:14,012
Are you not hungry?

505
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:20,012
I noticed earlier that you hadn't eaten anything.

506
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:23,053
Do you want me to buy you food?

507
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:37,753

508
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:42,653
It's different from the hotel that I thought of. It's really pretty.

509
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,012
We're over there.

510
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,062
Oh, how frustrating!

511
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:48,453
What kind of man has so little strength?

512
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:52,453
I'm sorry.

513
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:56,787
Oh, what's up with this? Are you staying here?

514
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:58,353
Do you not remember?

515
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:03,453
We sat next to each other on the plane.

516
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:04,052
Ah, yes.

517
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,853
Ah, check-in. Check-in!

518
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:07,653
Oh okay.

519
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:10,082
Couldn't even find the hotel gate. Making me come in through the back.

520
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:13,853
Ah, I'm really going to go crazy.

521
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:17,953
I didn't notice while I was sitting next to you earlier, but you're really handsome.

522
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,052
You could be an actor!

523
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:21,012
Ah, then we'll be leaving first.

524
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:25,953
Let's go.

525
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:32,253
Oh, excuse me!

526
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,253
You must really like hot dogs.

527
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:38,871
Do you not like hot dogs that much?

528
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,153
Should we go eat something else?

529
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:42,032
No, it's okay.

530
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:49,652
Please eat.

531
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:53,012
Do you want me to tell you something fun?

532
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:54,042
Eye booger.

533
00:39:54,042 --> 00:40:07,487
What?

534
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:10,587
What is this?

535
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:15,187
What is this? Hot Dog Eating Competition.

536
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:19,587
If you can eat 30 in ten minutes, you qualify for the competition in New York.

537
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:22,053
They can go to New York.

538
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,082
Between the ages of 20 and 40.

539
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:28,887
I can do it, I'm 21. Right, right?

540
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,092
Hey this...

541
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:33,032
Hae Ra, Hae Ra!

542
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:37,022
If it's 30 hotdogs in 10 minutes, then it's 1 hotdog per 20 seconds.

543
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:40,487
It can't be done? I think it's possible.

544
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:41,062
You're going to do it?

545
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:44,042
I should go for things like that.

546
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:52,553
I get to eat a lot of hot dogs, I get to go to New York, and I win, the prize which will probably be really big.

547
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:58,753
If I win and get a prize, I'll buy you yummy stuff.

548
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:00,052
Let's practice.

549
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:02,953
I'll eat this.

550
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:05,553
Count from 1 to 20 okay.

551
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:13,484
1... 2...

552
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:19,287
You laughed.

553
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:22,092
Did you not get sick that day?

554
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:28,022
You practiced tennis real hard for a long time.

555
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,387
I don't get sick over something like that.

556
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:33,353
What do you mean something like that? You practiced for four hours.

557
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:40,687
You were there for four hours, sunbae?

558
00:41:40,687 --> 00:41:51,927
Let's eat... hotdog.

559

It's so nice here.

561
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,353
And the ocean is right in front of our noses.

562
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:44,919
It is really beautiful!

563
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:48,707
Excuse me...

564
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:53,186
I'll try hard.

565
00:42:53,186 --> 00:42:57,253
I know I'm not that great with a lot of things,

566
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:59,019
but I'll try!

567
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:12,119
I'll be a good wife.

568
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,819
<i>Oh, what do I do!

569
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:15,986
<i>The environment seems so good.

570
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:17,419
Oh!

571
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:20,019
Ah, you're in that room.

572
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:23,119
Our room is over there.

573
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,463
It is really fate!

574
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:33,994
What is this candle light event?

575
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:38,837
It's our hotel's most popular program for newlyweds on their honeymoon.

576
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:42,019
You should be pretty pleased with just the meal alone.

577
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,753
The feedback is really good.

578
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:47,086
Grilled pork, eel, and lobster marinade.

579
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:53,743
Caesar salad as well as live music and picture service.

580
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:55,253
Should we try this?

581
00:43:55,253 --> 00:43:59,219
On a weekday like today we have a wonderful wine service that's on the house.

582
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,486
Really?

583
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:03,886
A candle light dinner and free wine too?!

584
00:44:03,886 --> 00:44:05,519
It is good.

585
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,586
What do you think?

586
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:09,323
Alright, we'll take this for our dinner tonight.

587
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:10,079
Yes, I got it.

588
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,323
We'll contact your room as soon as it's ready.

589
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:15,956
All you have to do is come to the restaurant next to the pond.

590
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:17,623
Yes.

591
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:22,823
There's only 1 other couple that requested this aside from you. Seeing there's only 2 couples it should be quite cozy.

592
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:33,523
There's another honeymoon couple?

593
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:35,823
Oh my goodness!

594
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:39,691
I heard there was an event the hotel prepared for honeymooning couples.

595
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:42,496
I thought it was going to be real lame.

596
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:44,436
Isn't it really romantic?!

597
00:44:44,436 --> 00:44:50,056
Our fates are really entwined, don't you think?

598
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:52,723
We should have just come together from the airport.

599
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,003
We had a really hard time finding it.

600
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:57,256
I'm not too good with roads.

601
00:44:57,256 --> 00:45:00,242
Is that all?!

602
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,079
But both of you look young.

603
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,823
Yes, we're 21.

604
00:45:06,823 --> 00:45:08,623
Oh we're the same age!

605
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,156
It is really our fate!

606
00:45:11,156 --> 00:45:14,823
But you got married real early.

607
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:15,856
Yes well...

608
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:19,856
Shotgun wedding?

609
00:45:19,856 --> 00:45:28,089
We're 11 years apart, but it looks more doesn't it?

610
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:33,006
- Please have some.- Yes.

611
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:35,523
You're even good at pouring wine.

612
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:40,123
Since we're the same age shall we talk informally?

613
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:48,223
Do as you wish.

614
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:53,039
Are you taking a shot?!

615
00:45:53,039 --> 00:46:03,923
I don't know too much about drinking wine.

616
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:08,124
Ah, slowly!Slowly!

617
00:46:08,124 --> 00:46:09,963
I think I'm going to throw up.

618
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:24,596
Why did you drink so much?

619
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:25,663
Are you alright?

620
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:52,022


621
00:46:52,022 --> 00:47:00,196
Here you go pork chopped noodles.

622
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:01,496
Ah!

623
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:04,023
Give me a fork please!

624
00:47:04,023 --> 00:47:05,005
A fork?

625
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:07,264
Do you think this is spaghetti?!

626
00:47:07,264 --> 00:47:11,396
There's a way to eat all foods. Noodles like this

627
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,049
you use chopsticks and go whoosh whoosh.

628
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:15,478
You need to eat it like that to get the full taste!

629
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:17,656
Here.

630
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:19,596
I don't know how to use chopsticks.

631
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:21,263
Didn't you say your mother is Korean?

632
00:47:21,263 --> 00:47:25,896
Haven't you learned how to use chopsticks?

633
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:27,496
Look!

634
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:29,563
Chopsticks...

635
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:31,663
You need to know the fundamentals. Fundamentals, okay?

636
00:47:31,663 --> 00:47:32,663
Do you know what fundamentals are?

637
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:35,343
What?

638
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:40,236
You place the chopstick like this and you only add pressure to here and here.

639
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:42,419
And the other one you hang it off of here.

640
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:44,996
And you just move this one like this.

641
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:48,496
Where in the world are you looking when I'm here explaining it to you?

642
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:51,073
Here. Not like that, over here.

643
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:52,863
-Here, here!-Here!

644
00:47:52,863 --> 00:48:00,053
That's right.

645
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:03,033
Wow the building looks unique.

646
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:06,038
They made it after the Great Mosque of Djenné.

647
00:48:06,038 --> 00:48:08,003
Djenné?

648
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:11,076
It's an Islamic mosque in western Africa.

649
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:14,093
It's the biggest adobe building in the world.

650
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:17,043
Oh adobe.

651
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:18,386
Wow!

652
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:21,996
How could they build such a big building with adobe?

653
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:24,963
Once a year they paint the adobe.

654
00:48:24,963 --> 00:48:27,096
You see that thing sticking out?

655
00:48:27,096 --> 00:48:27,766
Yes.

656
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:29,263
They step on that to climb up--

657
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:31,896
Oh I see.

658
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:34,003
How do you know so much, Seung Jo?

659
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:37,033
Is it because you are a medical student? It'll be fun if we go around together.

660
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:39,528
I'm going to follow you around like crazy.

661
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:42,076
Ah! Are you alright?

662
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:45,093
Do you know you downed two bottles of wine all on your own last night?

663
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:49,896
Ah! Really?

664
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:53,163
That's really interesting, right?

665
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,033
Look at this! It's so pretty.

666
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:03,296
Right?

667
00:49:03,296 --> 00:49:06,023
I am sorry!

668
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:07,996
Over there, over there!

669
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:09,392
Hurry!

670
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:11,615
This place is so fun!

671
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:23,857
Over there! Should we go over there?

672
00:49:23,857 --> 00:49:25,292
Look here!

673
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:26,399
Yes!

674
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:29,925
If you're the husband, take care of your wife!

675
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,659
Why am I stuck in this situation because of your wife?!

676
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:34,692
I am sorry , Miss Ha Ni!

677
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:37,692
Truthfully, I am worried too.

678
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:40,659
Seung Jo is after my wife.

679
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:42,125
What?

680
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,063
Seung Jo?

681
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:49,259
Seung Jo isn't into women like that! Especially ones that force themselves like that.

682
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:51,225
Women like that?!

683
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:55,825
Force herself?! My Hyun Ah is friendly and very affectionate.

684
00:49:55,825 --> 00:50:01,465
She's misunderstood like that a lot, but she's a genuinely nice girl.

685
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:05,271
She's too good for me!

686
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:06,865
Omo!

687
00:50:06,865 --> 00:50:15,725
Those two match really well.

688
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:19,225
Once we're done here do you want to head to the other museum?

689
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,992
I hear it's totally fun there.

690
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:22,496
Let's go to see!

691
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:23,592
Let's go!

692
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:51,425
-Oh, I am sorry!-What is this?

693
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:54,559
Wow! It is really cute!

694
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,205
Should we buy this for Eun Jo?

695
00:51:00,205 --> 00:51:05,659
I don't think we need to buy it for him. Put it down.

696
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:07,625
Did you see me looking at you?!

697
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:08,459
Oh, really!

698
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:10,025
I'm here now!

699
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:23,659
Then you should have dressed better! What in the world is this?!

700
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:26,559
We went to so many places today.

701
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,259
I don't know how many museums we went to.

702
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:32,892
Aren't you tired?

703
00:51:32,892 --> 00:51:38,159
You had to drive too.

704
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:40,425
Want to wash up first?

705
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:43,525
Oh!

706
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:56,959
Shall I?

707
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:58,525
What do I do!

708
00:51:58,525 --> 00:52:00,825
The time has finally come.

709
00:52:00,825 --> 00:52:12,825
What to do?

710
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:14,259
Who is it?

711
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:17,425
It is me. Open the door, please.

712
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:22,159
What is it?

713
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:37,049
Let's have some champagne. This is really good stuff.

714
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:41,099
<i>Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viiikii.net

715
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,634
Hello.

716
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:48,023
You're a bit late. Would you like a glass of wine?

717
00:52:48,023 --> 00:52:49,009
That's okay.

718
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:55,023
Have a nice time

719
00:52:55,023 --> 00:53:00,057
Today's the last day.

720
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,423
What is this?

721
00:53:01,423 --> 00:53:03,009
We haven't even been able to take a single picture yet.

722
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:06,023
You probably don't have to worry about that.

723
00:53:06,023 --> 00:53:07,059
Huh?

724
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:14,223
Why?

725
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:21,557
I didn't have time to be with you, only us two.

726
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:28,089
So, let's hang around with only us two for today, okay?

727
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:29,842
Okay.

728
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:49,049
Truly?

729
00:53:49,049 --> 00:53:51,457
I look pretty!

730
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:57,523
This is why he married me I guess

731
00:53:57,523 --> 00:54:01,757
Seung Jo. Seung Jo.

732
00:54:01,757 --> 00:54:02,019
What is it? Who is it?

733
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:11,157
I wonder.

734
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:18,757
Seung Jo. Please help.

735
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:21,757
It hurts. It hurts.

736
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:24,123
Where does it hurt?

737
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:27,423
I don't know. It hurts all over.

738
00:54:27,423 --> 00:54:28,079
Hyun Ah...

739
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,857
Just hold on.

740
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:36,049
Is it here?

741
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:39,757
No, I don't think it's over there.

742
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:45,657
Then, here?

743
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,456
Here?

744
00:54:46,456 --> 00:54:48,757
<i>No, don't touch her.

745
00:54:48,757 --> 00:54:49,657
<i>Stop.

746
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:51,357
How about here?

747
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:53,557
Here, this is where it hurts.

748
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:55,059
Stop It!

749
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,523
Don't touch a woman like that!

750
00:54:57,523 --> 00:55:00,023
Oh Ha Ni. What are you doing now?

751
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:02,257
I don't like it

752
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,557
when you touch some other woman's body.

753
00:55:04,557 --> 00:55:05,423
I don't like that.

754
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:11,069
Oh Ha Ni! You married a person that's going to be become a doctor.

755
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:14,457
What are you going to do if you're jealous of a sick person?

756
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:16,823
Because I've touched them?!

757
00:55:16,823 --> 00:55:19,423
Aren't you even embarrassed?

758
00:55:19,423 --> 00:55:23,957
If you don't like it, then you cannot live with me.

759
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:27,857
Do you understand?

760
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,957
Miss Ha Ni!

761
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:34,089
Hurry up and go follow her.

762
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:36,257
What the!

763
00:55:36,257 --> 00:55:43,039
Gospodična Ha Ni!

764
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,029
Finally, its only us two.

765
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:50,757
Seung Jo, you don't like Ha Ni right?

766
00:55:50,757 --> 00:55:53,857
You don't want to touch her either, do you?

767
00:55:53,857 --> 00:55:58,089
How unfortunate. You should have met me before Ha Ni.

768
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:02,525
If that's the case,

769
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,039
Then,

770
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,523
I wouldn't have even glanced at you probably.

771
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:07,223
What?

772
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:12,123
I have no choice but to deal with you because of where we are right now.

773
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:22,109
Don't you dare compare something like you to Ha Ni.

774
00:56:22,109 --> 00:57:06,523
I couldn't catch her.

775
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:16,657
I thought you wanted it to be just the two of us? So why are you leaving on your own?

776
00:57:16,657 --> 00:57:21,057
Are you still angry?

777
00:57:21,057 --> 00:57:24,557
Put yourself in my shoes.

778
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:27,079
It would be weird not to get angry.

779
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:36,157
But you're pretty when you smile.

780
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:47,923
When you smile I start to feel good.

781
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,029
It tickles!

782
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:53,357
Hey, stop it!

783
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:54,757
Don't!

784
00:57:54,757 --> 00:57:56,423
Don't!

785
00:57:56,423 --> 00:58:22,323
I'm sorry

786
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:26,029
I'm sorry.

787
00:58:26,029 --> 00:58:30,323
That I acted stupid.

788
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:36,257
Getting jealous at those things...

789
00:58:36,257 --> 00:58:43,157
Dork.

790
00:58:43,157 --> 00:58:46,857
You're cute.

791
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:51,069
Every now and then.

792
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:55,257
There are also times when you're beautiful.

793
00:58:55,257 --> 00:59:00,823
From time to time.

794
00:59:00,823 --> 00:59:02,823
But ...

795
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:06,523
Why do I like you?

796
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:12,257
You're not that pretty and you're only cute now and then.

797
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:19,057
Why would I always miss you?

798
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:21,857
You...

799
00:59:21,857 --> 01:00:00,069
What did you do to me?

800
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:03,523
Hey...

801
01:00:03,523 --> 01:00:07,049
Wait a minute...

802
01:00:07,049 --> 01:00:12,019
I have something to prepare...

803
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:13,957
Prepare what?

804
01:00:13,957 --> 01:00:16,123
See...

805
01:00:16,123 --> 01:00:18,623
A girl has things to prepare--

806
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:20,123
It's fine.

807
01:00:20,123 --> 01:02:01,057
I can't wait any longer.

808
01:02:01,057 --> 01:02:02,857
Good morning!

809
01:02:02,857 --> 01:02:05,557
Why? You should have slept more.

810
01:02:05,557 --> 01:02:06,657
You must be tired.

811
01:02:06,657 --> 01:02:07,089
I'm sorry.

812
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:11,049
What happened? The alarm went off at 5am.

813
01:02:11,049 --> 01:02:14,059
I was looking forward to what you would make for breakfast.

814
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:19,023
Hyung you can rethink all this.

815
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:21,049
Ha Ni, you sit down too.

816
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:22,079
Do you want to wash up before you eat?

817
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,057
Yes.

818
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:24,923
I'm sorry.

819
01:02:24,923 --> 01:02:26,099
Absolutely no need for that!

820
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:30,049
You're going to the library, right? I'll be quick so lets go together.

821
01:02:30,049 --> 01:02:33,057
Going to study to get into the nursing program?

822
01:02:33,057 --> 01:02:34,019
Yes.

823
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:40,423
The son will be a doctor and the daughter-in-law a nurse. That's so great!

824
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:45,557
Well I can't take the certification until I get into the program.

825
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,557
If I don't then I may not be able to take it at all.

826
01:02:47,557 --> 01:02:48,323
Oh really?!

827
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:50,257
Just because she takes it doesn't mean she's going to pass.

828
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:51,079
She's better off not being able to take it.

829
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:54,059
Baek Eun Jo fix that mouth of yours!

830
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:57,039
She's your sister-in-law now.

831
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,069
Oh that's right! We have to register your marriage!

832
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:00,957
Well...

833
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:02,857
What kind of reply is that?

834
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:06,019
I know you're busy, but there are priorities you know!

835
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:08,723
Hey Ha Ni later go with Seung Jo and--

836
01:03:08,723 --> 01:03:12,089
I'll think about it first.

837
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,557
What?! Think about what?!

838
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,157
About putting her on our family register.

839
01:03:17,157 --> 01:03:18,557
I want to wait and see.

840
01:03:18,557 --> 01:03:21,079
Is that something to say for someone that just came back from their honeymoon?!

841
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:24,039
That was something that you forced on us, Mother.

842
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:27,357
Baek Seung Jo does any of this make any sense?!

843
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:29,657
Thank God Ha Ni's father isn't here!

844
01:03:29,657 --> 01:03:32,039
What is it that you want to think over?

845
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:34,029
Well...

846
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:38,323
I don't know but something isn't right at all.

847
01:03:38,323 --> 01:03:41,029
It just feels like we're rushing through it all.

848
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:43,523
You don't want that either right?

849
01:03:43,523 --> 01:03:45,257
Is that so...

850
01:03:45,257 --> 01:03:48,019
Then what do we do?

851
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:51,323
Changing your major to nursing.

852
01:03:51,323 --> 01:03:54,059
Let's register once you pass the test to change majors.

853
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:56,019
What does that have to do with your marriage registration?!

854
01:03:56,019 --> 01:03:57,059
No way!

855
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:01,257
What? Are you not confident?

856
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:02,657
You jumped into it and this is it?

857
01:04:02,657 --> 01:04:07,957
No that's not it. There's a chance I may not be able to take it at all!

858
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:32,457
I'm sure it'll happen, some day.

859
01:04:32,457 --> 01:04:44,657
<i>Thanks to the amazing PKer team for all their hard work today. Thank you to all the viewers who waited until the channel went green for GO to watch this episode.

860
01:04:44,657 --> 01:04:45,457
What?

861
01:04:45,457 --> 01:04:47,957
You won't put me on your family register until I pass?!

862
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:49,657
We can just do it!

863
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:51,099
Family register.

864
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:53,019
I like you Mr. Bong!

865
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:53,923
What?!

866
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:55,523
It was love at first sight!

867
01:04:55,523 --> 01:04:58,019
But Mr. Bong says he likes someone.

868
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,079
Is it true?

869
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:02,049
You must love it. The old lady gets a scandal and everything.

870
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:05,323
By chance are you jealous? You're jealous right?!

871
01:05:05,323 --> 01:05:07,523
- I said I'm not!- Whatever it totally is!

872
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:10,157
Ever since that day Chris isn't around much.

873
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,523
What the hell Bong Joon Gu? Why are you here?!

874
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:14,523
Are you crazy?!

875
01:05:14,523 --> 01:05:16,009
I applied to change majors!

876
01:05:16,009 --> 01:05:19,023
If I pass this time then go on a date with me on Christmas.

877
01:05:19,023 --> 01:05:20,059
Hey what are you doing?

878
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:25,057
- Come here.- Hyung!

879
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:28,523
Yeah! Yeah, Eun Jo!

880
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:31,823
Man, I'm going crazy because I want to go on a date with Oh Ha Ni!

881
01:05:31,823 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm late!

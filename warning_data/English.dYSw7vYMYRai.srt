1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,830
Solve for c and
graph the solution.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,460
We have negative 5c is
less than or equal to 15.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,510
So negative 5c is less
than or equal to 15.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,510
I just rewrote it a
little bit bigger.

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,049
So if we want to
solve for c, we just

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,430
want to isolate the c
right over here, maybe

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,190
on the left-hand side.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,480
It's right now being
multiplied by negative 5.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,780
So the best way to just have
a c on the left-hand side

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,730
is we can multiply both
sides of this inequality

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,070
by the inverse of negative
5, or by negative 1/5.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,630
So we want to multiply
negative 1/5 times negative 5c.

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,470
And we also want to multiply
15 times negative 1/5.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,650
I'm just multiplying both
sides of the inequality

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,430
by the inverse of negative 5,
because this will cancel out

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,500
with the negative 5 and
leave me just with c.

17
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,495
Now I didn't draw
the inequality here,

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,520
because we have to remember,
if we multiply or divide

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,570
both sides of an inequality
by a negative number,

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,370
you have to flip the inequality.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,490
And we are doing that.

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,620
We are multiplying both
sides by negative 1/5, which

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,400
is the equivalent of dividing
both sides by negative 5.

24
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,862
So we need to turn
this from a less

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,550
than or equal to a
greater than or equal.

26
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,390
And now we can
proceed solving for c.

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,580
So negative 1/5 times
negative 5 is 1.

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,060
So the left-hand
side is just going

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,320
to be c is greater than or
equal to 15 times negative 1/5.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,490
That's the same thing as
15 divided by negative 5.

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,740
And so that is negative 3.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,660
So our solution is c is greater
than or equal to negative 3.

33
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,970
And let's graph it.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,940
So that is my number line.

35
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,110
Let's say that is 0, negative
1, negative 2, negative 3.

36
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,570
And then I could go above, 1, 2.

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,950
And so c is greater than
or equal to negative 3.

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,820
So it can be equal
to negative 3.

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,630
So I'll fill that
in right over there.

40
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,050
Let me do it in a
different color.

41
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:58,606
So I'll fill it in
right over there.

42
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,630
And then it's
greater than as well.

43
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,710
So it's all of these values
I am filling in in green.

44
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,880
And you can verify that it works
in the original inequality.

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,530
Pick something that should work.

46
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,880
Well, 0 should work.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,920
0 is one of the numbers
that we filled in.

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,410
Negative 5 times 0 is 0, which
is less than or equal to 15.

49
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,860
It's less than 15.

50
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,687
Now let's try a number
that's outside of it.

51
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,070
And I haven't drawn it here.

52
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,397
I could continue with the
number line in this direction.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
We would have a negative 4 here.

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,660
Negative 4 should
not be included.

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,180
And let's verify that
negative 4 doesn't work.

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,950
Negative 4 times negative
5 is positive 20.

57
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,180
And positive 20 is
not less than 15,

58
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,760
so it's good that we did
not include negative 4.

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
So this is our solution.

60
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,960
And this is that
solution graphed.

61
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:51,037
And I wanted to do that
in that other green color.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Here you go.

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,880
That's what it looks like.

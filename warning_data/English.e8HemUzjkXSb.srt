1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's no fear in my heart

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Got nothing left to lose

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I saw my loved ones die

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, I swear that I won't give in

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
By God you'll never win

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll fight for what's right

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And nothing can stand in my way

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Even if I get knocked down

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will stand my ground

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I'll never

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hide or run away

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Love will prevail

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
By God it will

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Love will prevail

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I refuse to fail

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Love will prevail

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Life’s become so cheap

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So many orphans weep

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They forgot how to smile

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, I cannot understand

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just how somebody can

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Murder an innocent child

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I swear their lives won’t be lost in vain

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Even if I get knocked down

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will stand my ground

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And I'll never

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hide or run away

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Love will prevail

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
By God it will

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Love will prevail

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I refuse to fail

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Love will prevail

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
God made me free

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can’t take that away from me

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Freedom is my destiny

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have a dream

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And my dream is to see

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
To see all my people smile

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
See all of them free and proud

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I feel the wind of peace

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
‘Cause with hardship comes ease

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That’s why I won't lose faith

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I know that God is Great

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, I'll never

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hide or run away

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Love will prevail

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
By God it will

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Love will prevail

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I refuse to fail

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Love will prevail

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I won't run away

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Love will prevail

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
By God it will

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Love will prevail

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I refuse to fail

56
00:04:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Love will prevail

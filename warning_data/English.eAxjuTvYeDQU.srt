1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,830
In 926, the capital of Balhaefell to Georan.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,230
On the territory Georan founded

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,870
a new country called Dongranguk,which means 'Georan of East'.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,070
The survivals of Balhae,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,910
however, kept struggling fiercelyto restore their country.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:01:29,030
In 927, Autumn

7
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,150
A raid by the Killer-BladeArmy of Dongranguk!

8
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,470
Form a defense line!

9
00:01:35,470 --> 00:03:01,750
Don't give an inch, just fight back!

10
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:20,590
Gunhwapyeong!

11
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm honored.

12
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:31,670
The commander of the Killer-Blade Armyhas come to pay a personal visit.

13
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,030
I came all the way to ask you something.

14
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,550
Wouldn't you rather cooperatewith Dongranguk?

15
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,190
I'm a human being.

16
00:03:42,190 --> 00:04:02,150
You want me to be a dogfor Georan, like you?

17
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:50,350
Any last words?

18
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,150
I'm sad to announce

19
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,030
that even our future king, Prince Suhyeon,

20
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,870
has been assassinated by Gunhwapyeong.

21
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,230
Gunhwapyeong,

22
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,630
that traitor is killing off everyonefrom the royal family, cutting off the lineage.

23
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,030
Son of a Bitch!

24
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,710
I heard the news has spread all over,

25
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,670
hurting the morale of the people.

26
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,150
It's a big problem.

27
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,070
We need a king at a time like this.

28
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,790
With Prince Suhyeon dead,who can become our king?

29
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,710
Who else is left?

30
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,750
I've found a princewhose whereabouts were unknown.

31
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,830
Oh, is there a prince?Who is he?

32
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:44,510
Do you remember Prince Jeonghyeon?

33
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,150
What happened?

34
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,470
As you ordered, I sentMaeyoungok and Mabul to Jungwon.

35
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,510
Youngok...

36
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,510
She always works hard.

37
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,830
According to a secret agent,

38
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,510
Balhae has also dispatchedan excellent fighter...

39
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,070
Who's that?

40
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,550
We don't know yet.

41
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:21,430
Does anybody have any ideawho it could be?

42
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,310
This time you have to go far.

43
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,470
He's the son of LADY OH.

44
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,950
He was involved in some political strife14 years ago,

45
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,710
and sent to Jungwon.

46
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,150
He was exiled.

47
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,470
The Killer-Blade Army will be coming.

48
00:06:42,470 --> 00:07:06,830
We must find him before the they do.

49
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,190
We must have a king to unite our people.

50
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,070
If we can unite our people and soldiers,instead of fighting all over the place,

51
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:28,430
we can never lose...

52
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,390
Don't forget that.

53
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:59,070
Balhae's fate depends on him.

54
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,870
How was today?

55
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:14,110
What about the girl?

56
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,310
- Sosam?- Yes.

57
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,750
What have you got?

58
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,950
What do you need to sell?

59
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,910
I'll meet the gentleman firstand tell him.

60
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:33,750
Gentleman?

61
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:57,550
Sit over there and wait.

62
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,550
There's no need to doubt.

63
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,670
Just tell me how much you can pay.

64
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,030
There are others who are doingthis kind of business.

65
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,590
Why did you come to me?

66
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,790
I heard there's no later trouble with you.

67
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:22,150
No trouble when dealing with Sosam.

68
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,990
That's right.

69
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:33,990
The important thing is whether there will betrouble or not. The price is the next concern.

70
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,350
So, how much are you asking?

71
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,670
Fifty jeon...

72
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,750
You rat!That's too cheap!

73
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:55,710
Is about right,but I'll give you up to 80 jeon.

74
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:18,190
Fine.

75
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:41,590
Hey, Sosam, well...

76
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,870
I'm not sure where you heard of mebut you found the right person.

77
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,550
It's very importantwho you deal with here.

78
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,270
You have to find a credible person...

79
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,550
I have a question to ask you.

80
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,750
What is your honorable name?

81
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,350
You were looking for Sosam.

82
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:15,430
I'm asking for your real name.

83
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:35,550
There are too many eyes here.Follow me.

84
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:58,670
What you have,only two of them were existed.

85
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,070
I thought I've been seeing strangers lately.

86
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,390
Your Highness,there must be a misunderstanding.

87
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:16,790
I'd never misunderstand assassins.

88
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,030
Do me a favor.

89
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,030
Hey, Sosam.

90
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:28,310
That's no favor...I thank you.

91
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:40,270
Don't worry and just go!

92
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,550
A misunderstanding?Aren't you going to follow him?

93
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,270
I don't think anythingI say will matter right now.

94
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,510
Please, you guys need to help me.

95
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:57,190
Before that, you must help us first.

96
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:04,550
We're desperate.

97
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't think so

98
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:14,550
All I have learned is how to kill.

99
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,870
No need to talk to you.

100
00:13:17,870 --> 00:14:12,510
Kill her.

101
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:19,350
I said "I don't think so".

102
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,350
Okay, okay! Understood.

103
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,310
I would like to know something.

104
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,630
There is so called"Rules" on the back street.

105
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,350
I know 10 ways to make you speak.

106
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,030
But, I'm not sure you can bear it.

107
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:49,070
Calm down.I'm willing to give out everything.

108
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:59,190
Please sit down.

109
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,910
I'm Yeon Soha,officer first class of Biseonwon.

110
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,390
Please forgive my discourtesy,Your Highness.

111
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,390
Of course,I have to forgive in this situation.

112
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,270
I don't know why you think so,but I'm not an assassin.

113
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,790
Do you think I'm stupid?

114
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,670
They'll leave an exiled prince alive?

115
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,710
- What if other princes...- All the other princes are...

116
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,150
are no more.

117
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,670
Your Highness!You must become the king of Balhae.

118
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:41,270
I will be escorting you to Balhae.

119
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:49,070
I've lived in a place like this,hiding from assassins for 14 years.

120
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,710
And now that painful time is all gone

121
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:07,270
and I am to be the king of Balhae, right?

122
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,990
Do you think I believe that?

123
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,750
OK.

124
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,870
Let's say that's all true.Do you think I'm crazy?

125
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,590
That's only a title. You're saying thatI should become the king

126
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,990
to be chased by Georan,not knowing when I will be killed?

127
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,830
Do you know what I believe in?

128
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,230
"Survival, above all else."

129
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,950
That's all I'm interested in.

130
00:16:38,950 --> 00:17:30,630
Your Highness!

131
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,110
My kids came back almost all crippled,which means I lose face.

132
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,150
What are we supposed to do now, huh?

133
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,390
I didn't do it.

134
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:53,150
Did I say you did it, Prince?

135
00:17:53,150 --> 00:18:03,630
You ain't from battle field, are you?

136
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,310
Tell me.

137
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,870
About what?

138
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,950
Tell me the detailsso I can decide on the price.

139
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:20,590
How much money will you bring mewhen I hand you over?

140
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:34,870
Always the same routine...They need to be beaten to start speaking.

141
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,910
You... Stop!

142
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:47,990
She... She's the one!She attacked us!

143
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,990
Welcome.

144
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,310
I've heard interesting storiesabout your skills.

145
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,830
I'm the boss of...

146
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,430
I told you to take your hands off of him.

147
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:08,470
Not gonna work.You should talk to me.

148
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm the boss of...

149
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,110
Oh, Shit!

150
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,470
Your Highness, are you okay?

151
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,550
What's going on?They're on the same team!

152
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,230
Please don't worry.

153
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:37,670
I will protect you.

154
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:47,110
Bo... Boss...

155
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,270
Yeon Soha... It's you.

156
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,550
You came here.

157
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,230
We've passed a couple of times,

158
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,790
but this is the first timewe've said hello.

159
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,550
What do we do?There are more than two of them now.

160
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,990
Don't worry.

161
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,350
This is our region.And we've got more people.

162
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,270
Who are they now?

163
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,910
They're Dongranguk's Killer-Blade army.

164
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,510
Officer Yeon,

165
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,630
wouldn't it be better if we avoidedany unnecessary killings?

166
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,390
Give us Prince Jeonghyeon

167
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,950
and we'll guarantee your life.

168
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,230
I can never allow you to take him.

169
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:38,110
It's not going to work by talking.

170
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:47,790
Everyone stop!

171
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,350
What?

172
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,590
Looking at the current situation,I think you're the one we should join up with.

173
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,830
Get out!

174
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,190
Lt'll be better to talk.

175
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:15,950
I'm the boss of...

176
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:30,710
What are we doing?Kill them!

177
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,950
Your Highness, please run!

178
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,470
What?

179
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:44,030
We have to run away.Hurry!

180
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,630
What is the matter?

181
00:21:46,630 --> 00:23:36,550
Your Highness!

182
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:44,070
They'll keep coming.You have to keep away from them!

183
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:56,790
Follow me!

184
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,510
Tell me.

185
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,790
Who are you?

186
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,630
What do you have to dowith the Killer-Blade Army?

187
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,550
Most of them are traitors to Balhae.

188
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:17,710
In the past, I've seen themin the military.

189
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:23,110
Is that why you introducedyourself like that?

190
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:35,990
Is there something wrong withhow I introduced myself?

191
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,070
Then, how are you related tomy brother Suhyeon?

192
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,950
I've once guardedthe Crown Prince for a while.

193
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,830
We must go now.

194
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,510
Where to?This is the safest place.

195
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,830
There is no safe place.

196
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,710
As long as we are here,they'll eventually find you.

197
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,110
They will kill everyone on Wolnak streetif they need to...

198
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:09,830
That is the Killer-Blade army's way.

199
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,670
Didn't you say that surviving isyour only interest?

200
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,550
Then there's no other way.

201
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:30,510
Then follow me,I know a shortcut out of here.

202
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,990
You want a drink?

203
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,830
Is this the fast way you've mentioned?

204
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,510
We must eat well to go fast.

205
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:54,270
How can we travel far without eating?

206
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:00,110
They are the Bidomun, a branch ofHeukdobang's gang. I recognize the symbol.

207
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:15,830
I heard they are out of their mindsbecause their boss was killed.

208
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:21,790
Let's go now.We don't have much time.

209
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,990
I will decide whether to go or not.

210
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:36,750
If I don't like it, I won't go.

211
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,310
Who the hell are you?

212
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,590
My boss here told me

213
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,350
to ask you something!

214
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,830
What?That girl?

215
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,390
What did she say?

216
00:26:52,390 --> 00:27:00,190
She wonders if it's truethat your boss died

217
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,990
from overdoing it with women.

218
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:14,350
That bitch!

219
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,470
Please just ignore him and let it go.

220
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:42,870
Too late. We already heard him!

221
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,390
What are you doing?We are still in mourning for my father.

222
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,950
That guy picked a fight with us.We didn't have a choice.

223
00:27:50,950 --> 00:28:11,670
I gave you an order to be cautious,no matter what happened!

224
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:45,750
Say again what you just said.

225
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:59,030
I found him! Here! Here!

226
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,110
It's very late.Let's go now.

227
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:14,630
Uh... OK... Go quickly.

228
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,510
I appreciate your help very much.

229
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,550
Don't say that.How can I just ignore this kind of thing?

230
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,550
I wish...

231
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,390
I wish I could cut him though

232
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:32,470
for your sake...

233
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:46,830
Everything will be okay, don't worry.

234
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:53,550
Let's go.

235
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,310
What happened?

236
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,990
After listening to our story,she said she would help us.

237
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,150
Story?

238
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,870
You told her everything?

239
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,350
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,150
You have no idea how fast rumorsspread in this town.

241
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,790
I said that you abandoned your wifeand children to run away with a widow,

242
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,150
stealing your ill mother's money.

243
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:22,990
Hey! You're a warrior.How can you lie to people like that?

244
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:53,430
Sword is not the only thingyou need in the battle field.

245
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,910
Put these on. It's going to bea tough walk and quite cold from now on.

246
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,030
That's okay.

247
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:10,230
I'm not going to careif you get cold later on.

248
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:17,230
Let's go.

249
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:23,030
How did you learn martial art?

250
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,550
I've only trained to use sword.

251
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,630
Where did you learn to use it?

252
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,830
I learned from a military camp.

253
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:43,510
I had learned from many soldierssince I was little.

254
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,630
You had one rough life.

255
00:31:46,630 --> 00:32:06,230
I would've give up.

256
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,590
What is going on?

257
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,870
I need to get horses.

258
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,030
I don't think it is possible.

259
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,910
It is not like stealing clothes.

260
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:27,590
It is way too difficult to steal them.

261
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,190
We have to wait till dawn, and...

262
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:37,350
Don't worry, I can pay.

263
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,990
Damn, it's hot!It's killing me...

264
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,910
Wow, who's this! Brother Sosam!

265
00:32:45,910 --> 00:33:02,150
- I brought you a customer.- Customer?

266
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,670
Do you like any of them?

267
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,870
I want to buy the one on the far rightand the fourth one.

268
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:18,550
You know your horses.But they are quite expensive...

269
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,910
Since you came with Brother Sosam,

270
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,230
I'll give you a good deal.

271
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:39,270
For the two, give me 300 jeon.

272
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,630
I live off of you, Brother.

273
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,310
But they're real good horses!

274
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:52,190
- But they're stolen.- Shhh! Come on...

275
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:59,190
She's fine. Who is she?

276
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,750
A devil from hell.Come to take me to die.

277
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,270
What? Never understand a single word...

278
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,470
Anyway let me take a sword.I'd better carry one

279
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:16,790
since someone's trying to kill me...Let's see.

280
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,830
This one should be good.

281
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,990
Why did you choose that one?

282
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,470
Take a better one.I'll pick one for you.

283
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,630
Doesn't matter.I'll never use it anyhow.

284
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:40,030
You surprised me...

285
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,270
You're here again.

286
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,070
No word from the Deputy Commander yet?

287
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,110
Please don't worry...

288
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,510
Maeyoungok has never lost her quarry.

289
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,270
Wouldn't it depend on who the quarry is?

290
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,710
- Have you found out?- Of course!

291
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:07,070
Do you know a female warriorcalled Yeon Soha?

292
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,310
I'll go myself.

293
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,870
Are you going to kill the princeagain this time?

294
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,630
The royal court wantsBalhae's royal family to cooperate.

295
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,310
To help calm the conflicts and uprisingsall around the country.

296
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,190
But because you've been killingevery member of the royal family,

297
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,750
the court can't trust you.

298
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,590
If you want to gain something big,you'd better control your vengeful spirit.

299
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:56,470
Understand?

300
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:11,590
Father!

301
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,710
Welcome!

302
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,790
How can I help you?

303
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,950
We don't need dinner.Give us a place to stay.

304
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,790
Yes!

305
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:24,230
How many rooms...

306
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,950
Can't you see?There are two people.

307
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,510
Then I'll prepare...

308
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,630
Give us one room.

309
00:36:33,630 --> 00:37:00,990
One's enough.

310
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,950
Are you going to staylike that all night?

311
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,670
This is the way Biseonwon warriors

312
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,870
guard the door of the kinguntil he falls asleep.

313
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,950
Please do not worry.

314
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,550
If you're going to be silly,you'd better come in and be silly.

315
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,430
You're going to be the king.

316
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,310
There shouldn't beany kind of scandalous rumors.

317
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,350
Are we in Balhae?Who's going to see?

318
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,310
Whoever's watching or notis not important.

319
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,830
Under the heavens,The king should have nothing to hide.

320
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,630
You speak as if I'm going to be the king.

321
00:37:34,630 --> 00:38:51,510
When did I say I would?I'm not going to.

322
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:57,590
He said they went to Hadong.

323
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:09,470
The Chief Commander is coming.

324
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,350
Hey, Officer Yeon Soha!

325
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,110
You said you grew up in the military.

326
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,070
Was your father a soldier?

327
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,030
No, Sir.

328
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,510
Then, why?

329
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,550
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

330
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,630
Georan soldiers killed my fatherwhen I was 9,

331
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,830
my mother when I was 10...

332
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:44,350
I didn't have any other relatives.

333
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:47,670
It'll be tough to get to Hadong today.

334
00:39:47,670 --> 00:40:08,270
There's a place to stay near there.A very cozy place.

335
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,710
What's that?

336
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,390
That incense...

337
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:21,950
It's my habit to comfort the dead.

338
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:27,590
Those who I used to know and the enemieswho have been killed by my sword.

339
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,830
You comfort even the soulsof your enemies?

340
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:38,150
With no hatred or resentment?

341
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,110
At least you won't be eatenby an evil spirit.

342
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,590
Why?

343
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,350
I also learned how to usethe sword in Balhae.

344
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,270
I know the story

345
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:54,790
that evil spirits born from the resentment,spite, and hatred,

346
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:04,150
that lives on in your sword.

347
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,390
Grown-ups used to scare mewith the story

348
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,670
that an evil spirit growsby drinking blood

349
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,510
and finally makes the owner ofthe sword evil as well.

350
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,470
I learned when I grew up

351
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:25,990
that the story meant one shouldn'tlose serenity because of hatred.

352
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:34,630
I believe evil spirits grow in the sword.

353
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:40,670
Do you still believe what you were toldwhen you were little?

354
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,190
That is why you treat it so carefully.

355
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,910
It protects you from evil spirits.

356
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,350
Yes.

357
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,310
I believe I have to use the sword

358
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,030
to protect my important things.

359
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:59,790
Hey...

360
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:04,630
What would people thinkwhen they hold the sword?

361
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:11,550
Protecting? No way...

362
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,470
Killing comes the first.

363
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:20,830
That is instinct.

364
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:27,310
I have tried to tell a couple of times,

365
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,230
don't give me that look.

366
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,270
Don't give me that pity look.

367
00:42:33,270 --> 00:43:18,870
I have had a fairly great lifeuntil I met you.

368
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,590
I need to meet someone.Wait here for a while.

369
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,790
We don't have much time.There's still a long way to go...

370
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,470
It's the owner of this shop.

371
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,950
Don't go anywhere, just wait here.

372
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:39,670
It'll only take me a moment.

373
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:50,190
Hey, who's this?

374
00:43:50,190 --> 00:44:13,470
Here you go!

375
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,110
What are you doing here,without telling us you were coming?

376
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,070
I'd like to get back my moneythat you're keeping for me.

377
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,870
It looks like I'll have to goin hiding for a while.

378
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,590
What have you done?

379
00:44:27,590 --> 00:45:05,470
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

380
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,870
So where are you going this time?

381
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:12,630
Well...For now, quite far...

382
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:19,790
Sosam, to be honest, some peoplecame by here yesterday.

383
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,590
Who?

384
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:32,790
They... Said they werewith the Killer-Blade Army.

385
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:49,590
And they're looking for you!

386
00:45:49,590 --> 00:46:14,910
Let's talk.

387
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:23,310
Did you think you couldget away from me?

388
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,590
Let me ask you one thing.

389
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,030
Would you like to cooperatewith Dongranguk?

390
00:46:30,030 --> 00:55:20,150
Negotiate?I don't know what you mean by that...

391
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,190
You...

392
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,390
Why are you trying so hard

393
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:32,150
to take me?

394
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:45,310
Because you're going to beBalhae's king.

395
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,870
You've seen how I live.

396
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,310
Do you think the throne fits me?

397
00:55:52,310 --> 00:56:01,430
You'll be an excellent king.

398
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:09,190
Thank you for thinking highly of me,but let me tell you one thing.

399
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,110
I was going to leave you hereand run away.

400
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,430
I failed because my friend betrayed me.

401
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:22,150
If you were really going to do that,there were a lot of chances.

402
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,510
Why do you think I'm telling you this?

403
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,630
I have no intention to go to Balhae.

404
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,910
If I hope to survive,there are many other ways.

405
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,710
You have to go no matter what.

406
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:39,070
Then tell me one good reasonwhy I must go to Balhae.

407
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:43,110
Why do I have to go there?

408
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:49,790
As far as I know, you weren't presentat your mother's deathbed.

409
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:55,230
We'll pass by Cheonaegokon the way.

410
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:08,910
There is a graveyard.

411
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:23,550
Your Highness!

412
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:55,630
Long time no see.

413
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,910
I know only one thing.

414
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:02,870
My father and family were dishonored

415
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,550
and brutally killed bythe royal family of Balhae.

416
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,630
The charges against themwere not false.

417
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,030
I don't care who says what.

418
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:24,470
I will kill whoever insultedmy father and family.

419
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,550
Your Highness, are you OK?

420
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,910
No, I'm not OK.

421
00:58:29,910 --> 00:59:07,470
Do you know how terribleit is to be stabbed from behind?

422
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:13,270
A message came from headquarters.What would you like to do?

423
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:21,070
Say we haven't found them.

424
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:27,070
I'm not going backbefore I kill Yeon Soha.

425
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,030
Kill Yeon Soha?

426
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:35,790
As long as I'm under orders,I want to take care of it on my own.

427
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,790
And...

428
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:45,270
I don't want to cause trouble to you,most of all.

429
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:48,550
I will give you four days.

430
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:52,830
If I see Yeon Soha,

431
00:59:52,830 --> 01:00:03,590
you'll have no more chances.

432
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:07,550
It was quite close.

433
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:21,390
I guess it may not be that serious...

434
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:27,710
It is from the street fight.

435
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,670
It is from the battle field.

436
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,910
What made you think...

437
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:40,030
I wouldn't even get close to it.

438
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:44,190
I was told you joined the majesty,your father,

439
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:57,870
for the battle against Georanwhen you were only fifteen.

440
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:58,950
Georan soldiers!

441
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,670
They seem droppingout of the headquarters.

442
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:58,350
Your highness!

443
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:03,870
Look at this chaos.

444
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,430
They wouldn't have time to pack.

445
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:10,830
They wouldn't even dare to fight, but run.

446
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,950
What is that for?

447
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:18,110
It is for you since you are not well.

448
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,350
It seems so convenience.

449
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,990
Hand it over.

450
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:38,150
I will do, your highness.

451
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:40,550
Why?

452
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,950
Have you ever done carpenter's work?

453
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:48,550
I had to fix stuffs to sell.

454
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:53,870
Some dorks broke thingswhen they stole goods.

455
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:58,790
What? This is what I have been doing.

456
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:04,430
You see!I'm not even close to be a King.

457
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:10,510
You made wrong decision.

458
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,390
General KeumHwee.

459
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,310
For the fifteen years old prince

460
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:23,310
who was brave and fought in the battle field,every soldiers called you by that name.

461
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,110
With glint helmet,

462
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:32,110
You were surely stand out in the battle field.

463
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,870
How well do you know about me?

464
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,150
There were many princeswho fought in the field

465
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:41,870
but no one could even get close towhat you had done.

466
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:45,910
You are the one people rely onin this harsh time.

467
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,950
I'm nobody.

468
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,950
All that is left is useless myself, Sosam.

469
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,870
Your real nature wouldn't have changed.

470
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,590
That is wrong.

471
01:03:56,590 --> 01:04:01,230
I have confidence in you.

472
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:08,590
Don't be silly.What if you are wrong?

473
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:40,550
I bet my life on that.

474
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:42,230
Do we have to do that?

475
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:47,230
Going across the borderis the fastest way to Balhae.

476
01:04:47,230 --> 01:05:19,870
We could get into big troubleunless we put on Georan costumes.

477
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,870
Don't reveal your emotions.

478
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:43,950
They are looking forBalhae's militia corp soldiers.

479
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:49,030
Those who fought here were notfrom regular army of Balhae.

480
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:51,950
They were from militia corp.

481
01:05:51,950 --> 01:07:40,910
They used to be normal farmersor wood gatherers.

482
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:47,230
Give me the reins now.I'll take it from here.

483
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,150
That's okay.

484
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:54,110
I'm bored. I'm bored to death.

485
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,990
Take a nap.

486
01:07:56,990 --> 01:12:43,470
Or sing a song.

487
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:45,710
What is wrong with you?

488
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:49,910
You seem so upset.

489
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:56,230
With all your help, I try to help you back,

490
01:12:56,230 --> 01:13:06,230
but all I get is your angry look.

491
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:09,070
What is wrong with me, you asked?

492
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:12,430
Your highness, you were almost killed.

493
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,910
You should be a king.

494
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:18,950
Your life does not onlybelong to you, but to all people.

495
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:25,310
What you have donewould have kill more people.

496
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:29,030
You shouldn't worry too much.

497
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:40,070
Reason why I'm heading that way isto visit my mother's graveyard.

498
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,270
We are almost there.

499
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:52,550
There should be a personfrom Balhae waiting for us.

500
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:58,390
What's wrong?You don't look well.

501
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:02,230
I'm okay.

502
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:05,790
Let's rest for a moment.

503
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,950
We must go.

504
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:33,430
We can't slow down because of me.

505
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:39,630
Take it.

506
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:52,030
I may not be able to protect you,but I can avoid causing you more trouble.

507
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,830
Let's go, please.

508
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:02,950
You said the life of a king is not his own,

509
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,070
and said that he should run away,

510
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:09,310
even if the manwho would protect him is dying.

511
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:16,430
Let's say I'm the king of Balhae.

512
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:21,710
You're telling me I should become a king

513
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:26,430
who only thinks about himself,although his man is dying?

514
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:29,310
Is that a king?

515
01:15:29,310 --> 01:16:28,630
If that is...I will never become the king.

516
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:42,830
Please let me go.You have to receive a bow in welcome.

517
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:57,630
I, Jocheonsu, under General lmsunji,greet Prince Jeonghyeon, Your Highness.

518
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:00,750
What happened to you?

519
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:04,870
- Uncle...- Yes.

520
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:11,030
Please take care of the prince.

521
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:22,270
Soha!

522
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:26,390
Why is she sick? Is it serious?

523
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:34,430
Tell me what's happened.

524
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,670
She's been poisoned by snake venom.

525
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:45,790
I think it's too late.

526
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:49,070
I heard that lmseonju movedto protect the prince.

527
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:54,390
With his army...Do you understand what this means?

528
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:57,830
Once they arrive here,there'll be no chance!

529
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,030
I'll finish before they arrive.

530
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:05,150
The royal court wantssomething more specific.

531
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:08,510
They sent the Golden Boy Army here!

532
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:12,550
The Golden Bow Armywill catch the prince.

533
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:17,110
The Killer-Blade Army can waitfor a new mission.

534
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,150
But...

535
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:28,150
It's the orders of the court!Are you going to go against them?

536
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:33,030
I called you because of Gunhwapyeong.

537
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:38,870
The Killer-Blade Armyshould have taken care of this job.

538
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:43,590
But the Golden Bow Armyhas been sent already...

539
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:48,630
If the Golden Bow Armytakes the honor of victory,

540
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,710
I cannot keep my promisewith Gunhwapyeong.

541
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:55,590
Send us please.We are sure to succeed!

542
01:18:55,590 --> 01:19:02,670
I wish I could.But I already have my orders.

543
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:15,670
Well, there may be a way...

544
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,710
Can you give me your life for it?

545
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:35,910
Of course!

546
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:38,190
Do you know what I mean?

547
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:50,470
I... I am a warrior!

548
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:58,150
If there is any way for you to succeed,you must take it,

549
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:17,510
don't you think?

550
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:23,590
Don't you regret?About changing your country...

551
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:27,030
Why... don't you like it?

552
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,590
I don't care about country.

553
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:33,830
My only concern is to serve you.

554
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:41,830
Whatever your position is,

555
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:46,430
you're always the same person to me.

556
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,150
It won't take long...

557
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:54,270
Once the last prince is killedthe dream will come true...

558
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:58,390
I will establish my own country

559
01:20:58,390 --> 01:22:22,110
on the territory of current Balhaewith a help of Georan.

560
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:24,310
Now she passed the crucial moment.

561
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:33,710
She will wake up soon.

562
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:46,270
Now you should gomeet your mother.

563
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:50,870
Yayul cheolla said we have to leave

564
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:58,190
before the Golden Bow Army arrives.

565
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:09,150
I will never forgetwhat you wished for, Maeyoungok...

566
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,390
Have you contactedthe Golden Bow Army?

567
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:14,150
Of course.

568
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:19,950
They might attack you Killer Bladesunless they know you're coming.

569
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:24,150
Prince Jeonghyeon will be dead...

570
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:31,190
No matter who finds him,the Killer Blades or the Golden Bows.

571
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:34,830
What do you mean?You're still thinking like that?

572
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:45,310
The court wants the prince alive...

573
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:50,430
You... think you'll be okay after this?

574
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:54,350
The Balhae people killed you.

575
01:23:54,350 --> 01:24:00,510
Or, better yet, Prince Jeonghyeon.

576
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:07,710
So I killed Jeonghyeon to avenge you.

577
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,670
It's a simple story.

578
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:30,550
You... Ingrate...

579
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:33,830
He is dead.

580
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:52,270
Send this message of his deathto the Gloden Bow Army.

581
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:57,310
I think you should go.She may be awake.

582
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:01,550
I should.

583
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:04,030
Your name is Jocheonsu, right?

584
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:10,470
Yes, your highness.

585
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,470
You look familiar.

586
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:16,750
I have seen you a couple of timesin the battle field,

587
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:21,030
General Keumhwee.

588
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:31,630
How is the wound on your back?

589
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:43,230
Your Highness.There is a person from headquarters.

590
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:57,270
Chief of assault team, Jochensu.I came here to see you, your highness.

591
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,630
You are deeply wounded.

592
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:02,270
I will call medic to bring youto headquarters.

593
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:08,070
It wouldn't take long, your highness.

594
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:14,430
I remember you, now.Chief of assault team, Jochensu.

595
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:18,670
Please take your time to see her.

596
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:40,110
I will.

597
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:45,990
Soha!

598
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:49,430
You're awake. Good.

599
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:51,190
The prince is not here.

600
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:55,190
He went to Lady Oh's grave.

601
01:26:55,190 --> 01:27:10,110
He was on guard for you all night.

602
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:12,270
Gunhwapyeong's here!

603
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:18,110
Is that how Gunhwapyeong indicateshe's on the hunt?

604
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:21,990
The prince is in danger!

605
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:29,910
Mother, I'm here.

606
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:40,030
I survived no matter whatas I promised to you.

607
01:27:40,030 --> 01:28:04,030
Are you satisfied now?

608
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:09,230
Aren't you... Jocheonsu, the onewho used to be called the One-Strike-Killer?

609
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:12,110
It's been a long time, Gunhwapyeong.

610
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:19,510
I've heard enoughabout your brutal killings.

611
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:24,350
Take off.I'll catch you up later.

612
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:29,790
Hurry!

613
01:28:29,790 --> 01:29:06,790
Now that you've met me,I think you're killing days are over.

614
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:09,070
We must hurry.

615
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,510
Have you recovered? Are you ok?

616
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:34,390
Yes, I'm fine. Let's go.

617
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:36,990
Better than expected, Gunhwapyeong.

618
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:51,070
But you're just an old tiger now...

619
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:53,030
This... This is...

620
01:29:53,030 --> 01:30:26,230
To the victor goes the spoils...

621
01:30:26,230 --> 01:31:03,510
Your Highness!

622
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:08,790
No more energy, already?

623
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:11,990
I know what's happening to you.

624
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:15,670
If you overuse your energywhen you're poisoned,

625
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:20,310
your blood gets all twisted.

626
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:23,110
If you practice your military techniques,

627
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,710
you'll die.

628
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:28,670
You're wrong.

629
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,350
There's difference betweennot being able to use the techniques

630
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:34,910
and not being allowed to use them.

631
01:31:34,910 --> 01:32:09,710
You... What's going on?

632
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:11,430
Stop right there,Commander Gunhwapyeong.

633
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:15,430
Jocheonsu is dead. I killed him...

634
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:17,750
And now

635
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:25,430
I'm going to kill that prince...

636
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,430
There's only one way.

637
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:29,750
There's one attack,but it will cost you your life.

638
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:33,430
Do you know what you need forthat one blow?

639
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:37,630
You need the will to kill.

640
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:42,390
Think of how much you want to kill.That's all.

641
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:48,110
The sword... it's not for killing.

642
01:32:48,110 --> 01:34:46,470
It is for protecting valuable things.

643
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:51,150
But nobody can block my way...

644
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:59,310
Just sit there...

645
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:11,190
and watch the prince die helplessly.

646
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:14,630
That... sword...

647
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:16,830
You know it well...

648
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:20,630
Your father gave the same swordto two young princes.

649
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:22,310
How... How did you...

650
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:31,830
Because I killed Daesuhyeon.

651
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:35,950
Your Highness.Teach me how to use the sword.

652
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:39,270
Why do you want to learn?

653
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:44,990
My father and mother,both were killed by the Georan people.

654
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:48,190
I... I want to learn.

655
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:53,550
The sword is not for killingor hurting people.

656
01:35:53,550 --> 01:36:17,870
Rather, it's for protecting something valuable.

657
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:23,470
Let me ask you one thing.Why do you have it?

658
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:28,070
I saved it to kill you...

659
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:31,350
the last in the lineage.

660
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:34,310
That's wrong...

661
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:39,990
That sword is not the secret swordyou think it is.

662
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:43,750
But the sword you were lookin for is...

663
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:48,110
The true sword isthe valuable spirit of Soha's.

664
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:54,070
I must save that spirit.

665
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:58,910
No matter what.

666
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:02,110
There's this thing calledthe Body-Attack technique.

667
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:09,390
Both Daesuhyeon and Jocheonsu...I killed them with this skill.

668
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:16,710
With this skill...I will also kill you. Slowly.

669
01:37:16,710 --> 01:38:55,630
With the secret skill ofthe Balhae royal family.

670
01:38:55,630 --> 01:39:01,190
You know,this was the only military technique

671
01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:05,390
that I learned completely.

672
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:20,070
I guess you haven't learnedhow to overcome the inner shock.

673
01:39:20,070 --> 01:40:06,710
From the beginning,you couldn't beat me.

674
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:09,710
Why...

675
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:15,190
Why didn't you tell me?

676
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:27,910
You must pass Cheonaegok now.

677
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:35,750
I'm asking you why...

678
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:37,390
You...

679
01:40:37,390 --> 01:40:42,470
You really thought I'd be the king?

680
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:46,550
Since the day I met you in Junwon,

681
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:50,230
I've never doubted. Not even once...

682
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:53,910
Because you must be...

683
01:40:53,910 --> 01:41:00,030
the same person you were 14 years ago.

684
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:03,830
Without you...

685
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:11,910
I wouldn't be here.

686
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:17,390
You brought me a reason to live...

687
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:22,230
to me who lost everything.

688
01:41:22,230 --> 01:42:24,550
You were my life for 14 years.

689
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:30,270
It's General lmsunjiand soldier of Balhae.

690
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:36,870
Please get ready to meet them.

691
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:38,710
Soha!

692
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:41,430
Soha!

693
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:47,110
I... I have no chance.

694
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:51,070
What are you talking about?Everything is over!

695
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:52,550
We're almost there!

696
01:42:52,550 --> 01:43:01,110
Please don't say anything.Please stay like this for a while.

697
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:16,070
I beg you...

698
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:25,830
Your Highness, I kept my promise.

699
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:34,830
But... You didn't...Save your life.

700
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:50,710
I saved somethingmore valuable than my life.

701
01:43:50,710 --> 01:44:03,750
Sword is to protectimportant things to you.

702
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:28,950
Am I right?

703
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:31,830
Soha...

704
01:44:31,830 --> 01:46:13,030
Soha!

705
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:23,030
We were robbed our castles, our land

706
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:26,830
and our country.

707
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:39,310
They even stole our capitaland changed the name of the palace.

708
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:42,230
A lot of people have died.

709
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:45,630
They're telling us

710
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:52,430
to recover the valuable thingsthe things they lost.

711
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:56,710
So, in this battle,

712
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:01,830
we are not going to falter or fail in!We'll continue to fight.

713
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:05,110
If our swords break,we'll fight with our hands.

714
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:09,110
If we have no strength and are caught,our eyes will pierce the enemies.

715
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:11,110
If our eyes get plucked out...

716
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:17,070
We'll speak about their sinsto the heavens!

717
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:19,670
We'll let them know

718
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:29,710
they can never take us from this land!

719
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:37,070
Now this castle will againbe called Holhan Palace

720
01:47:37,070 --> 01:48:05,670
and we'll restore our country!

721
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:19,590
Charge!

722
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:23,430
In 928, Dongrangukwithdrew to Leaotong area.

723
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,950
Post-Balhae and Jeongahngukwere founded on the territory.

724
01:48:26,950 --> 01:49:45,350
Both of them proudly called themselvesthe descendants of Balhae.

725
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:48,350
The medics have arrived to escort you.

726
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:51,230
- Genera Jo.- Please speak freely.

727
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:57,790
This kid lost both parents.

728
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:03,950
Please take care of her.

729
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:13,510
Yes, sir.

730
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:18,110
You remember everything I told you?

731
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:19,230
Yes.

732
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:24,670
Can you promise you won't forget?

733
01:50:24,670 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes, I promise.

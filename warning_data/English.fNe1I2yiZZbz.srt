1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,345
Many people take their lives every day because of this taboo.

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:04,671
The Bible is a very dangerous text.

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:12,500
In the FPÃ– [Austrian populist party] they said that homosexuality is a culture of death.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,171
If it's not possible to sacrifice just a little bit of tradition in order to give teenagers the feeling that

5
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:24,443
they live in a less threatening environment and they can therefore avoid taking their own lives,

6
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:42,750
then you can not really talk about loving your neighbour.

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,614
The Bible is a very dangerous text. There are several passages which incite homophobic hatred.

8
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:59,213
There is one, for example, that says that if two men sleep with each other, both of them must be killed.

9
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:06,972
It says exactly: "their blood shall be upon themselves". This is in Leviticus. It is of course also in the Torah.

10
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:14,312
In the Qu'ran it doesn't say that they should be killed, but that they should be punished.

11
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:26,042
There are crazy and fanatic people everywhere. The probability that someone opens those books and kills someone because of that

12
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:31,700
is there as a result and will be always there, as long as these texts continue to be blessed as God's word.

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:41,000
There are many priests who speak in favour of homosexual marriage.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:02:05,500
but each one reads what he wants and interprets what suits him.

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:17,046
I think homosexuality is illegal in 71 countries and in eight of these countries it is punishable by death.

16
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:22,515
Acceptance of homosexuality is as low as two percent in some countries.

17
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:31,479
In India there are temples where you can see figures having homosexual intercourse, and of course those also having heterosexual intercourse.

18
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:39,438
In Japan and in China it was also like that, you can appreciate it in the arts, and in literature.

19
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:55,472
In Peru and in Ecuador there are lesbian teenagers who are committed into clinics where they are raped because their parents don't know what else to do with them.

20
00:02:55,472 --> 00:03:11,239
The archbishop of Oaxaca, Mexico, said a short time ago that no clean and honest woman or man would like to be homosexual.

21
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,912
Some others spoke against our right to work as teachers.

22
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:26,305
Last year between 800 and 1000 rabbis; I don't know if only in the USA or worldwide;

23
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:33,700
said that homosexuals are to blame for the earthquake in Haiti.

24
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:46,243
Berlusconi said, for example, that it's better to treat women the way he does, that it's better to treat women the way he does

25
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:54,000
than to be gay, even though he sleeps with minors!

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,107
Not only right-wing politicians speak like that, but also for example, one left-wing politician,

27
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:10,035
Evo Morales from Bolivia said that the reason why there are so many homosexuals in Europe;

28
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,671
which is of course nonsense because in Bolivia there are just as many as there are here and

29
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:19,044
they just hide themselves more there because they cannot live as freely,

30
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:26,436
exactly because of people like him who instigate homophobic ideas like that,

31
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:42,890
He said that the reason that there are so many homosexuals in Europe is that our food here is genetically altered.

32
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:52,514
When homosexual marriage got legalized last year in Argentina, the archbishop of Buenos Aires

33
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:55,969
Said it's a war of God.

34
00:04:55,969 --> 00:05:23,000
Of course he found support in the Bible for that.

35
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,904
They say it's an anomaly and also something unnatural, but they don't know that homosexuality

36
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:38,046
is documented in detail in 500 species and it was registered in 1500.

37
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:45,171
We are not so different from the rest of the animals. Homosexuality is observed especially between intelligent species,

38
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:52,045
for example, between monkeys.

39
00:05:52,045 --> 00:06:05,542
There was no homophobic behaviour found among animals.

40
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:15,506
The problem is that at school they speak a lot about racism, about acceptance of minorities,

41
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:23,912
but they don't speak at all about homophobia. They always leave that out.

42
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:37,977
Most frequent swear words in every school playground, according to the union of teachers of Germany, are "gay" and "faggot".

43
00:06:37,977 --> 00:07:11,313
The teachers don't intervene and many of them even support that.

44
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:15,401
Excuse me! Couldn't you do that at home? It's disgusting!

45
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,639
"We'll play a joke. Are you ready?" and they say "yes, of course".

46
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:32,003
For most teenagers it's not so easy because it takes a time till you accept it, since it's so frowned upon in society.

47
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:41,312
Children don't have contact with other homosexuals or they don't know that they do,

48
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:48,537
and that's why the suicide rate among homosexual teenagers is much higher than among heterosexuals.

49
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:54,042
That's why it's very very dangerous to use the word "gay" in a negative sense.

50
00:07:54,042 --> 00:08:00,315
Also lesbian teens suffer a lot because of that.

51
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:07,707
The Church always speaks against the marriage and says that the sense of marriage is reproduction.

52
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:16,900
This doesn't make a lot of sense because also other people who aren't able to reproduce are allowed to marry.

53
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:25,040
50 year old women, for example, can also get married and no one considers it a scandal.

54
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:41,611
And it's also because of this tradition that homosexuals generally have very low self-confidence

55
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:46,682
and that's why they don't talk about their rights in public.

56
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:55,208
and unfortunately only the people who are really concerned are the ones who speak about it.

57
00:08:55,208 --> 00:09:06,270
This was the same in the case of black people in the USA. They were always black people who fought against racism.

58
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:15,313
In the case of homosexuals it's the same, but I don't completely agree with the way they speak out.

59
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:23,639
Only one time a year are there parades, in cities around the world, that for me are actually pointless

60
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,010
they only make many people confirm the prejudices they have.

61
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:36,903
I think many of them mean it ironically. They show exactly the characteristics society ascribes to us.

62
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:45,712
and you laugh about yourself. But most people don't understand it and think homosexuals

63
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:49,467
are only those crazy people who walk half-naked on the street.

64
00:09:49,467 --> 00:10:01,300
Many people don't know that we are exactly like others and that we don't always dress in such a strange and conspicuous way.

65
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:11,173
and that the life we lead is not so different from that most people lead. I wake up in the morning, have breakfast,

66
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:17,913
I brush my teeth, I have a shower, I go then to the University or to work, after that I go back home

67
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:24,471
and I don't lead an especially different life from most other people.

68
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:38,076
But people don't understand it because most of them hide themselves because they don't dare to be open about it

69
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:49,146
And because of the influence of Saudi Arabia they criminalized it...

70
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:55,938
Hello! This is an interview. You can take part if you want.

71
00:10:55,938 --> 99:59:59,999
- Did you hear what he said? - What? - "Is this a karaoke show?"

1
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,630
500 years ago,

2
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:14,671
trans-oceanic travel became a reality.

3
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:19,916
Since the end of the last Ice Age,

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,597
farming societies have been absorbing their neighbors,

5
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:27,682
making populations more similar within continents.

6
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:34,534
That when people began to cross oceans, in large numbers,

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,699
the genetic and cultural differences

8
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,209
between people from different continents

9
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:43,433
also began to fade, though not disappear.

10
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:49,075
Many families relocated

11
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:50,805
Willingly,

12
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,033
or unwillingly

13
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,099
to very distant lands.

14
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:03,826
Sometimes, they found unoccupied lands,

15
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:09,764
and sometimes they found lands occupied,

16
00:01:09,764 --> 00:01:12,135
and wished they weren't.

17
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:17,440
And sometimes they found land and labor,

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,410
and devised ways of exploiting both.

19
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:25,930
All over the world,

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,380
people separated by thousands of kilometers

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,962
for thousands of years

22
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,157
began meeting once again

23
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:36,497
and producing children.

24
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:42,363
Today, whole regions, like the Americas,

25
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,143
are populated by people

26
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:48,151
who can trace their ancestry back to multiple continents.

27
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,725
But some small groups

28
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:56,093
are more geographically or culturally isolated,

29
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:59,233
and remain genetically distinguishable.

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,288
As long distance transportation gets easier and easier,

31
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:08,952
and individual societies become more diverse,

32
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,441
languages are being lost,

33
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:16,086
and genetic distinctions across the globe are fading.

34
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,568
But these genetic distinctions,

35
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:24,290
are a relatively recent phenomenon in our history.

36
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,791
We haven't been separated for very long.

00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,550
What expression can be used to
show dividing 18 boxes into

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,540
two equals stacks?

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,550
Find the expression three times
using different ways to

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,730
write division.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,665
Find the value of
the expression.

6
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:15,170
So let's just do this
top part right here.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,780
We have 18 boxes, and we want to
divide them into two equals

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,720
stacks, so we want to
divide 18 by 2.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,600
And the way we would write this,
and we'll think a little

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,780
bit more about what this
means, we could write

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,520
this as 18 over 2.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,360
This means 18 divided by 2.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:43,730
We could write it as 18 divided
by 2, just like that,

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:52,300
or we could write it
as 18 divided by 2.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,250
Now before we evaluate it, they
say find the value of the

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,010
expression.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,300
Let's think about
what this means.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,500
We have 18 boxes and we
want to divide them

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,810
into two equal stacks.

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,980
Let me draw 18 boxes.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:22,570
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12-- almost

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:30,340
there-- 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,110
So those are my 18 boxes, and I
divide them into two equals

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,840
stacks or two equal groups.

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,860
So if I want to divide these
into two different groups that

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,390
have the same number of boxes,
I could just eyeball it, and

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,230
say, well, let's make these
top ones one group.

28
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,490
Let's make that one of the
groups, and let's making these

29
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,480
bottom ones another group.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,720
And these are equal groups.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,710
How many do we have
in each group?

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,010
Well, in the top one, we have
one, two, three, four, five,

33
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,660
six, seven, eight, nine, and in
the bottom one we have one,

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,900
two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,470
So we've split it into
two groups of nine.

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,090
So 18 divided into two equal
groups is equal to 9, or 18

37
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,020
divided by 2 is equal to 9, or
2 goes into 18 nine times.

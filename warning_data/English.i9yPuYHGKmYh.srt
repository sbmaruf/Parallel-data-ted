warehouses, and bringing up the rear of

378
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:51,082
every funeral I meet; and especiallywhenever my hypos get such an upper hand of

379
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:56,054
me, that it requires a strong moralprinciple to prevent me from deliberately

380
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:58,098
stepping into the street, and methodically

381
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:05,008
knocking people's hats off--then, I accountit high time to get to sea as soon as I

00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:09,078
can.This is my substitute for pistol and ball.

397
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:20,689
Some leaning against the spiles; someseated upon the pier-heads; some looking

398
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:26,499
over the bulwarks of ships from China; somehigh aloft in the rigging, as if striving

399

to get a still better seaward peep.

400
00:31:29,026 --> 00:31:34,076

404

405
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,051
for a dive.

406
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:54,026
Strange!Nothing will content them but the extremest

407
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:59,199
limit of the land; loitering under theshady lee of yonder warehouses will not

408
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,043
suffice.

409
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:06,046
No. They must get just as nigh the water asthey possibly can without falling in.

410
00:32:06,046 --> 00:32:10,051
And there they stand--miles of them--leagues.

411
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:16,279
Inlanders all, they come from lanes andalleys, streets and avenues--north, east,

412
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:20,007
south, and west.Yet here they all unite.

413
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:25,051
Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of theneedles of the compasses of all those ships

414
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:28,073
attract them thither?Once more.

Say you are in the country; in some highland of lakes.

416

417
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:40,139
leaves you there by a pool in the stream.

418
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:41,279
There is magic in it.

419
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,329
Let the most absent-minded of men beplunged in his deepest reveries--stand that

420
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:52,729
man on his legs, set his feet a-going, andhe will infallibly lead you to water, if

421
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:55,076

422

424
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:11,096
Yes, as every one knows, meditation andwater are wedded for ever.

425
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:13,499
But here is an artist.

426
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:18,071
He desires to paint you the dreamiest,shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of

427
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:22,056
romantic landscape in all the valley of theSaco.

428
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:25,004
What is the chief element he employs?

429
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:30,008
There stand his trees, each with a hollowtrunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were

430
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:36,009
within; and here sleeps his meadow, andthere sleep his cattle; and up from yonder

431
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:39,048
cottage goes a sleepy smoke.

432
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:44,052
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazyway, reaching to overlapping spurs of

433
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:48,057
mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.

434
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:53,035
But though the picture lies thus tranced,and though this pine-tree shakes down its

435
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:58,055
sighs like leaves upon this shepherd'shead, yet all were vain, unless the

436

shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magicstream before him.

Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, wouldyou travel your thousand miles to see it?

441
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,034
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, uponsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,

442
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:34,077
deliberate whether to buy him a coat, whichhe sadly needed, or invest his money in a

443
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:37,071
pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?

444
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:43,057
Why is almost every robust healthy boy witha robust healthy soul in him, at some time

445
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:46,045
or other crazy to go to sea?

446
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:51,096
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger,did you yourself feel such a mystical

447
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:58,027
vibration, when first told that you andyour ship were now out of sight of land?

448
00:34:58,027 --> 00:35:00,099
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?

449
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:06,098
Why did the Greeks give it a separatedeity, and own brother of Jove?

450
00:35:06,098 --> 00:35:10,034
Surely all this is not without meaning.

451
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:14,071
And still deeper the meaning of that storyof Narcissus, who because he could not

452
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:20,023
grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw inthe fountain, plunged into it and was

453
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:21,088
drowned.

454
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:27,023
But that same image, we ourselves see inall rivers and oceans.

455
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:35,065
It is the image of the ungraspable phantomof life; and this is the key to it all.

456
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:39,091
Now, when I say that I am in the habit ofgoing to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy

457
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:44,097
about the eyes, and begin to be overconscious of my lungs, I do not mean to

458
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:48,079
have it inferred that I ever go to sea as apassenger.

459
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,069
For to go as a passenger you must needshave a purse, and a purse is but a rag

460
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,047
unless you have something in it.

461
00:35:56,047 --> 00:36:01,029
Besides, passengers get sea-sick--growquarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not

462
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:07,025
enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though

463
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:09,079
I am something of a salt, do I ever go to

464
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,064
sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or aCook.

465
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:18,079
I abandon the glory and distinction of suchoffices to those who like them.

466
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,086
For my part, I abominate all honourablerespectable toils, trials, and tribulations

467
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:27,064
of every kind whatsoever.

468
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:32,028
It is quite as much as I can do to takecare of myself, without taking care of

469
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:36,022
ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and whatnot.

470
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:42,001
And as for going as cook,--though I confessthere is considerable glory in that, a cook

471
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:48,086
being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet,somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--

472
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:51,023
though once broiled, judiciously buttered,

473
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:56,003
and judgmatically salted and peppered,there is no one who will speak more

474
00:36:56,003 --> 00:37:01,017
respectfully, not to say reverentially, ofa broiled fowl than I will.

475
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:07,011
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of theold Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted

476
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:12,064
river horse, that you see the mummies ofthose creatures in their huge bake-houses

477
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,034
the pyramids.

478
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:20,059
No, when I go to sea, I go as a simplesailor, right before the mast, plumb down

479
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:24,088
into the forecastle, aloft there to theroyal mast-head.

480
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:30,029
True, they rather order me about some, andmake me jump from spar to spar, like a

481
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:34,529
grasshopper in a May meadow.And at first, this sort of thing is

482
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,219
unpleasant enough.

483
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:40,349
It touches one's sense of honour,particularly if you come of an old

484
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:46,068
established family in the land, the VanRensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.

485
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:51,003
And more than all, if just previous toputting your hand into the tar-pot, you

486
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:56,012
have been lording it as a countryschoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand

487
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,081
in awe of you.

488
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:03,219
The transition is a keen one, I assure you,from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and

489
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:08,719
requires a strong decoction of Seneca andthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear

490
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,094
it.

491
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:15,011
But even this wears off in time.What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-

492
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:18,539
captain orders me to get a broom and sweepdown the decks?

493
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,979
What does that indignity amount to,weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New

494
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:24,329
Testament?

495
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:29,024
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinksanything the less of me, because I promptly

496
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:33,057
and respectfully obey that old hunks inthat particular instance?

497
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,001
Who ain't a slave?

498
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,409
Tell me that.

499
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:41,399
Well, then, however the old sea-captainsmay order me about--however they may thump

500
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:47,339
and punch me about, I have the satisfactionof knowing that it is all right; that

501
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,013
everybody else is one way or other served

502
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:56,479
in much the same way--either in a physicalor metaphysical point of view, that is; and

503
00:38:56,479 --> 00:39:01,094
so the universal thump is passed round, andall hands should rub each other's shoulder-

504
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:05,469
blades, and be content.

505
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:09,959
Again, I always go to sea as a sailor,because they make a point of paying me for

506
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:14,849
my trouble, whereas they never paypassengers a single penny that I ever heard

507
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:15,519
of.

508
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,409
On the contrary, passengers themselves mustpay.

509
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:24,061
And there is all the difference in theworld between paying and being paid.

510
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:29,019
The act of paying is perhaps the mostuncomfortable infliction that the two

511
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:35,329
orchard thieves entailed upon us.But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?

512
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:39,699
The urbane activity with which a manreceives money is really marvellous,

513
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:44,979
considering that we so earnestly believemoney to be the root of all earthly ills,

514
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:48,949
and that on no account can a monied manenter heaven.

515
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:54,409
Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves toperdition!

516
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:59,000
Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor,because of the wholesome exercise and pure

517
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,032
air of the fore-castle deck.

518
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:06,139
For as in this world, head winds are farmore prevalent than winds from astern (that

519
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:11,899
is, if you never violate the Pythagoreanmaxim), so for the most part the Commodore

520
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:14,339
on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at

521
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,349
second hand from the sailors on theforecastle.

522
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:20,699
He thinks he breathes it first; but not so.

523
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:25,659
In much the same way do the commonalty leadtheir leaders in many other things, at the

524
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,061
same time that the leaders little suspectit.

525
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:33,000
But wherefore it was that after havingrepeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant

526
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,649
sailor, I should now take it into my headto go on a whaling voyage; this the

527
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:40,339
invisible police officer of the Fates, who

528
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:46,018
has the constant surveillance of me, andsecretly dogs me, and influences me in some

529
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:51,259
unaccountable way--he can better answerthan any one else.

530
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:55,849
And, doubtless, my going on this whalingvoyage, formed part of the grand programme

531
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,319
of Providence that was drawn up a long timeago.

532
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:04,081
It came in as a sort of brief interlude andsolo between more extensive performances.

533
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:10,006
I take it that this part of the bill musthave run something like this:

534
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:14,259
"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THEPRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.

535
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:19,093
"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL."BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."

536
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:25,038
Though I cannot tell why it was exactlythat those stage managers, the Fates, put

537
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:30,039
me down for this shabby part of a whalingvoyage, when others were set down for

538
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,017
magnificent parts in high tragedies, and

539
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:39,529
short and easy parts in genteel comedies,and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot

540
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:45,659
tell why this was exactly; yet, now that Irecall all the circumstances, I think I can

541
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:48,018
see a little into the springs and motives

542
00:41:48,018 --> 00:41:53,086
which being cunningly presented to me undervarious disguises, induced me to set about

543
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:59,599
performing the part I did, besides cajolingme into the delusion that it was a choice

544
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,589
resulting from my own unbiased freewill anddiscriminating judgment.

545
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:09,349
Chief among these motives was theoverwhelming idea of the great whale

546
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:10,068
himself.

547
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:16,289
Such a portentous and mysterious monsterroused all my curiosity.

548
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:21,599
Then the wild and distant seas where herolled his island bulk; the undeliverable,

549
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,819
nameless perils of the whale; these, withall the attending marvels of a thousand

550
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:32,043
Patagonian sights and sounds, helped tosway me to my wish.

551
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:38,079
With other men, perhaps, such things wouldnot have been inducements; but as for me,

552
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,219
I am tormented with an everlasting itch forthings remote.

553
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:47,269
I love to sail forbidden seas, and land onbarbarous coasts.

554
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:52,409
Not ignoring what is good, I am quick toperceive a horror, and could still be

555
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:57,339
social with it--would they let me--since itis but well to be on friendly terms with

556
00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:01,339
all the inmates of the place one lodges in.

557
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:05,899
By reason of these things, then, thewhaling voyage was welcome; the great

558
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:11,459
flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open,and in the wild conceits that swayed me to

559
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:14,012
my purpose, two and two there floated into

560
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:21,024
my inmost soul, endless processions of thewhale, and, mid most of them all, one grand

561
00:43:21,024 --> 00:43:27,055
hooded phantom, like a snow hill in theair.

562
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:31,011
Chapter 2.The Carpet-Bag.

563
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:35,779
I stuffed a shirt or two into my oldcarpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and

564
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:41,056
started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I

565
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:44,039
duly arrived in New Bedford.

566
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,006
It was a Saturday night in December.

567
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:50,074
Much was I disappointed upon learning thatthe little packet for Nantucket had already

568
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:54,879
sailed, and that no way of reaching thatplace would offer, till the following

569
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:56,479
Monday.

570
00:43:56,479 --> 00:44:01,519
As most young candidates for the pains andpenalties of whaling stop at this same New

571
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,012
Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage,it may as well be related that I, for one,

572
00:44:06,012 --> 00:44:08,092
had no idea of so doing.

573
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:14,099
For my mind was made up to sail in no otherthan a Nantucket craft, because there was a

574
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:19,024
fine, boisterous something about everythingconnected with that famous old island,

575
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,909
which amazingly pleased me.

576
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:26,969
Besides though New Bedford has of late beengradually monopolising the business of

577
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:32,008
whaling, and though in this matter poor oldNantucket is now much behind her, yet

578
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:35,067
Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre

579
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:40,759
of this Carthage;--the place where thefirst dead American whale was stranded.

580
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:46,129
Where else but from Nantucket did thoseaboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first

581
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:49,037
sally out in canoes to give chase to theLeviathan?

582
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:54,939
And where but from Nantucket, too, did thatfirst adventurous little sloop put forth,

583
00:44:54,939 --> 00:45:01,219
partly laden with imported cobblestones--sogoes the story--to throw at the whales, in

584
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:07,039
order to discover when they were nighenough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?

585
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,087
Now having a night, a day, and stillanother night following before me in New

586
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:17,209
Bedford, ere I could embark for my destinedport, it became a matter of concernment

587
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:20,189
where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

588
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:26,018
It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a verydark and dismal night, bitingly cold and

589
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,049
cheerless.I knew no one in the place.

590
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:34,329
With anxious grapnels I had sounded mypocket, and only brought up a few pieces of

591
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:40,008
silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael, saidI to myself, as I stood in the middle of a

592
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:43,269
dreary street shouldering my bag, and

593
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:48,789
comparing the gloom towards the north withthe darkness towards the south--wherever in

594
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:54,279
your wisdom you may conclude to lodge forthe night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to

595
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:59,469
inquire the price, and don't be tooparticular.

596
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:05,639
With halting steps I paced the streets, andpassed the sign of "The Crossed Harpoons"--

597
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,006
but it looked too expensive and jollythere.

598
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:14,149
Further on, from the bright red windows ofthe "Sword-Fish Inn," there came such

599
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:18,289
fervent rays, that it seemed to have meltedthe packed snow and ice from before the

600
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,008
house, for everywhere else the congealed

601
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:27,005
frost lay ten inches thick in a hard,asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me,

602
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:32,004
when I struck my foot against the flintyprojections, because from hard, remorseless

603
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:35,083
service the soles of my boots were in amost miserable plight.

604
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:42,065
Too expensive and jolly, again thought I,pausing one moment to watch the broad glare

605
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:46,079
in the street, and hear the sounds of thetinkling glasses within.

606
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,469
But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don'tyou hear? get away from before the door;

607
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:57,099
your patched boots are stopping the way.So on I went.

608
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:02,359
I now by instinct followed the streets thattook me waterward, for there, doubtless,

609
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:06,064
were the cheapest, if not the cheeriestinns.

610
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:12,046
Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness,not houses, on either hand, and here and

611
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:16,015
there a candle, like a candle moving aboutin a tomb.

612
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:20,059
At this hour of the night, of the last dayof the week, that quarter of the town

613
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,091
proved all but deserted.

614
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:28,018
But presently I came to a smoky lightproceeding from a low, wide building, the

615
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:30,082
door of which stood invitingly open.

616
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:36,099
It had a careless look, as if it were meantfor the uses of the public; so, entering,

617
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:40,719
the first thing I did was to stumble overan ash-box in the porch.

618
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,071
Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particlesalmost choked me, are these ashes from that

619
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,006
destroyed city, Gomorrah?

620
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:54,003
But "The Crossed Harpoons," and "The Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign

621
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:55,093
of "The Trap."

622
00:47:55,093 --> 00:48:01,045
However, I picked myself up and hearing aloud voice within, pushed on and opened a

623
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:06,129
second, interior door.It seemed the great Black Parliament

624
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:07,069
sitting in Tophet.

625
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:13,599
A hundred black faces turned round in theirrows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of

626
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,056
Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.

627
00:48:16,056 --> 00:48:21,129
It was a negro church; and the preacher'stext was about the blackness of darkness,

628
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:25,003
and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.

629
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:30,239
Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The

630
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:32,045
Trap!'

631
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:37,079
Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort oflight not far from the docks, and heard a

632
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:43,034
forlorn creaking in the air; and lookingup, saw a swinging sign over the door with

633
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:45,369
a white painting upon it, faintly

634
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:51,052
representing a tall straight jet of mistyspray, and these words underneath--"The

635
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:58,379
Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that

636
00:48:58,379 --> 00:49:00,077
particular connexion, thought I.

637
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:05,068
But it is a common name in Nantucket, theysay, and I suppose this Peter here is an

638
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,489
emigrant from there.

639
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:11,989
As the light looked so dim, and the place,for the time, looked quiet enough, and the

640
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:16,027
dilapidated little wooden house itselflooked as if it might have been carted here

641
00:49:16,027 --> 00:49:19,259
from the ruins of some burnt district, and

642
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:24,609
as the swinging sign had a poverty-strickensort of creak to it, I thought that here

643
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:30,129
was the very spot for cheap lodgings, andthe best of pea coffee.

644
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:36,029
It was a queer sort of place--a gable-endedold house, one side palsied as it were, and

645
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:38,006
leaning over sadly.

646
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:44,109
It stood on a sharp bleak corner, wherethat tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a

647
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:48,039
worse howling than ever it did about poorPaul's tossed craft.

648
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:53,095
Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mightypleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with

649
00:49:53,095 --> 00:49:58,015
his feet on the hob quietly toasting forbed.

650
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:03,091
"In judging of that tempestuous wind calledEuroclydon," says an old writer--of whose

651
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:09,046
works I possess the only copy extant--"itmaketh a marvellous difference, whether

652
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:11,077
thou lookest out at it from a glass window

653
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:16,057
where the frost is all on the outside, orwhether thou observest it from that

654
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:22,044
sashless window, where the frost is on bothsides, and of which the wight Death is the

655
00:50:22,044 --> 00:50:24,619
only glazier."

656
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:29,067
True enough, thought I, as this passageoccurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou

657
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:34,099
reasonest well.Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body

658
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:36,099
of mine is the house.

659
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:40,066
What a pity they didn't stop up the chinksand the crannies though, and thrust in a

660
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:44,739
little lint here and there.But it's too late to make any improvements

661
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:45,008
now.

662
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:50,849
The universe is finished; the copestone ison, and the chips were carted off a million

663
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,053
years ago.

664
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:57,032
Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teethagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and

665
00:50:57,032 --> 00:51:01,091
shaking off his tatters with hisshiverings, he might plug up both ears with

666
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:04,999
rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth,

667
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:08,018
and yet that would not keep out thetempestuous Euroclydon.

668
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:14,042
Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his redsilken wrapper--(he had a redder one

669
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:16,067
afterwards) pooh, pooh!

670
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:21,349
What a fine frosty night; how Orionglitters; what northern lights!

671
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:27,008
Let them talk of their oriental summerclimes of everlasting conservatories; give

672
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:31,589
me the privilege of making my own summerwith my own coals.

673
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,042
But what thinks Lazarus?

674
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:38,005
Can he warm his blue hands by holding themup to the grand northern lights?

675
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:41,004
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra thanhere?

676
00:51:41,004 --> 00:51:46,219
Would he not far rather lay him downlengthwise along the line of the equator;

677
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:52,619
yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pititself, in order to keep out this frost?

678
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:57,839
Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded thereon the curbstone before the door of Dives,

679
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,081
this is more wonderful than that an icebergshould be moored to one of the Moluccas.

680
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:09,065
Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czarin an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and

681
00:52:09,065 --> 00:52:16,082
being a president of a temperance society,he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

682
00:52:16,082 --> 00:52:20,999
But no more of this blubbering now, we aregoing a-whaling, and there is plenty of

683
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:22,082
that yet to come.

684
00:52:22,082 --> 00:52:27,729
Let us scrape the ice from our frostedfeet, and see what sort of a place this

685
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:35,007
"Spouter" may be.

686
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:36,007
>

687
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:46,039
-Chapter 3.The Spouter-Inn.

688
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:52,239
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, youfound yourself in a wide, low, straggling

689
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,029
entry with old-fashioned wainscots,reminding one of the bulwarks of some

690
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:59,006
condemned old craft.

691
00:52:59,006 --> 00:53:04,549
On one side hung a very large oilpaintingso thoroughly besmoked, and every way

692
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:09,078
defaced, that in the unequal crosslights bywhich you viewed it, it was only by

693
00:53:09,078 --> 00:53:12,024
diligent study and a series of systematic

694
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:17,489
visits to it, and careful inquiry of theneighbors, that you could any way arrive at

695
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:20,099
an understanding of its purpose.

696
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:24,089
Such unaccountable masses of shades andshadows, that at first you almost thought

697
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:30,012
some ambitious young artist, in the time ofthe New England hags, had endeavored to

698
00:53:30,012 --> 00:53:32,096
delineate chaos bewitched.

699
00:53:32,096 --> 00:53:38,149
But by dint of much and earnestcontemplation, and oft repeated ponderings,

700
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:43,031
and especially by throwing open the littlewindow towards the back of the entry, you

701
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:45,027
at last come to the conclusion that such an

702
00:53:45,027 --> 00:53:51,058
idea, however wild, might not be altogetherunwarranted.

703
00:53:51,058 --> 00:53:56,077
But what most puzzled and confounded youwas a long, limber, portentous, black mass

704
00:53:56,077 --> 00:54:02,026
of something hovering in the centre of thepicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular

705
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:05,004
lines floating in a nameless yeast.

706
00:54:05,004 --> 00:54:12,081
A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly,enough to drive a nervous man distracted.

707
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:18,049
Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it

708
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:23,066
that fairly froze you to it, till youinvoluntarily took an oath with yourself to

709
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:27,459
find out what that marvellous paintingmeant.

710
00:54:27,459 --> 00:54:32,819
Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,deceptive idea would dart you through.--

711
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:37,097
It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It's the unnatural combat of the four

712
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:40,929
primal elements.--It's a blasted heath.--

713
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:47,629
It's a Hyperborean winter scene.--It's thebreaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.

714
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:52,119
But at last all these fancies yielded tothat one portentous something in the

715
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:53,052
picture's midst.

716
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:56,809
THAT once found out, and all the rest wereplain.

717
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:02,089
But stop; does it not bear a faintresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the

718
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:05,021
great leviathan himself?

719
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:10,589
In fact, the artist's design seemed this: afinal theory of my own, partly based upon

720
00:55:10,589 --> 00:55:15,046
the aggregated opinions of many agedpersons with whom I conversed upon the

721
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:16,064
subject.

722
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:21,008
The picture represents a Cape-Horner in agreat hurricane; the half-foundered ship

723
00:55:21,008 --> 00:55:27,052
weltering there with its three dismantledmasts alone visible; and an exasperated

724
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:30,042
whale, purposing to spring clean over the

725
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:36,068
craft, is in the enormous act of impalinghimself upon the three mast-heads.

726
00:55:36,068 --> 00:55:40,042
The opposite wall of this entry was hungall over with a heathenish array of

727
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:43,279
monstrous clubs and spears.

728
00:55:43,279 --> 00:55:48,899
Some were thickly set with glittering teethresembling ivory saws; others were tufted

729
00:55:48,899 --> 00:55:54,179
with knots of human hair; and one wassickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping

730
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:59,077
round like the segment made in the new-mowngrass by a long-armed mower.

731
00:55:59,077 --> 00:56:04,077
You shuddered as you gazed, and wonderedwhat monstrous cannibal and savage could

732
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:09,054
ever have gone a death-harvesting with sucha hacking, horrifying implement.

733
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:14,002
Mixed with these were rusty old whalinglances and harpoons all broken and

734
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:17,017
deformed.Some were storied weapons.

735
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:22,079
With this once long lance, now wildlyelbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain

736
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,092
kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and asunset.

737
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:32,082
And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with

738
00:56:32,082 --> 00:56:37,026
by a whale, years afterwards slain off theCape of Blanco.

739
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:42,058
The original iron entered nigh the tail,and, like a restless needle sojourning in

740
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:47,086
the body of a man, travelled full fortyfeet, and at last was found imbedded in the

741
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:49,086
hump.

742
00:56:49,086 --> 00:56:55,039
Crossing this dusky entry, and on throughyon low-arched way--cut through what in old

743
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:00,001
times must have been a great centralchimney with fireplaces all round--you

744
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,081
enter the public room.

745
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:07,056
A still duskier place is this, with suchlow ponderous beams above, and such old

746
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:12,025
wrinkled planks beneath, that you wouldalmost fancy you trod some old craft's

747
00:57:12,025 --> 00:57:14,096
cockpits, especially of such a howling

748
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:19,053
night, when this corner-anchored old arkrocked so furiously.

749
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:25,056
On one side stood a long, low, shelf-liketable covered with cracked glass cases,

750
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:30,061
filled with dusty rarities gathered fromthis wide world's remotest nooks.

751
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:36,066
Projecting from the further angle of theroom stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a

752
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:39,009
rude attempt at a right whale's head.

753
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:44,085
Be that how it may, there stands the vastarched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a

754
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,017
coach might almost drive beneath it.

755
00:57:47,017 --> 00:57:52,094
Within are shabby shelves, ranged roundwith old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in

756
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:57,089
those jaws of swift destruction, likeanother cursed Jonah (by which name indeed

757
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,039
they called him), bustles a little withered

758
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:07,006
old man, who, for their money, dearly sellsthe sailors deliriums and death.

759
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:10,005
Abominable are the tumblers into which hepours his poison.

760
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:15,048
Though true cylinders without--within, thevillanous green goggling glasses

761
00:58:15,048 --> 00:58:19,025
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheatingbottom.

762
00:58:19,025 --> 00:58:25,003
Parallel meridians rudely pecked into theglass, surround these footpads' goblets.

763
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:30,066
Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but apenny; to THIS a penny more; and so on to

764
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:36,097
the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,which you may gulp down for a shilling.

765
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:40,092
Upon entering the place I found a number ofyoung seamen gathered about a table,

766
00:58:40,092 --> 00:58:45,006
examining by a dim light divers specimensof SKRIMSHANDER.

767
00:58:45,006 --> 00:58:49,085
I sought the landlord, and telling him Idesired to be accommodated with a room,

768
00:58:49,085 --> 00:58:55,014
received for answer that his house wasfull--not a bed unoccupied.

769
00:58:55,014 --> 00:59:00,071
"But avast," he added, tapping hisforehead, "you haint no objections to

770
00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:06,063
sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye?I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd

771
00:59:06,063 --> 00:59:09,076
better get used to that sort of thing."

772
00:59:09,076 --> 00:59:14,027
I told him that I never liked to sleep twoin a bed; that if I should ever do so, it

773
00:59:14,027 --> 00:59:19,008
would depend upon who the harpooneer mightbe, and that if he (the landlord) really

774
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:22,032
had no other place for me, and the

775
00:59:22,032 --> 00:59:27,021
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable,why rather than wander further about a

776
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:31,066
strange town on so bitter a night, I wouldput up with the half of any decent man's

777
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:32,077
blanket.

778
00:59:32,077 --> 00:59:35,007
"I thought so.All right; take a seat.

779
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:41,021
Supper?--you want supper?Supper'll be ready directly."

780
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:46,094
I sat down on an old wooden settle, carvedall over like a bench on the Battery.

781
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:51,005
At one end a ruminating tar was stillfurther adorning it with his jack-knife,

782
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:56,043
stooping over and diligently working awayat the space between his legs.

783
00:59:56,043 --> 01:00:01,057
He was trying his hand at a ship under fullsail, but he didn't make much headway, I

784
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:04,029
thought.At last some four or five of us were

785
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:07,071
summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.

786
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:13,028
It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--thelandlord said he couldn't afford it.

787
01:00:13,028 --> 01:00:17,078
Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, eachin a winding sheet.

788
01:00:17,078 --> 01:00:22,004
We were fain to button up our monkeyjackets, and hold to our lips cups of

789
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:25,119
scalding tea with our half frozen fingers.

790
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,025
But the fare was of the most substantialkind--not only meat and potatoes, but

791
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:33,068
dumplings; good heavens! dumplings forsupper!

792
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:37,096
One young fellow in a green box coat,addressed himself to these dumplings in a

793
01:00:37,096 --> 01:00:43,003
most direful manner."My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have

794
01:00:43,003 --> 01:00:46,001
the nightmare to a dead sartainty."

795
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:50,073
"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint theharpooneer is it?"

796
01:00:50,073 --> 01:00:56,069
"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort ofdiabolically funny, "the harpooneer is a

797
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,072
dark complexioned chap.

798
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:05,018
He never eats dumplings, he don't--he eatsnothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."

799
01:01:05,018 --> 01:01:08,071
"The devil he does," says I."Where is that harpooneer?

800
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:09,899
Is he here?"

801
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:15,739
"He'll be here afore long," was the answer.I could not help it, but I began to feel

802
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:19,047
suspicious of this "dark complexioned"harpooneer.

803
01:01:19,047 --> 01:01:23,027
At any rate, I made up my mind that if itso turned out that we should sleep

804
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:28,034
together, he must undress and get into bedbefore I did.

805
01:01:28,034 --> 01:01:32,082
Supper over, the company went back to thebar-room, when, knowing not what else to do

806
01:01:32,082 --> 01:01:38,014
with myself, I resolved to spend the restof the evening as a looker on.

807
01:01:38,014 --> 01:01:40,085
Presently a rioting noise was heardwithout.

808
01:01:40,085 --> 01:01:44,037
Starting up, the landlord cried, "That'sthe Grampus's crew.

809
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:48,099
I seed her reported in the offing thismorning; a three years' voyage, and a full

810
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:51,075
ship.Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest

811
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:54,024
news from the Feegees."

812
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:58,052
A tramping of sea boots was heard in theentry; the door was flung open, and in

813
01:01:58,052 --> 01:02:01,021
rolled a wild set of mariners enough.

814
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:05,004
Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, andwith their heads muffled in woollen

815
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:10,038
comforters, all bedarned and ragged, andtheir beards stiff with icicles, they

816
01:02:10,038 --> 01:02:13,012
seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.

817
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:17,006
They had just landed from their boat, andthis was the first house they entered.

818
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:23,001
No wonder, then, that they made a straightwake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when

819
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:27,059
the wrinkled little old Jonah, thereofficiating, soon poured them out brimmers

820
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:28,078
all round.

821
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:34,000
One complained of a bad cold in his head,upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like

822
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,056
potion of gin and molasses, which he sworewas a sovereign cure for all colds and

823
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:42,032
catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long

824
01:02:42,032 --> 01:02:47,002
standing, or whether caught off the coastof Labrador, or on the weather side of an

825
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:49,008
ice-island.

826
01:02:49,008 --> 01:02:52,094
The liquor soon mounted into their heads,as it generally does even with the

827
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:57,097
arrantest topers newly landed from sea, andthey began capering about most

828
01:02:57,097 --> 01:02:59,084
obstreperously.

829
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:04,062
I observed, however, that one of them heldsomewhat aloof, and though he seemed

830
01:03:04,062 --> 01:03:09,068
desirous not to spoil the hilarity of hisshipmates by his own sober face, yet upon

831
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:13,027
the whole he refrained from making as muchnoise as the rest.

832
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:18,349
This man interested me at once; and sincethe sea-gods had ordained that he should

833
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:22,044
soon become my shipmate (though but asleeping-partner one, so far as this

834
01:03:22,044 --> 01:03:27,025
narrative is concerned), I will hereventure upon a little description of him.

835
01:03:27,025 --> 01:03:32,028
He stood full six feet in height, withnoble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-

836
01:03:32,028 --> 01:03:33,015
dam.

837
01:03:33,015 --> 01:03:36,026
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.

838
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:41,052
His face was deeply brown and burnt, makinghis white teeth dazzling by the contrast;

839
01:03:41,052 --> 01:03:46,002
while in the deep shadows of his eyesfloated some reminiscences that did not

840
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:48,055
seem to give him much joy.

841
01:03:48,055 --> 01:03:53,068
His voice at once announced that he was aSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I

842
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:57,056
thought he must be one of those tallmountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in

843
01:03:57,056 --> 01:03:58,057
Virginia.

844
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:03,021
When the revelry of his companions hadmounted to its height, this man slipped

845
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:09,025
away unobserved, and I saw no more of himtill he became my comrade on the sea.

846
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:14,014
In a few minutes, however, he was missed byhis shipmates, and being, it seems, for

847
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:18,094
some reason a huge favourite with them,they raised a cry of "Bulkington!

848
01:04:18,094 --> 01:04:25,025
Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and dartedout of the house in pursuit of him.

849
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:30,002
It was now about nine o'clock, and the roomseeming almost supernaturally quiet after

850
01:04:30,002 --> 01:04:34,081
these orgies, I began to congratulatemyself upon a little plan that had occurred

851
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:39,229
to me just previous to the entrance of theseamen.

852
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:44,031
No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.In fact, you would a good deal rather not

853
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,044
sleep with your own brother.

854
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:50,049
I don't know how it is, but people like tobe private when they are sleeping.

855
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:54,081
And when it comes to sleeping with anunknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a

856
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:59,007
strange town, and that stranger aharpooneer, then your objections

857
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,089
indefinitely multiply.

858
01:05:01,089 --> 01:05:06,095
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as asailor should sleep two in a bed, more than

859
01:05:06,095 --> 01:05:12,159
anybody else; for sailors no more sleep twoin a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do

860
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,005
ashore.

861
01:05:13,005 --> 01:05:18,009
To be sure they all sleep together in oneapartment, but you have your own hammock,

862
01:05:18,009 --> 01:05:23,006
and cover yourself with your own blanket,and sleep in your own skin.

863
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:26,081
The more I pondered over this harpooneer,the more I abominated the thought of

864
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:27,092
sleeping with him.

865
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:32,042
It was fair to presume that being aharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the

866
01:05:32,042 --> 01:05:37,025
case might be, would not be of the tidiest,certainly none of the finest.

867
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:39,064
I began to twitch all over.

868
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:43,083
Besides, it was getting late, and my decentharpooneer ought to be home and going

869
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,071
bedwards.

870
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:49,078
Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me atmidnight--how could I tell from what vile

871
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:53,063
hole he had been coming?"Landlord!

872
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:57,409
I've changed my mind about thatharpooneer.--I shan't sleep with him.

873
01:05:57,409 --> 01:06:00,031
I'll try the bench here."

874
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:05,009
"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spareye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it's a

875
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:10,012
plaguy rough board here"--feeling of theknots and notches.

876
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:15,063
"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got acarpenter's plane there in the bar--wait,

877
01:06:15,063 --> 01:06:18,034
I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."

878
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:23,053
So saying he procured the plane; and withhis old silk handkerchief first dusting the

879
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:29,069
bench, vigorously set to planing away at mybed, the while grinning like an ape.

880
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:33,093
The shavings flew right and left; till atlast the plane-iron came bump against an

881
01:06:33,093 --> 01:06:35,031
indestructible knot.

882
01:06:35,031 --> 01:06:40,004
The landlord was near spraining his wrist,and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--

883
01:06:40,004 --> 01:06:44,061
the bed was soft enough to suit me, and Idid not know how all the planing in the

884
01:06:44,061 --> 01:06:47,051
world could make eider down of a pineplank.

885
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:51,028
So gathering up the shavings with anothergrin, and throwing them into the great

886
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:55,659
stove in the middle of the room, he wentabout his business, and left me in a brown

887
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:57,062
study.

888
01:06:57,062 --> 01:07:02,001
I now took the measure of the bench, andfound that it was a foot too short; but

889
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,409
that could be mended with a chair.

890
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:08,099
But it was a foot too narrow, and the otherbench in the room was about four inches

891
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:12,002
higher than the planed one--so there was noyoking them.

892
01:07:12,002 --> 01:07:16,659
I then placed the first bench lengthwisealong the only clear space against the

893
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:21,099
wall, leaving a little interval between,for my back to settle down in.

894
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:26,042
But I soon found that there came such adraught of cold air over me from under the

895
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:31,009
sill of the window, that this plan wouldnever do at all, especially as another

896
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,019
current from the rickety door met the one

897
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:38,005
from the window, and both together formed aseries of small whirlwinds in the immediate

898
01:07:38,005 --> 01:07:42,019
vicinity of the spot where I had thought tospend the night.

899
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:47,093
The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I,but stop, couldn't I steal a march on him--

900
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:52,082
bolt his door inside, and jump into hisbed, not to be wakened by the most violent

901
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:54,012
knockings?

902
01:07:54,012 --> 01:07:58,003
It seemed no bad idea; but upon secondthoughts I dismissed it.

903
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:02,028
For who could tell but what the nextmorning, so soon as I popped out of the

904
01:08:02,028 --> 01:08:07,219
room, the harpooneer might be standing inthe entry, all ready to knock me down!

905
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:11,062
Still, looking round me again, and seeingno possible chance of spending a sufferable

906
01:08:11,062 --> 01:08:16,092
night unless in some other person's bed, Ibegan to think that after all I might be

907
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:22,159
cherishing unwarrantable prejudices againstthis unknown harpooneer.

908
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:26,044
Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must bedropping in before long.

909
01:08:26,044 --> 01:08:30,081
I'll have a good look at him then, andperhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows

910
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:33,093
after all--there's no telling.

911
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:38,015
But though the other boarders kept comingin by ones, twos, and threes, and going to

912
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:44,051
bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer."Landlord!" said I, "what sort of a chap is

913
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:47,056
he--does he always keep such late hours?"

914
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:52,729
It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.The landlord chuckled again with his lean

915
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:58,039
chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickledat something beyond my comprehension.

916
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:04,349
"No," he answered, "generally he's an earlybird--airley to bed and airley to rise--

917
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,083
yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.

918
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:11,039
But to-night he went out a peddling, yousee, and I don't see what on airth keeps

919
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,021
him so late, unless, may be, he can't sellhis head."

920
01:09:14,021 --> 01:09:20,063
"Can't sell his head?--What sort of abamboozingly story is this you are telling

921
01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:23,279
me?" getting into a towering rage.

922
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,000
"Do you pretend to say, landlord, that thisharpooneer is actually engaged this blessed

923
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,599
Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning,in peddling his head around this town?"

924
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:38,084
"That's precisely it," said the landlord,"and I told him he couldn't sell it here,

925
01:09:38,084 --> 01:09:43,043
the market's overstocked.""With what?" shouted I.

926
01:09:43,043 --> 01:09:47,139
"With heads to be sure; ain't there toomany heads in the world?"

927
01:09:47,139 --> 01:09:53,359
"I tell you what it is, landlord," said Iquite calmly, "you'd better stop spinning

928
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,055
that yarn to me--I'm not green."

929
01:09:56,055 --> 01:10:01,649
"May be not," taking out a stick andwhittling a toothpick, "but I rayther guess

930
01:10:01,649 --> 01:10:06,719
you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneerhears you a slanderin' his head."

931
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,065
"I'll break it for him," said I, now flyinginto a passion again at this unaccountable

932
01:10:11,065 --> 01:10:16,809
farrago of the landlord's."It's broke a'ready," said he.

933
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:20,249
"Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"

934
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:25,066
"Sartain, and that's the very reason hecan't sell it, I guess."

935
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:32,027
"Landlord," said I, going up to him as coolas Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm--"landlord,

936
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,589
stop whittling.

937
01:10:33,589 --> 01:10:37,066
You and I must understand one another, andthat too without delay.

938
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:42,619
I come to your house and want a bed; youtell me you can only give me half a one;

939
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:45,055
that the other half belongs to a certainharpooneer.

940
01:10:45,055 --> 01:10:49,079
And about this harpooneer, whom I have notyet seen, you persist in telling me the

941
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:54,629
most mystifying and exasperating storiestending to beget in me an uncomfortable

942
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:57,002
feeling towards the man whom you design for

943
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:01,589
my bedfellow--a sort of connexion,landlord, which is an intimate and

944
01:11:01,589 --> 01:11:04,003
confidential one in the highest degree.

945
01:11:04,003 --> 01:11:09,759
I now demand of you to speak out and tellme who and what this harpooneer is, and

946
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:13,689
whether I shall be in all respects safe tospend the night with him.

947
01:11:13,689 --> 01:11:18,003
And in the first place, you will be so goodas to unsay that story about selling his

948
01:11:18,003 --> 01:11:23,459
head, which if true I take to be goodevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad,

949
01:11:23,459 --> 01:11:26,068
and I've no idea of sleeping with a madman;

950
01:11:26,068 --> 01:11:33,689
and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU,sir, by trying to induce me to do so

951
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:38,329
knowingly, would thereby render yourselfliable to a criminal prosecution."

952
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:45,589
"Wall," said the landlord, fetching a longbreath, "that's a purty long sarmon for a

953
01:11:45,589 --> 01:11:47,959
chap that rips a little now and then.

954
01:11:47,959 --> 01:11:53,559
But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneerI have been tellin' you of has just arrived

955
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:58,079
from the south seas, where he bought up alot of 'balmed New Zealand heads (great

956
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:01,709
curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em

957
01:12:01,709 --> 01:12:06,469
but one, and that one he's trying to sellto-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it

958
01:12:06,469 --> 01:12:10,559
would not do to be sellin' human headsabout the streets when folks is goin' to

959
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,079
churches.

960
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:16,469
He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stoppedhim just as he was goin' out of the door

961
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:22,989
with four heads strung on a string, for allthe airth like a string of inions."

962
01:12:22,989 --> 01:12:27,249
This account cleared up the otherwiseunaccountable mystery, and showed that the

963
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:31,053
landlord, after all, had had no idea offooling me--but at the same time what could

964
01:12:31,053 --> 01:12:34,059
I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a

965
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:38,379
Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath,engaged in such a cannibal business as

966
01:12:38,379 --> 01:12:44,369
selling the heads of dead idolators?"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer

967
01:12:44,369 --> 01:12:46,749
is a dangerous man."

968
01:12:46,749 --> 01:12:52,309
"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder."But come, it's getting dreadful late, you

969
01:12:52,309 --> 01:12:57,749
had better be turning flukes--it's a nicebed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the

970
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:59,629
night we were spliced.

971
01:12:59,629 --> 01:13:04,109
There's plenty of room for two to kickabout in that bed; it's an almighty big bed

972
01:13:04,109 --> 01:13:05,099
that.

973
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:09,014
Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to putour Sam and little Johnny in the foot of

974
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,199
it.

975
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:14,559
But I got a dreaming and sprawling aboutone night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on

976
01:13:14,559 --> 01:13:20,559
the floor, and came near breaking his arm.Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.

977
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:25,619
Come along here, I'll give ye a glim in ajiffy;" and so saying he lighted a candle

978
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:28,052
and held it towards me, offering to leadthe way.

979
01:13:28,052 --> 01:13:33,065
But I stood irresolute; when looking at aclock in the corner, he exclaimed "I vum

980
01:13:33,065 --> 01:13:38,319
it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneerto-night; he's come to anchor somewhere--

981
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,369
come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"

982
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:47,004
I considered the matter a moment, and thenup stairs we went, and I was ushered into a

983
01:13:47,004 --> 01:13:53,579
small room, cold as a clam, and furnished,sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost

984
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:57,929
big enough indeed for any four harpooneersto sleep abreast.

985
01:13:57,929 --> 01:14:02,709
"There," said the landlord, placing thecandle on a crazy old sea chest that did

986
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:07,053
double duty as a wash-stand and centretable; "there, make yourself comfortable

987
01:14:07,053 --> 01:14:09,719
now, and good night to ye."

988
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:14,599
I turned round from eyeing the bed, but hehad disappeared.

989
01:14:14,599 --> 01:14:17,092
Folding back the counterpane, I stoopedover the bed.

990
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:22,709
Though none of the most elegant, it yetstood the scrutiny tolerably well.

991
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:26,939
I then glanced round the room; and besidesthe bedstead and centre table, could see no

992
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:32,449
other furniture belonging to the place, buta rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered

993
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:35,699
fireboard representing a man striking awhale.

994
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:40,199
Of things not properly belonging to theroom, there was a hammock lashed up, and

995
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:44,689
thrown upon the floor in one corner; also alarge seaman's bag, containing the

996
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:49,027
harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu ofa land trunk.

997
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:53,969
Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandishbone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-

998
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:59,059
place, and a tall harpoon standing at thehead of the bed.

999
01:14:59,059 --> 01:15:01,003
But what is this on the chest?

1000
01:15:01,003 --> 01:15:05,969
I took it up, and held it close to thelight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried

1001
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:10,589
every way possible to arrive at somesatisfactory conclusion concerning it.

1002
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:15,029
I can compare it to nothing but a largedoor mat, ornamented at the edges with

1003
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:20,489
little tinkling tags something like thestained porcupine quills round an Indian

1004
01:15:20,489 --> 01:15:21,949
moccasin.

1005
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:25,869
There was a hole or slit in the middle ofthis mat, as you see the same in South

1006
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:27,064
American ponchos.

1007
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:31,969
But could it be possible that any soberharpooneer would get into a door mat, and

1008
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:36,028
parade the streets of any Christian town inthat sort of guise?

1009
01:15:36,028 --> 01:15:41,003
I put it on, to try it, and it weighed medown like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy

1010
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:45,709
and thick, and I thought a little damp, asthough this mysterious harpooneer had been

1011
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:47,091
wearing it of a rainy day.

1012
01:15:47,091 --> 01:15:52,027
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuckagainst the wall, and I never saw such a

1013
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:55,009
sight in my life.I tore myself out of it in such a hurry

1014
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:59,059
that I gave myself a kink in the neck.

1015
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:03,099
I sat down on the side of the bed, andcommenced thinking about this head-peddling

1016
01:16:03,099 --> 01:16:05,679
harpooneer, and his door mat.

1017
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,559
After thinking some time on the bed-side,I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and

1018
01:16:10,559 --> 01:16:13,249
then stood in the middle of the roomthinking.

1019
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:17,016
I then took off my coat, and thought alittle more in my shirt sleeves.

1020
01:16:17,016 --> 01:16:21,969
But beginning to feel very cold now, halfundressed as I was, and remembering what

1021
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:26,449
the landlord said about the harpooneer'snot coming home at all that night, it being

1022
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:29,249
so very late, I made no more ado, but

1023
01:16:29,249 --> 01:16:34,129
jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, andthen blowing out the light tumbled into

1024
01:16:34,129 --> 01:16:39,004
bed, and commended myself to the care ofheaven.

1025
01:16:39,004 --> 01:16:43,017
Whether that mattress was stuffed withcorn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no

1026
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:48,429
telling, but I rolled about a good deal,and could not sleep for a long time.

1027
01:16:48,429 --> 01:16:53,049
At last I slid off into a light doze, andhad pretty nearly made a good offing

1028
01:16:53,049 --> 01:16:57,067
towards the land of Nod, when I heard aheavy footfall in the passage, and saw a

1029
01:16:57,067 --> 01:17:01,559
glimmer of light come into the room fromunder the door.

1030
01:17:01,559 --> 01:17:06,859
Lord save me, thinks I, that must be theharpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.

1031
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:11,959
But I lay perfectly still, and resolved notto say a word till spoken to.

1032
01:17:11,959 --> 01:17:16,489
Holding a light in one hand, and thatidentical New Zealand head in the other,

1033
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:20,089
the stranger entered the room, and withoutlooking towards the bed, placed his candle

1034
01:17:20,089 --> 01:17:23,299
a good way off from me on the floor in one

1035
01:17:23,299 --> 01:17:28,069
corner, and then began working away at theknotted cords of the large bag I before

1036
01:17:28,069 --> 01:17:30,089
spoke of as being in the room.

1037
01:17:30,089 --> 01:17:35,004
I was all eagerness to see his face, but hekept it averted for some time while

1038
01:17:35,004 --> 01:17:40,209
employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.This accomplished, however, he turned

1039
01:17:40,209 --> 01:17:43,619
round--when, good heavens! what a sight!

1040
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:47,719
Such a face!It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour,

1041
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:52,009
here and there stuck over with largeblackish looking squares.

1042
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:56,559
Yes, it's just as I thought, he's aterrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,

1043
01:17:56,559 --> 01:18:00,369
got dreadfully cut, and here he is, justfrom the surgeon.

1044
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:04,319
But at that moment he chanced to turn hisface so towards the light, that I plainly

1045
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:10,199
saw they could not be sticking-plasters atall, those black squares on his cheeks.

1046
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,719
They were stains of some sort or other.

1047
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,729
At first I knew not what to make of this;but soon an inkling of the truth occurred

1048
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:17,969
to me.

1049
01:18:17,969 --> 01:18:23,249
I remembered a story of a white man--awhaleman too--who, falling among the

1050
01:18:23,249 --> 01:18:25,989
cannibals, had been tattooed by them.

1051
01:18:25,989 --> 01:18:29,839
I concluded that this harpooneer, in thecourse of his distant voyages, must have

1052
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:34,054
met with a similar adventure.And what is it, thought I, after all!

1053
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:39,299
It's only his outside; a man can be honestin any sort of skin.

1054
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:43,859
But then, what to make of his unearthlycomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying

1055
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:48,439
round about, and completely independent ofthe squares of tattooing.

1056
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:53,119
To be sure, it might be nothing but a goodcoat of tropical tanning; but I never heard

1057
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:58,002
of a hot sun's tanning a white man into apurplish yellow one.

1058
01:18:58,002 --> 01:19:01,609
However, I had never been in the SouthSeas; and perhaps the sun there produced

1059
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:04,999
these extraordinary effects upon the skin.

1060
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:08,077
Now, while all these ideas were passingthrough me like lightning, this harpooneer

1061
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,109
never noticed me at all.

1062
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:15,579
But, after some difficulty having openedhis bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and

1063
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:20,129
presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk,and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.

1064
01:19:20,129 --> 01:19:24,549
Placing these on the old chest in themiddle of the room, he then took the New

1065
01:19:24,549 --> 01:19:30,089
Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--andcrammed it down into the bag.

1066
01:19:30,089 --> 01:19:34,979
He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh

1067
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,028
surprise.

1068
01:19:36,028 --> 01:19:40,066
There was no hair on his head--none tospeak of at least--nothing but a small

1069
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:45,089
scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.His bald purplish head now looked for all

1070
01:19:45,089 --> 01:19:48,065
the world like a mildewed skull.

1071
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:52,041
Had not the stranger stood between me andthe door, I would have bolted out of it

1072
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:55,349
quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.

1073
01:19:55,349 --> 01:19:59,609
Even as it was, I thought something ofslipping out of the window, but it was the

1074
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:01,041
second floor back.

1075
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:05,759
I am no coward, but what to make of thishead-peddling purple rascal altogether

1076
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,979
passed my comprehension.

1077
01:20:07,979 --> 01:20:13,239
Ignorance is the parent of fear, and beingcompletely nonplussed and confounded about

1078
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:17,829
the stranger, I confess I was now as muchafraid of him as if it was the devil

1079
01:20:17,829 --> 01:20:21,719
himself who had thus broken into my room atthe dead of night.

1080
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:26,259
In fact, I was so afraid of him that I wasnot game enough just then to address him,

1081
01:20:26,259 --> 01:20:32,479
and demand a satisfactory answer concerningwhat seemed inexplicable in him.

1082
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,599
Meanwhile, he continued the business ofundressing, and at last showed his chest

1083
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:37,579
and arms.

1084
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:41,829
As I live, these covered parts of him werecheckered with the same squares as his

1085
01:20:41,829 --> 01:20:47,689
face; his back, too, was all over the samedark squares; he seemed to have been in a

1086
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:52,004
Thirty Years' War, and just escaped from itwith a sticking-plaster shirt.

1087
01:20:52,004 --> 01:20:57,199
Still more, his very legs were marked, asif a parcel of dark green frogs were

1088
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,078
running up the trunks of young palms.

1089
01:20:59,078 --> 01:21:04,349
It was now quite plain that he must be someabominable savage or other shipped aboard

1090
01:21:04,349 --> 01:21:09,004
of a whaleman in the South Seas, and solanded in this Christian country.

1091
01:21:09,004 --> 01:21:10,629
I quaked to think of it.

1092
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:14,929
A peddler of heads too--perhaps the headsof his own brothers.

1093
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:19,809
He might take a fancy to mine--heavens!look at that tomahawk!

1094
01:21:19,809 --> 01:21:23,719
But there was no time for shuddering, fornow the savage went about something that

1095
01:21:23,719 --> 01:21:28,004
completely fascinated my attention, andconvinced me that he must indeed be a

1096
01:21:28,004 --> 01:21:28,989
heathen.

1097
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:34,003
Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, ordreadnaught, which he had previously hung

1098
01:21:34,003 --> 01:21:38,319
on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, andproduced at length a curious little

1099
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,049
deformed image with a hunch on its back,

1100
01:21:41,049 --> 01:21:45,079
and exactly the colour of a three days' oldCongo baby.

1101
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:49,609
Remembering the embalmed head, at first Ialmost thought that this black manikin was

1102
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:52,004
a real baby preserved in some similarmanner.

1103
01:21:52,004 --> 01:21:56,749
But seeing that it was not at all limber,and that it glistened a good deal like

1104
01:21:56,749 --> 01:22:01,009
polished ebony, I concluded that it must benothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it

1105
01:22:01,009 --> 01:22:03,439
proved to be.

1106
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:08,219
For now the savage goes up to the emptyfire-place, and removing the papered fire-

1107
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:13,009
board, sets up this little hunch-backedimage, like a tenpin, between the andirons.

1108
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:18,014
The chimney jambs and all the bricks insidewere very sooty, so that I thought this

1109
01:22:18,014 --> 01:22:23,929
fire-place made a very appropriate littleshrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

1110
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:28,299
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the halfhidden image, feeling but ill at ease

1111
01:22:28,299 --> 01:22:31,839
meantime--to see what was next to follow.

1112
01:22:31,839 --> 01:22:36,003
First he takes about a double handful ofshavings out of his grego pocket, and

1113
01:22:36,003 --> 01:22:41,041
places them carefully before the idol; thenlaying a bit of ship biscuit on top and

1114
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,065
applying the flame from the lamp, he

1115
01:22:43,065 --> 01:22:46,999
kindled the shavings into a sacrificialblaze.

1116
01:22:46,999 --> 01:22:51,959
Presently, after many hasty snatches intothe fire, and still hastier withdrawals of

1117
01:22:51,959 --> 01:22:57,089
his fingers (whereby he seemed to bescorching them badly), he at last succeeded

1118
01:22:57,089 --> 01:22:59,041
in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing

1119
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:04,016
off the heat and ashes a little, he made apolite offer of it to the little negro.

1120
01:23:04,016 --> 01:23:09,629
But the little devil did not seem to fancysuch dry sort of fare at all; he never

1121
01:23:09,629 --> 01:23:11,449
moved his lips.

1122
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:16,419
All these strange antics were accompaniedby still stranger guttural noises from the

1123
01:23:16,419 --> 01:23:21,189
devotee, who seemed to be praying in asing-song or else singing some pagan

1124
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:23,699
psalmody or other, during which his face

1125
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,809
twitched about in the most unnaturalmanner.

1126
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:32,179
At last extinguishing the fire, he took theidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it

1127
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:37,002
again in his grego pocket as carelessly asif he were a sportsman bagging a dead

1128
01:23:37,002 --> 01:23:38,959
woodcock.

1129
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:43,129
All these queer proceedings increased myuncomfortableness, and seeing him now

1130
01:23:43,129 --> 01:23:47,009
exhibiting strong symptoms of concludinghis business operations, and jumping into

1131
01:23:47,009 --> 01:23:50,003
bed with me, I thought it was high time,

1132
01:23:50,003 --> 01:23:54,479
now or never, before the light was put out,to break the spell in which I had so long

1133
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:58,319
been bound.But the interval I spent in deliberating

1134
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:00,459
what to say, was a fatal one.

1135
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:05,003
Taking up his tomahawk from the table, heexamined the head of it for an instant, and

1136
01:24:05,003 --> 01:24:08,849
then holding it to the light, with hismouth at the handle, he puffed out great

1137
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:11,689
clouds of tobacco smoke.

1138
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:15,849
The next moment the light was extinguished,and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between

1139
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:18,299
his teeth, sprang into bed with me.

1140
01:24:18,299 --> 01:24:22,999
I sang out, I could not help it now; andgiving a sudden grunt of astonishment he

1141
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:25,089
began feeling me.

1142
01:24:25,089 --> 01:24:29,129
Stammering out something, I knew not what,I rolled away from him against the wall,

1143
01:24:29,129 --> 01:24:34,059
and then conjured him, whoever or whateverhe might be, to keep quiet, and let me get

1144
01:24:34,059 --> 01:24:35,749
up and light the lamp again.

1145
01:24:35,749 --> 01:24:40,449
But his guttural responses satisfied me atonce that he but ill comprehended my

1146
01:24:40,449 --> 01:24:45,369
meaning."Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you

1147
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:48,379
no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e."

1148
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:53,059
And so saying the lighted tomahawk beganflourishing about me in the dark.

1149
01:24:53,059 --> 01:24:56,949
"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!"shouted I.

1150
01:24:56,949 --> 01:25:01,679
"Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!"

1151
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:08,027
"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me,I kill-e!" again growled the cannibal,

1152
01:25:08,027 --> 01:25:12,249
while his horrid flourishings of thetomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes

1153
01:25:12,249 --> 01:25:15,129
about me till I thought my linen would geton fire.

1154
01:25:15,129 --> 01:25:19,629
But thank heaven, at that moment thelandlord came into the room light in hand,

1155
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:21,959
and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.

1156
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:28,009
"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinningagain, "Queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair

1157
01:25:28,009 --> 01:25:30,179
of your head."

1158
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:34,459
"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and whydidn't you tell me that that infernal

1159
01:25:34,459 --> 01:25:36,719
harpooneer was a cannibal?"

1160
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,016
"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye,he was a peddlin' heads around town?--but

1161
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,219
turn flukes again and go to sleep.

1162
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:51,079
Queequeg, look here--you sabbee me, Isabbee--you this man sleepe you--you

1163
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,099
sabbee?"

1164
01:25:52,099 --> 01:25:57,499
"Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg,puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in

1165
01:25:57,499 --> 01:25:59,379
bed.

1166
01:25:59,379 --> 01:26:04,439
"You gettee in," he added, motioning to mewith his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes

1167
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:08,439
to one side.He really did this in not only a civil but

1168
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:11,219
a really kind and charitable way.

1169
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:15,479
I stood looking at him a moment.For all his tattooings he was on the whole

1170
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:17,077
a clean, comely looking cannibal.

1171
01:26:17,077 --> 01:26:22,169
What's all this fuss I have been makingabout, thought I to myself--the man's a

1172
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:26,699
human being just as I am: he has just asmuch reason to fear me, as I have to be

1173
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:28,015
afraid of him.

1174
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:33,199
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than adrunken Christian.

1175
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:37,569
"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash histomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you

1176
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:42,429
call it; tell him to stop smoking, inshort, and I will turn in with him.

1177
01:26:42,429 --> 01:26:45,072
But I don't fancy having a man smoking inbed with me.

1178
01:26:45,072 --> 01:26:49,024
It's dangerous.Besides, I ain't insured."

1179
01:26:49,024 --> 01:26:54,028
This being told to Queequeg, he at oncecomplied, and again politely motioned me to

1180
01:26:54,028 --> 01:26:59,077
get into bed--rolling over to one side asmuch as to say--"I won't touch a leg of

1181
01:26:59,077 --> 01:27:00,859
ye."

1182
01:27:00,859 --> 01:27:04,369
"Good night, landlord," said I, "you maygo."

1183
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:10,007
I turned in, and never slept better in mylife.

1184
01:27:10,007 --> 01:27:11,007
>

1185
01:27:11,007 --> 01:27:24,066
-Chapter 4.The Counterpane.

1186
01:27:24,066 --> 01:27:29,045
Upon waking next morning about daylight, Ifound Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the

1187
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:34,056
most loving and affectionate manner.You had almost thought I had been his wife.

1188
01:27:34,056 --> 01:27:39,001
The counterpane was of patchwork, full ofodd little parti-coloured squares and

1189
01:27:39,001 --> 01:27:45,025
triangles; and this arm of his tattooed allover with an interminable Cretan labyrinth

1190
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:48,002
of a figure, no two parts of which were of

1191
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:53,059
one precise shade--owing I suppose to hiskeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in

1192
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:59,029
sun and shade, his shirt sleevesirregularly rolled up at various times--

1193
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:01,054
this same arm of his, I say, looked for all

1194
01:28:01,054 --> 01:28:05,094
the world like a strip of that samepatchwork quilt.

1195
01:28:05,094 --> 01:28:10,037
Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm didwhen I first awoke, I could hardly tell it

1196
01:28:10,037 --> 01:28:15,001
from the quilt, they so blended their huestogether; and it was only by the sense of

1197
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:19,055
weight and pressure that I could tell thatQueequeg was hugging me.

1198
01:28:19,055 --> 01:28:24,044
My sensations were strange.Let me try to explain them.

1199
01:28:24,044 --> 01:28:28,076
When I was a child, I well remember asomewhat similar circumstance that befell

1200
01:28:28,076 --> 01:28:34,037
me; whether it was a reality or a dream, Inever could entirely settle.

1201
01:28:34,037 --> 01:28:35,929
The circumstance was this.

1202
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:40,094
I had been cutting up some caper or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the

1203
01:28:40,094 --> 01:28:46,062
chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do afew days previous; and my stepmother who,

1204
01:28:46,062 --> 01:28:49,005
somehow or other, was all the time whipping

1205
01:28:49,005 --> 01:28:53,989
me, or sending me to bed supperless,--mymother dragged me by the legs out of the

1206
01:28:53,989 --> 01:28:58,709
chimney and packed me off to bed, though itwas only two o'clock in the afternoon of

1207
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:03,054
the 21st June, the longest day in the yearin our hemisphere.

1208
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:05,559
I felt dreadfully.

1209
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:09,009
But there was no help for it, so up stairsI went to my little room in the third

1210
01:29:09,009 --> 01:29:15,499
floor, undressed myself as slowly aspossible so as to kill time, and with a

1211
01:29:15,499 --> 01:29:18,389
bitter sigh got between the sheets.

1212
01:29:18,389 --> 01:29:23,072
I lay there dismally calculating thatsixteen entire hours must elapse before I

1213
01:29:23,072 --> 01:29:29,034
could hope for a resurrection.Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back

1214
01:29:29,034 --> 01:29:31,002
ached to think of it.

1215
01:29:31,002 --> 01:29:35,084
And it was so light too; the sun shining inat the window, and a great rattling of

1216
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:40,076
coaches in the streets, and the sound ofgay voices all over the house.

1217
01:29:40,076 --> 01:29:46,026
I felt worse and worse--at last I got up,dressed, and softly going down in my

1218
01:29:46,026 --> 01:29:51,051
stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother,and suddenly threw myself at her feet,

1219
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:53,095
beseeching her as a particular favour to

1220
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:57,098
give me a good slippering for mymisbehaviour; anything indeed but

1221
01:29:57,098 --> 01:30:02,082
condemning me to lie abed such anunendurable length of time.

1222
01:30:02,082 --> 01:30:07,043
But she was the best and most conscientiousof stepmothers, and back I had to go to my

1223
01:30:07,043 --> 01:30:08,082
room.

1224
01:30:08,082 --> 01:30:13,011
For several hours I lay there broad awake,feeling a great deal worse than I have ever

1225
01:30:13,011 --> 01:30:17,073
done since, even from the greatestsubsequent misfortunes.

1226
01:30:17,073 --> 01:30:23,063
At last I must have fallen into a troublednightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from

1227
01:30:23,063 --> 01:30:29,021
it--half steeped in dreams--I opened myeyes, and the before sun-lit room was now

1228
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:31,057
wrapped in outer darkness.

1229
01:30:31,057 --> 01:30:36,003
Instantly I felt a shock running throughall my frame; nothing was to be seen, and

1230
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:42,065
nothing was to be heard; but a supernaturalhand seemed placed in mine.

1231
01:30:42,065 --> 01:30:48,039
My arm hung over the counterpane, and thenameless, unimaginable, silent form or

1232
01:30:48,039 --> 01:30:54,013
phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemedclosely seated by my bed-side.

1233
01:30:54,013 --> 01:30:59,038
For what seemed ages piled on ages, I laythere, frozen with the most awful fears,

1234
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:05,041
not daring to drag away my hand; yet everthinking that if I could but stir it one

1235
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:08,011
single inch, the horrid spell would bebroken.

1236
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:14,023
I knew not how this consciousness at lastglided away from me; but waking in the

1237
01:31:14,023 --> 01:31:18,004
morning, I shudderingly remembered it all,and for days and weeks and months

1238
01:31:18,004 --> 01:31:23,073
afterwards I lost myself in confoundingattempts to explain the mystery.

1239
01:31:23,073 --> 01:31:28,088
Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzlemyself with it.

1240
01:31:28,088 --> 01:31:34,016
Now, take away the awful fear, and mysensations at feeling the supernatural hand

1241
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:38,051
in mine were very similar, in theirstrangeness, to those which I experienced

1242
01:31:38,051 --> 01:31:43,058
on waking up and seeing Queequeg's paganarm thrown round me.

1243
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:48,014
But at length all the past night's eventssoberly recurred, one by one, in fixed

1244
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:52,073
reality, and then I lay only alive to thecomical predicament.

1245
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:58,085
For though I tried to move his arm--unlockhis bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he

1246
01:31:58,085 --> 01:32:03,095
was, he still hugged me tightly, as thoughnaught but death should part us twain.

1247
01:32:03,095 --> 01:32:09,008
I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--buthis only answer was a snore.

1248
01:32:09,008 --> 01:32:14,079
I then rolled over, my neck feeling as ifit were in a horse-collar; and suddenly

1249
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:16,064
felt a slight scratch.

1250
01:32:16,064 --> 01:32:21,073
Throwing aside the counterpane, there laythe tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side,

1251
01:32:21,073 --> 01:32:24,029
as if it were a hatchet-faced baby.

1252
01:32:24,029 --> 01:32:29,045
A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abedhere in a strange house in the broad day,

1253
01:32:29,045 --> 01:32:34,069
with a cannibal and a tomahawk!"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness,

1254
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:36,094
Queequeg, wake!"

1255
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:41,086
At length, by dint of much wriggling, andloud and incessant expostulations upon the

1256
01:32:41,086 --> 01:32:47,081
unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow malein that matrimonial sort of style, I

1257
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:50,048
succeeded in extracting a grunt; and

1258
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:55,003
presently, he drew back his arm, shookhimself all over like a Newfoundland dog

1259
01:32:55,003 --> 01:33:00,021
just from the water, and sat up in bed,stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and

1260
01:33:00,021 --> 01:33:01,099
rubbing his eyes as if he did not

1261
01:33:01,099 --> 01:33:06,073
altogether remember how I came to be there,though a dim consciousness of knowing

1262
01:33:06,073 --> 01:33:10,074
something about me seemed slowly dawningover him.

1263
01:33:10,074 --> 01:33:16,005
Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, havingno serious misgivings now, and bent upon

1264
01:33:16,005 --> 01:33:19,071
narrowly observing so curious a creature.

1265
01:33:19,071 --> 01:33:24,027
When, at last, his mind seemed made uptouching the character of his bedfellow,

1266
01:33:24,027 --> 01:33:29,002
and he became, as it were, reconciled tothe fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and

1267
01:33:29,002 --> 01:33:31,071
by certain signs and sounds gave me to

1268
01:33:31,071 --> 01:33:36,022
understand that, if it pleased me, he woulddress first and then leave me to dress

1269
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:40,033
afterwards, leaving the whole apartment tomyself.

1270
01:33:40,033 --> 01:33:44,043
Thinks I, Queequeg, under thecircumstances, this is a very civilized

1271
01:33:44,043 --> 01:33:49,099
overture; but, the truth is, these savageshave an innate sense of delicacy, say what

1272
01:33:49,099 --> 01:33:54,026
you will; it is marvellous how essentiallypolite they are.

1273
01:33:54,026 --> 01:33:58,029
I pay this particular compliment toQueequeg, because he treated me with so

1274
01:33:58,029 --> 01:34:03,057
much civility and consideration, while Iwas guilty of great rudeness; staring at

1275
01:34:03,057 --> 01:34:05,058
him from the bed, and watching all his

1276
01:34:05,058 --> 01:34:11,014
toilette motions; for the time my curiositygetting the better of my breeding.

1277
01:34:11,014 --> 01:34:16,899
Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don'tsee every day, he and his ways were well

1278
01:34:16,899 --> 01:34:20,089
worth unusual regarding.

1279
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:26,899
He commenced dressing at top by donning hisbeaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and

1280
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:30,091
then--still minus his trowsers--he huntedup his boots.

1281
01:34:30,091 --> 01:34:34,081
What under the heavens he did it for, Icannot tell, but his next movement was to

1282
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:41,041
crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed; when, from sundry violent

1283
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,069
gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was

1284
01:34:43,069 --> 01:34:49,119
hard at work booting himself; though by nolaw of propriety that I ever heard of, is

1285
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:53,007
any man required to be private when puttingon his boots.

1286
01:34:53,007 --> 01:34:58,000
But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature inthe transition stage--neither caterpillar

1287
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,073
nor butterfly.

1288
01:34:59,073 --> 01:35:04,001
He was just enough civilized to show offhis outlandishness in the strangest

1289
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:08,339
possible manners.His education was not yet completed.

1290
01:35:08,339 --> 01:35:10,399
He was an undergraduate.

1291
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,004
If he had not been a small degreecivilized, he very probably would not have

1292
01:35:14,004 --> 01:35:18,085
troubled himself with boots at all; butthen, if he had not been still a savage, he

1293
01:35:18,085 --> 01:35:22,074
never would have dreamt of getting underthe bed to put them on.

1294
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:28,000
At last, he emerged with his hat very muchdented and crushed down over his eyes, and

1295
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,078
began creaking and limping about the room,as if, not being much accustomed to boots,

1296
01:35:32,078 --> 01:35:36,042
his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--

1297
01:35:36,042 --> 01:35:40,097
probably not made to order either--ratherpinched and tormented him at the first go

1298
01:35:40,097 --> 01:35:44,056
off of a bitter cold morning.

1299
01:35:44,056 --> 01:35:48,026
Seeing, now, that there were no curtains tothe window, and that the street being very

1300
01:35:48,026 --> 01:35:53,429
narrow, the house opposite commanded aplain view into the room, and observing

1301
01:35:53,429 --> 01:35:55,088
more and more the indecorous figure that

1302
01:35:55,088 --> 01:36:01,003
Queequeg made, staving about with littleelse but his hat and boots on; I begged him

1303
01:36:01,003 --> 01:36:05,007
as well as I could, to accelerate histoilet somewhat, and particularly to get

1304
01:36:05,007 --> 01:36:08,062
into his pantaloons as soon as possible.

1305
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:11,063
He complied, and then proceeded to washhimself.

1306
01:36:11,063 --> 01:36:15,046
At that time in the morning any Christianwould have washed his face; but Queequeg,

1307
01:36:15,046 --> 01:36:20,022
to my amazement, contented himself withrestricting his ablutions to his chest,

1308
01:36:20,022 --> 01:36:22,000
arms, and hands.

1309
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,053
He then donned his waistcoat, and taking upa piece of hard soap on the wash-stand

1310
01:36:26,053 --> 01:36:31,002
centre table, dipped it into water andcommenced lathering his face.

1311
01:36:31,002 --> 01:36:36,012
I was watching to see where he kept hisrazor, when lo and behold, he takes the

1312
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:42,021
harpoon from the bed corner, slips out thelong wooden stock, unsheathes the head,

1313
01:36:42,021 --> 01:36:44,789
whets it a little on his boot, and striding

1314
01:36:44,789 --> 01:36:49,033
up to the bit of mirror against the wall,begins a vigorous scraping, or rather

1315
01:36:49,033 --> 01:36:54,013
harpooning of his cheeks.Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's

1316
01:36:54,013 --> 01:36:56,599
best cutlery with a vengeance.

1317
01:36:56,599 --> 01:37:00,005
Afterwards I wondered the less at thisoperation when I came to know of what fine

1318
01:37:00,005 --> 01:37:05,289
steel the head of a harpoon is made, andhow exceedingly sharp the long straight

1319
01:37:05,289 --> 01:37:08,003
edges are always kept.

1320
01:37:08,003 --> 01:37:12,076
The rest of his toilet was soon achieved,and he proudly marched out of the room,

1321
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:16,094
wrapped up in his great pilot monkeyjacket, and sporting his harpoon like a

1322
01:37:16,094 --> 01:37:21,031
marshal's baton.

1323
01:37:21,031 --> 01:37:24,729
Chapter 5.Breakfast.

1324
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:29,027
I quickly followed suit, and descendinginto the bar-room accosted the grinning

1325
01:37:29,027 --> 01:37:31,068
landlord very pleasantly.

1326
01:37:31,068 --> 01:37:36,063
I cherished no malice towards him, thoughhe had been skylarking with me not a little

1327
01:37:36,063 --> 01:37:39,039
in the matter of my bedfellow.

1328
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:43,099
However, a good laugh is a mighty goodthing, and rather too scarce a good thing;

1329
01:37:43,099 --> 01:37:44,849
the more's the pity.

1330
01:37:44,849 --> 01:37:50,027
So, if any one man, in his own properperson, afford stuff for a good joke to

1331
01:37:50,027 --> 01:37:55,051
anybody, let him not be backward, but lethim cheerfully allow himself to spend and

1332
01:37:55,051 --> 01:37:57,979
be spent in that way.

1333
01:37:57,979 --> 01:38:02,075
And the man that has anything bountifullylaughable about him, be sure there is more

1334
01:38:02,075 --> 01:38:05,096
in that man than you perhaps think for.

1335
01:38:05,096 --> 01:38:09,049
The bar-room was now full of the boarderswho had been dropping in the night

1336
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:13,049
previous, and whom I had not as yet had agood look at.

1337
01:38:13,049 --> 01:38:18,031
They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates,and second mates, and third mates, and sea

1338
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:23,007
carpenters, and sea coopers, and seablacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship

1339
01:38:23,007 --> 01:38:26,789
keepers; a brown and brawny company, with

1340
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:33,065
bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, allwearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.

1341
01:38:33,065 --> 01:38:37,009
You could pretty plainly tell how long eachone had been ashore.

1342
01:38:37,009 --> 01:38:43,012
This young fellow's healthy cheek is like asun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to

1343
01:38:43,012 --> 01:38:49,099
smell almost as musky; he cannot have beenthree days landed from his Indian voyage.

1344
01:38:49,099 --> 01:38:53,064
That man next him looks a few shadeslighter; you might say a touch of satin

1345
01:38:53,064 --> 01:38:55,021
wood is in him.

1346
01:38:55,021 --> 01:39:00,005
In the complexion of a third still lingersa tropic tawn, but slightly bleached

1347
01:39:00,005 --> 01:39:04,033
withal; HE doubtless has tarried wholeweeks ashore.

1348
01:39:04,033 --> 01:39:09,969
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg?which, barred with various tints, seemed

1349
01:39:09,969 --> 01:39:15,042
like the Andes' western slope, to showforth in one array, contrasting climates,

1350
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:17,095
zone by zone.

1351
01:39:17,095 --> 01:39:22,789
"Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord,flinging open a door, and in we went to

1352
01:39:22,789 --> 01:39:24,007
breakfast.

1353
01:39:24,007 --> 01:39:29,001
They say that men who have seen the world,thereby become quite at ease in manner,

1354
01:39:29,001 --> 01:39:31,015
quite self-possessed in company.

1355
01:39:31,015 --> 01:39:36,051
Not always, though: Ledyard, the great NewEngland traveller, and Mungo Park, the

1356
01:39:36,051 --> 01:39:41,349
Scotch one; of all men, they possessed theleast assurance in the parlor.

1357
01:39:41,349 --> 01:39:47,007
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia ina sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or

1358
01:39:47,007 --> 01:39:52,969
the taking a long solitary walk on an emptystomach, in the negro heart of Africa,

1359
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:55,003
which was the sum of poor Mungo's

1360
01:39:55,003 --> 01:40:00,061
performances--this kind of travel, I say,may not be the very best mode of attaining

1361
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:04,909
a high social polish.Still, for the most part, that sort of

1362
01:40:04,909 --> 01:40:07,074
thing is to be had anywhere.

1363
01:40:07,074 --> 01:40:11,093
These reflections just here are occasionedby the circumstance that after we were all

1364
01:40:11,093 --> 01:40:17,069
seated at the table, and I was preparing tohear some good stories about whaling; to my

1365
01:40:17,069 --> 01:40:23,036
no small surprise, nearly every manmaintained a profound silence.

1366
01:40:23,036 --> 01:40:26,076
And not only that, but they lookedembarrassed.

1367
01:40:26,076 --> 01:40:31,002
Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many ofwhom without the slightest bashfulness had

1368
01:40:31,002 --> 01:40:37,011
boarded great whales on the high seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them

1369
01:40:37,011 --> 01:40:39,055
dead without winking; and yet, here they

1370
01:40:39,055 --> 01:40:45,063
sat at a social breakfast table--all of thesame calling, all of kindred tastes--

1371
01:40:45,063 --> 01:40:49,004
looking round as sheepishly at each otheras though they had never been out of sight

1372
01:40:49,004 --> 01:40:52,062
of some sheepfold among the GreenMountains.

1373
01:40:52,062 --> 01:40:58,529
A curious sight; these bashful bears, thesetimid warrior whalemen!

1374
01:40:58,529 --> 01:41:03,008
But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg satthere among them--at the head of the table,

1375
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:08,092
too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.To be sure I cannot say much for his

1376
01:41:08,092 --> 01:41:10,099
breeding.

1377
01:41:10,099 --> 01:41:13,075
His greatest admirer could not havecordially justified his bringing his

1378
01:41:13,075 --> 01:41:18,969
harpoon into breakfast with him, and usingit there without ceremony; reaching over

1379
01:41:18,969 --> 01:41:21,039
the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy

1380
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:24,719
of many heads, and grappling the beefsteakstowards him.

1381
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:30,031
But THAT was certainly very coolly done byhim, and every one knows that in most

1382
01:41:30,031 --> 01:41:36,001
people's estimation, to do anything coollyis to do it genteelly.

1383
01:41:36,001 --> 01:41:41,006
We will not speak of all Queequeg'speculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee

1384
01:41:41,006 --> 01:41:47,038
and hot rolls, and applied his undividedattention to beefsteaks, done rare.

1385
01:41:47,038 --> 01:41:51,409
Enough, that when breakfast was over hewithdrew like the rest into the public

1386
01:41:51,409 --> 01:41:56,088
room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and wassitting there quietly digesting and smoking

1387
01:41:56,088 --> 01:42:03,014
with his inseparable hat on, when I salliedout for a stroll.

1388
01:42:03,014 --> 01:42:07,061
Chapter 6.The Street.

1389
01:42:07,061 --> 01:42:12,034
If I had been astonished at first catchinga glimpse of so outlandish an individual as

1390
01:42:12,034 --> 01:42:17,469
Queequeg circulating among the politesociety of a civilized town, that

1391
01:42:17,469 --> 01:42:20,002
astonishment soon departed upon taking my

1392
01:42:20,002 --> 01:42:24,001
first daylight stroll through the streetsof New Bedford.

1393
01:42:24,001 --> 01:42:28,067
In thoroughfares nigh the docks, anyconsiderable seaport will frequently offer

1394
01:42:28,067 --> 01:42:32,075
to view the queerest looking nondescriptsfrom foreign parts.

1395
01:42:32,075 --> 01:42:37,002
Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets,Mediterranean mariners will sometimes

1396
01:42:37,002 --> 01:42:39,004
jostle the affrighted ladies.

1397
01:42:39,004 --> 01:42:45,093
Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars andMalays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green,

1398
01:42:45,093 --> 01:42:51,087
live Yankees have often scared the natives.But New Bedford beats all Water Street and

1399
01:42:51,087 --> 01:42:52,069
Wapping.

1400
01:42:52,069 --> 01:42:57,969
In these last-mentioned haunts you see onlysailors; but in New Bedford, actual

1401
01:42:57,969 --> 01:43:04,000
cannibals stand chatting at street corners;savages outright; many of whom yet carry on

1402
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,052
their bones unholy flesh.

1403
01:43:06,052 --> 01:43:09,081
It makes a stranger stare.

1404
01:43:09,081 --> 01:43:15,092
But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs,Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and

1405
01:43:15,092 --> 01:43:20,969
Brighggians, and, besides the wildspecimens of the whaling-craft which

1406
01:43:20,969 --> 01:43:23,599
unheeded reel about the streets, you will

1407
01:43:23,599 --> 01:43:27,839
see other sights still more curious,certainly more comical.

1408
01:43:27,839 --> 01:43:34,159
There weekly arrive in this town scores ofgreen Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all

1409
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:37,014
athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.

1410
01:43:37,014 --> 01:43:42,006
They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;fellows who have felled forests, and now

1411
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:45,062
seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.

1412
01:43:45,062 --> 01:43:49,037
Many are as green as the Green Mountainswhence they came.

1413
01:43:49,037 --> 01:43:53,011
In some things you would think them but afew hours old.

1414
01:43:53,011 --> 01:43:56,015
Look there! that chap strutting round thecorner.

1415
01:43:56,015 --> 01:44:00,076
He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailedcoat, girdled with a sailor-belt and

1416
01:44:00,076 --> 01:44:01,008
sheath-knife.

1417
01:44:01,008 --> 01:44:05,031
Here comes another with a sou'-wester and abombazine cloak.

1418
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:11,099
No town-bred dandy will compare with acountry-bred one--I mean a downright

1419
01:44:11,099 --> 01:44:16,629
bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin

1420
01:44:16,629 --> 01:44:19,068
gloves for fear of tanning his hands.

1421
01:44:19,068 --> 01:44:23,072
Now when a country dandy like this takes itinto his head to make a distinguished

1422
01:44:23,072 --> 01:44:28,086
reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things

1423
01:44:28,086 --> 01:44:31,659
he does upon reaching the seaport.

1424
01:44:31,659 --> 01:44:36,058
In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he ordersbell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to

1425
01:44:36,058 --> 01:44:37,085
his canvas trowsers.

1426
01:44:37,085 --> 01:44:43,074
Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burstthose straps in the first howling gale,

1427
01:44:43,074 --> 01:44:48,086
when thou art driven, straps, buttons, andall, down the throat of the tempest.

1428
01:44:48,086 --> 01:44:53,065
But think not that this famous town hasonly harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins

1429
01:44:53,065 --> 01:44:56,043
to show her visitors.Not at all.

1430
01:44:56,043 --> 01:44:59,039
Still New Bedford is a queer place.

1431
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:04,509
Had it not been for us whalemen, that tractof land would this day perhaps have been in

1432
01:45:04,509 --> 01:45:07,085
as howling condition as the coast ofLabrador.

1433
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:12,072
As it is, parts of her back country areenough to frighten one, they look so bony.

1434
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:17,024
The town itself is perhaps the dearestplace to live in, in all New England.

1435
01:45:17,024 --> 01:45:22,067
It is a land of oil, true enough: but notlike Canaan; a land, also, of corn and

1436
01:45:22,067 --> 01:45:23,052
wine.

1437
01:45:23,052 --> 01:45:27,092
The streets do not run with milk; nor inthe spring-time do they pave them with

1438
01:45:27,092 --> 01:45:29,369
fresh eggs.

1439
01:45:29,369 --> 01:45:34,018
Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in allAmerica will you find more patrician-like

1440
01:45:34,018 --> 01:45:39,002
houses; parks and gardens more opulent,than in New Bedford.

1441
01:45:39,002 --> 01:45:44,058
Whence came they? how planted upon thisonce scraggy scoria of a country?

1442
01:45:44,058 --> 01:45:50,016
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematicalharpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and

1443
01:45:50,016 --> 01:45:51,007
your question will be answered.

1444
01:45:51,007 --> 01:45:57,004
Yes; all these brave houses and flowerygardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific,

1445
01:45:57,004 --> 01:45:58,047
and Indian oceans.

1446
01:45:58,047 --> 01:46:02,082
One and all, they were harpooned anddragged up hither from the bottom of the

1447
01:46:02,082 --> 01:46:06,259
sea.Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like

1448
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:07,089
that?

1449
01:46:07,089 --> 01:46:13,007
In New Bedford, fathers, they say, givewhales for dowers to their daughters, and

1450
01:46:13,007 --> 01:46:16,081
portion off their nieces with a fewporpoises a-piece.

1451
01:46:16,081 --> 01:46:20,097
You must go to New Bedford to see abrilliant wedding; for, they say, they have

1452
01:46:20,097 --> 01:46:25,073
reservoirs of oil in every house, and everynight recklessly burn their lengths in

1453
01:46:25,073 --> 01:46:28,008
spermaceti candles.

1454
01:46:28,008 --> 01:46:34,032
In summer time, the town is sweet to see;full of fine maples--long avenues of green

1455
01:46:34,032 --> 01:46:35,053
and gold.

1456
01:46:35,053 --> 01:46:40,064
And in August, high in air, the beautifuland bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-

1457
01:46:40,064 --> 01:46:46,869
wise, proffer the passer-by their taperingupright cones of congregated blossoms.

1458
01:46:46,869 --> 01:46:52,032
So omnipotent is art; which in many adistrict of New Bedford has superinduced

1459
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:57,091
bright terraces of flowers upon the barrenrefuse rocks thrown aside at creation's

1460
01:46:57,091 --> 01:47:00,008
final day.

1461
01:47:00,008 --> 01:47:04,077
And the women of New Bedford, they bloomlike their own red roses.

1462
01:47:04,077 --> 01:47:10,031
But roses only bloom in summer; whereas thefine carnation of their cheeks is perennial

1463
01:47:10,031 --> 01:47:12,082
as sunlight in the seventh heavens.

1464
01:47:12,082 --> 01:47:19,007
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, yecannot, save in Salem, where they tell me

1465
01:47:19,007 --> 01:47:24,023
the young girls breathe such musk, theirsailor sweethearts smell them miles off

1466
01:47:24,023 --> 01:47:26,007
shore, as though they were drawing nigh the

1467
01:47:26,007 --> 01:47:32,097
odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanicsands.

1468
01:47:32,097 --> 01:47:37,035
Chapter 7.The Chapel.

1469
01:47:37,035 --> 01:47:42,017
In this same New Bedford there stands aWhaleman's Chapel, and few are the moody

1470
01:47:42,017 --> 01:47:47,509
fishermen, shortly bound for the IndianOcean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday

1471
01:47:47,509 --> 01:47:48,089
visit to the spot.

1472
01:47:48,089 --> 01:47:53,056
I am sure that I did not.Returning from my first morning stroll, I

1473
01:47:53,056 --> 01:47:59,046
again sallied out upon this special errand.The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold,

1474
01:47:59,046 --> 01:48:01,094
to driving sleet and mist.

1475
01:48:01,094 --> 01:48:07,005
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of thecloth called bearskin, I fought my way

1476
01:48:07,005 --> 01:48:09,019
against the stubborn storm.

1477
01:48:09,019 --> 01:48:13,999
Entering, I found a small scatteredcongregation of sailors, and sailors' wives

1478
01:48:13,999 --> 01:48:18,015
and widows.A muffled silence reigned, only broken at

1479
01:48:18,015 --> 01:48:20,749
times by the shrieks of the storm.

1480
01:48:20,749 --> 01:48:25,003
Each silent worshipper seemed purposelysitting apart from the other, as if each

1481
01:48:25,003 --> 01:48:28,749
silent grief were insular andincommunicable.

1482
01:48:28,749 --> 01:48:34,005
The chaplain had not yet arrived; and therethese silent islands of men and women sat

1483
01:48:34,005 --> 01:48:39,089
steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets,with black borders, masoned into the wall

1484
01:48:39,089 --> 01:48:42,003
on either side the pulpit.

1485
01:48:42,003 --> 01:48:47,018
Three of them ran something like thefollowing, but I do not pretend to quote:--

1486
01:48:47,018 --> 01:48:53,056
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who,at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard,

1487
01:48:53,056 --> 01:49:00,006
Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,November 1st, 1836.

1488
01:49:00,006 --> 01:49:06,239
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HISSISTER.

1489
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:13,008
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLISELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH

1490
01:49:13,008 --> 01:49:20,043
MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of theboats' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were

1491
01:49:20,043 --> 01:49:23,027
towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-

1492
01:49:23,027 --> 01:49:28,869
shore Ground in the PACIFIC, December 31st,1839.

1493
01:49:28,869 --> 01:49:34,005
THIS MARBLE Is here placed by theirsurviving SHIPMATES.

1494
01:49:34,005 --> 01:49:40,006
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAINEZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of his boat

1495
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:46,071
was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast ofJapan, AUGUST 3d, 1833.

1496
01:49:46,071 --> 01:49:52,066
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HISWIDOW.

1497
01:49:52,066 --> 01:49:57,065
Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazedhat and jacket, I seated myself near the

1498
01:49:57,065 --> 01:50:02,003
door, and turning sideways was surprised tosee Queequeg near me.

1499
01:50:02,003 --> 01:50:06,879
Affected by the solemnity of the scene,there was a wondering gaze of incredulous

1500
01:50:06,879 --> 01:50:09,035
curiosity in his countenance.

1501
01:50:09,035 --> 01:50:14,073
This savage was the only person present whoseemed to notice my entrance; because he

1502
01:50:14,073 --> 01:50:18,509
was the only one who could not read, and,therefore, was not reading those frigid

1503
01:50:18,509 --> 01:50:20,045
inscriptions on the wall.

1504
01:50:20,045 --> 01:50:25,022
Whether any of the relatives of the seamenwhose names appeared there were now among

1505
01:50:25,022 --> 01:50:30,071
the congregation, I knew not; but so manyare the unrecorded accidents in the

1506
01:50:30,071 --> 01:50:32,064
fishery, and so plainly did several women

1507
01:50:32,064 --> 01:50:37,083
present wear the countenance if not thetrappings of some unceasing grief, that I

1508
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:43,004
feel sure that here before me wereassembled those, in whose unhealing hearts

1509
01:50:43,004 --> 01:50:44,989
the sight of those bleak tablets

1510
01:50:44,989 --> 01:50:48,007
sympathetically caused the old wounds tobleed afresh.

1511
01:50:48,007 --> 01:50:55,489
Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath thegreen grass; who standing among flowers can

1512
01:50:55,489 --> 01:51:02,027
say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye knownot the desolation that broods in bosoms

1513
01:51:02,027 --> 01:51:03,072
like these.

1514
01:51:03,072 --> 01:51:08,032
What bitter blanks in those black-borderedmarbles which cover no ashes!

1515
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:11,058
What despair in those immovableinscriptions!

1516
01:51:11,058 --> 01:51:16,078
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelitiesin the lines that seem to gnaw upon all

1517
01:51:16,078 --> 01:51:21,082
Faith, and refuse resurrections to thebeings who have placelessly perished

1518
01:51:21,082 --> 01:51:23,043
without a grave.

1519
01:51:23,043 --> 01:51:29,015
As well might those tablets stand in thecave of Elephanta as here.

1520
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:34,029
In what census of living creatures, thedead of mankind are included; why it is

1521
01:51:34,029 --> 01:51:39,068
that a universal proverb says of them, thatthey tell no tales, though containing more

1522
01:51:39,068 --> 01:51:42,082
secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is

1523
01:51:42,082 --> 01:51:48,035
that to his name who yesterday departed forthe other world, we prefix so significant

1524
01:51:48,035 --> 01:51:53,499
and infidel a word, and yet do not thusentitle him, if he but embarks for the

1525
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:56,079
remotest Indies of this living earth; why

1526
01:51:56,079 --> 01:52:01,008
the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what

1527
01:52:01,008 --> 01:52:07,619
eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who

1528
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:11,259
died sixty round centuries ago; how it is

1529
01:52:11,259 --> 01:52:15,081
that we still refuse to be comforted forthose who we nevertheless maintain are

1530
01:52:15,081 --> 01:52:22,027
dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all theliving so strive to hush all the dead;

1531
01:52:22,027 --> 01:52:28,109
wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in atomb will terrify a whole city.

1532
01:52:28,109 --> 01:52:32,001
All these things are not without theirmeanings.

1533
01:52:32,001 --> 01:52:37,044
But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among thetombs, and even from these dead doubts she

1534
01:52:37,044 --> 01:52:40,065
gathers her most vital hope.

1535
01:52:40,065 --> 01:52:45,019
It needs scarcely to be told, with whatfeelings, on the eve of a Nantucket voyage,

1536
01:52:45,019 --> 01:52:51,067
I regarded those marble tablets, and by themurky light of that darkened, doleful day

1537
01:52:51,067 --> 01:52:55,239
read the fate of the whalemen who had gonebefore me.

1538
01:52:55,239 --> 01:53:01,052
Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.But somehow I grew merry again.

1539
01:53:01,052 --> 01:53:06,083
Delightful inducements to embark, finechance for promotion, it seems--aye, a

1540
01:53:06,083 --> 01:53:10,034
stove boat will make me an immortal bybrevet.

1541
01:53:10,034 --> 01:53:14,093
Yes, there is death in this business ofwhaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic

1542
01:53:14,093 --> 01:53:18,041
bundling of a man into Eternity.But what then?

1543
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:23,009
Methinks we have hugely mistaken thismatter of Life and Death.

1544
01:53:23,009 --> 01:53:27,055
Methinks that what they call my shadow hereon earth is my true substance.

1545
01:53:27,055 --> 01:53:32,069
Methinks that in looking at thingsspiritual, we are too much like oysters

1546
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:37,029
observing the sun through the water, andthinking that thick water the thinnest of

1547
01:53:37,029 --> 01:53:37,047
air.

1548
01:53:37,047 --> 01:53:42,017
Methinks my body is but the lees of mybetter being.

1549
01:53:42,017 --> 01:53:47,359
In fact take my body who will, take it Isay, it is not me.

1550
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:52,989
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket;and come a stove boat and stove body when

1551
01:53:52,989 --> 01:54:03,007
they will, for stave my soul, Jove himselfcannot.

1552
01:54:03,007 --> 01:54:04,007
>

1553
01:54:04,007 --> 01:54:16,074
-Chapter 8.The Pulpit.

1554
01:54:16,074 --> 01:54:22,031
I had not been seated very long ere a manof a certain venerable robustness entered;

1555
01:54:22,031 --> 01:54:27,078
immediately as the storm-pelted door flewback upon admitting him, a quick regardful

1556
01:54:27,078 --> 01:54:30,309
eyeing of him by all the congregation,

1557
01:54:30,309 --> 01:54:34,719
sufficiently attested that this fine oldman was the chaplain.

1558
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:39,064
Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, socalled by the whalemen, among whom he was a

1559
01:54:39,064 --> 01:54:40,939
very great favourite.

1560
01:54:40,939 --> 01:54:46,036
He had been a sailor and a harpooneer inhis youth, but for many years past had

1561
01:54:46,036 --> 01:54:48,098
dedicated his life to the ministry.

1562
01:54:48,098 --> 01:54:53,056
At the time I now write of, Father Mapplewas in the hardy winter of a healthy old

1563
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:59,027
age; that sort of old age which seemsmerging into a second flowering youth, for

1564
01:54:59,027 --> 01:55:01,349
among all the fissures of his wrinkles,

1565
01:55:01,349 --> 01:55:06,088
there shone certain mild gleams of a newlydeveloping bloom--the spring verdure

1566
01:55:06,088 --> 01:55:10,031
peeping forth even beneath February's snow.

1567
01:55:10,031 --> 01:55:15,062
No one having previously heard his history,could for the first time behold Father

1568
01:55:15,062 --> 01:55:20,037
Mapple without the utmost interest, becausethere were certain engrafted clerical

1569
01:55:20,037 --> 01:55:26,009
peculiarities about him, imputable to thatadventurous maritime life he had led.

1570
01:55:26,009 --> 01:55:30,098
When he entered I observed that he carriedno umbrella, and certainly had not come in

1571
01:55:30,098 --> 01:55:35,083
his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat randown with melting sleet, and his great

1572
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:38,004
pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag

1573
01:55:38,004 --> 01:55:42,779
him to the floor with the weight of thewater it had absorbed.

1574
01:55:42,779 --> 01:55:48,044
However, hat and coat and overshoes wereone by one removed, and hung up in a little

1575
01:55:48,044 --> 01:55:53,009
space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayedin a decent suit, he quietly approached the

1576
01:55:53,009 --> 01:55:55,081
pulpit.

1577
01:55:55,081 --> 01:56:01,007
Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was avery lofty one, and since a regular stairs

1578
01:56:01,007 --> 01:56:06,349
to such a height would, by its long anglewith the floor, seriously contract the

1579
01:56:06,349 --> 01:56:09,099
already small area of the chapel, the

1580
01:56:09,099 --> 01:56:13,439
architect, it seemed, had acted upon thehint of Father Mapple, and finished the

1581
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:19,013
pulpit without a stairs, substituting aperpendicular side ladder, like those used

1582
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:22,009
in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.

1583
01:56:22,009 --> 01:56:26,006
The wife of a whaling captain had providedthe chapel with a handsome pair of red

1584
01:56:26,006 --> 01:56:31,075
worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which,being itself nicely headed, and stained

1585
01:56:31,075 --> 01:56:33,064
with a mahogany colour, the whole

1586
01:56:33,064 --> 01:56:38,049
contrivance, considering what manner ofchapel it was, seemed by no means in bad

1587
01:56:38,049 --> 01:56:39,049
taste.

1588
01:56:39,049 --> 01:56:44,035
Halting for an instant at the foot of theladder, and with both hands grasping the

1589
01:56:44,035 --> 01:56:49,092
ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, FatherMapple cast a look upwards, and then with a

1590
01:56:49,092 --> 01:56:52,035
truly sailor-like but still reverential

1591
01:56:52,035 --> 01:56:57,799
dexterity, hand over hand, mounted thesteps as if ascending the main-top of his

1592
01:56:57,799 --> 01:56:59,062
vessel.

1593
01:56:59,062 --> 01:57:03,051
The perpendicular parts of this sideladder, as is usually the case with

1594
01:57:03,051 --> 01:57:08,085
swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope,only the rounds were of wood, so that at

1595
01:57:08,085 --> 01:57:11,028
every step there was a joint.

1596
01:57:11,028 --> 01:57:15,067
At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it hadnot escaped me that however convenient for

1597
01:57:15,067 --> 01:57:20,269
a ship, these joints in the presentinstance seemed unnecessary.

1598
01:57:20,269 --> 01:57:25,045
For I was not prepared to see Father Mappleafter gaining the height, slowly turn

1599
01:57:25,045 --> 01:57:30,019
round, and stooping over the pulpit,deliberately drag up the ladder step by

1600
01:57:30,019 --> 01:57:33,065
step, till the whole was deposited within,

1601
01:57:33,065 --> 01:57:36,064
leaving him impregnable in his littleQuebec.

1602
01:57:36,064 --> 01:57:41,092
I pondered some time without fullycomprehending the reason for this.

1603
01:57:41,092 --> 01:57:46,087
Father Mapple enjoyed such a widereputation for sincerity and sanctity, that

1604
01:57:46,087 --> 01:57:52,299
I could not suspect him of courtingnotoriety by any mere tricks of the stage.

1605
01:57:52,299 --> 01:57:57,038
No, thought I, there must be some soberreason for this thing; furthermore, it must

1606
01:57:57,038 --> 01:58:00,049
symbolize something unseen.

1607
01:58:00,049 --> 01:58:05,046
Can it be, then, that by that act ofphysical isolation, he signifies his

1608
01:58:05,046 --> 01:58:11,049
spiritual withdrawal for the time, from alloutward worldly ties and connexions?

1609
01:58:11,049 --> 01:58:17,189
Yes, for replenished with the meat and wineof the word, to the faithful man of God,

1610
01:58:17,189 --> 01:58:23,499
this pulpit, I see, is a self-containingstronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a

1611
01:58:23,499 --> 01:58:27,035
perennial well of water within the walls.

1612
01:58:27,035 --> 01:58:31,047
But the side ladder was not the onlystrange feature of the place, borrowed from

1613
01:58:31,047 --> 01:58:34,001
the chaplain's former sea-farings.

1614
01:58:34,001 --> 01:58:38,005
Between the marble cenotaphs on either handof the pulpit, the wall which formed its

1615
01:58:38,005 --> 01:58:44,011
back was adorned with a large paintingrepresenting a gallant ship beating against

1616
01:58:44,011 --> 01:58:49,459
a terrible storm off a lee coast of blackrocks and snowy breakers.

1617
01:58:49,459 --> 01:58:54,589
But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle

1618
01:58:54,589 --> 01:58:59,013
of sunlight, from which beamed forth anangel's face; and this bright face shed a

1619
01:58:59,013 --> 01:59:02,005
distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's

1620
01:59:02,005 --> 01:59:07,119
tossed deck, something like that silverplate now inserted into the Victory's plank

1621
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,003
where Nelson fell.

1622
01:59:09,003 --> 01:59:14,048
"Ah, noble ship," the angel seemed to say,"beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and

1623
01:59:14,048 --> 01:59:19,098
bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun isbreaking through; the clouds are rolling

1624
01:59:19,098 --> 01:59:23,063
off--serenest azure is at hand."

1625
01:59:23,063 --> 01:59:27,088
Nor was the pulpit itself without a traceof the same sea-taste that had achieved the

1626
01:59:27,088 --> 01:59:29,078
ladder and the picture.

1627
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:35,029
Its panelled front was in the likeness of aship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible

1628
01:59:35,029 --> 01:59:39,054
rested on a projecting piece of scrollwork, fashioned after a ship's fiddle-

1629
01:59:39,054 --> 01:59:41,001
headed beak.

1630
01:59:41,001 --> 01:59:46,016
What could be more full of meaning?--forthe pulpit is ever this earth's foremost

1631
01:59:46,016 --> 01:59:51,459
part; all the rest comes in its rear; thepulpit leads the world.

1632
01:59:51,459 --> 01:59:56,091
From thence it is the storm of God's quickwrath is first descried, and the bow must

1633
01:59:56,091 --> 01:59:59,002
bear the earliest brunt.

1634
01:59:59,002 --> 02:00:04,051
From thence it is the God of breezes fairor foul is first invoked for favourable

1635
02:00:04,051 --> 02:00:05,619
winds.

1636
02:00:05,619 --> 02:00:11,044
Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out,and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit

1637
02:00:11,044 --> 02:00:14,064
is its prow.

1638
02:00:14,064 --> 02:00:18,032
Chapter 9.The Sermon.

1639
02:00:18,032 --> 02:00:23,044
Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice ofunassuming authority ordered the scattered

1640
02:00:23,044 --> 02:00:27,649
people to condense."Starboard gangway, there! side away to

1641
02:00:27,649 --> 02:00:30,649
larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!

1642
02:00:30,649 --> 02:00:35,081
Midships! midships!"There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots

1643
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:40,082
among the benches, and a still slightershuffling of women's shoes, and all was

1644
02:00:40,082 --> 02:00:44,011
quiet again, and every eye on the preacher.

1645
02:00:44,011 --> 02:00:49,097
He paused a little; then kneeling in thepulpit's bows, folded his large brown hands

1646
02:00:49,097 --> 02:00:55,869
across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes,and offered a prayer so deeply devout that

1647
02:00:55,869 --> 02:00:59,076
he seemed kneeling and praying at thebottom of the sea.

1648
02:00:59,076 --> 02:01:05,044
This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, likethe continual tolling of a bell in a ship

1649
02:01:05,044 --> 02:01:11,049
that is foundering at sea in a fog--in suchtones he commenced reading the following

1650
02:01:11,049 --> 02:01:13,061
hymn; but changing his manner towards the

1651
02:01:13,061 --> 02:01:19,078
concluding stanzas, burst forth with apealing exultation and joy--

1652
02:01:19,078 --> 02:01:23,079
"The ribs and terrors in the whale,Arched over me a dismal gloom,

1653
02:01:23,079 --> 02:01:29,709
While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,And lift me deepening down to doom.

1654
02:01:29,709 --> 02:01:34,089
"I saw the opening maw of hell,With endless pains and sorrows there;

1655
02:01:34,089 --> 02:01:39,149
Which none but they that feel can tell--Oh, I was plunging to despair.

1656
02:01:39,149 --> 02:01:43,769
"In black distress, I called my God,When I could scarce believe him mine,

1657
02:01:43,769 --> 02:01:48,799
He bowed his ear to my complaints--No more the whale did me confine.

1658
02:01:48,799 --> 02:01:53,086
"With speed he flew to my relief,As on a radiant dolphin borne;

1659
02:01:53,086 --> 02:01:58,899
Awful, yet bright, as lightning shoneThe face of my Deliverer God.

1660
02:01:58,899 --> 02:02:03,032
"My song for ever shall recordThat terrible, that joyful hour;

1661
02:02:03,032 --> 02:02:11,369
I give the glory to my God,His all the mercy and the power."

1662
02:02:11,369 --> 02:02:16,022
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn,which swelled high above the howling of the

1663
02:02:16,022 --> 02:02:16,022
storm.

1664
02:02:16,022 --> 02:02:22,007
A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowlyturned over the leaves of the Bible, and at

1665
02:02:22,007 --> 02:02:28,092
last, folding his hand down upon the properpage, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the

1666
02:02:28,092 --> 02:02:32,044
last verse of the first chapter of Jonah--

1667
02:02:32,044 --> 02:02:37,036
'And God had prepared a great fish toswallow up Jonah.'"

1668
02:02:37,036 --> 02:02:42,359
"Shipmates, this book, containing only fourchapters--four yarns--is one of the

1669
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:46,159
smallest strands in the mighty cable of theScriptures.

1670
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:51,599
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah'sdeep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson

1671
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:56,789
to us is this prophet!What a noble thing is that canticle in the

1672
02:02:56,789 --> 02:02:57,099
fish's belly!

1673
02:02:57,099 --> 02:03:03,037
How billow-like and boisterously grand!We feel the floods surging over us; we

1674
02:03:03,037 --> 02:03:08,095
sound with him to the kelpy bottom of thewaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the

1675
02:03:08,095 --> 02:03:10,539
sea is about us!

1676
02:03:10,539 --> 02:03:14,008
But WHAT is this lesson that the book ofJonah teaches?

1677
02:03:14,008 --> 02:03:20,007
Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; alesson to us all as sinful men, and a

1678
02:03:20,007 --> 02:03:23,002
lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.

1679
02:03:23,002 --> 02:03:28,001
As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all,because it is a story of the sin, hard-

1680
02:03:28,001 --> 02:03:33,087
heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, theswift punishment, repentance, prayers, and

1681
02:03:33,087 --> 02:03:37,002
finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.

1682
02:03:37,002 --> 02:03:42,007
As with all sinners among men, the sin ofthis son of Amittai was in his wilful

1683
02:03:42,007 --> 02:03:47,909
disobedience of the command of God--nevermind now what that command was, or how

1684
02:03:47,909 --> 02:03:51,076
conveyed--which he found a hard command.

1685
02:03:51,076 --> 02:03:57,026
But all the things that God would have usdo are hard for us to do--remember that--

1686
02:03:57,026 --> 02:04:02,017
and hence, he oftener commands us thanendeavors to persuade.

1687
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:07,061
And if we obey God, we must disobeyourselves; and it is in this disobeying

1688
02:04:07,061 --> 02:04:12,032
ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeyingGod consists.

1689
02:04:12,032 --> 02:04:17,000
"With this sin of disobedience in him,Jonah still further flouts at God, by

1690
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,011
seeking to flee from Him.

1691
02:04:19,011 --> 02:04:23,055
He thinks that a ship made by men willcarry him into countries where God does not

1692
02:04:23,055 --> 02:04:30,052
reign, but only the Captains of this earth.He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and

1693
02:04:30,052 --> 02:04:33,043
seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.

1694
02:04:33,043 --> 02:04:37,005
There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheededmeaning here.

1695
02:04:37,005 --> 02:04:41,076
By all accounts Tarshish could have been noother city than the modern Cadiz.

1696
02:04:41,076 --> 02:04:44,068
That's the opinion of learned men.

1697
02:04:44,068 --> 02:04:50,229
And where is Cadiz, shipmates?Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from

1698
02:04:50,229 --> 02:04:55,034
Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailedin those ancient days, when the Atlantic

1699
02:04:55,034 --> 02:04:58,039
was an almost unknown sea.

1700
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:02,009
Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates,is on the most easterly coast of the

1701
02:05:02,009 --> 02:05:08,979
Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish orCadiz more than two thousand miles to the

1702
02:05:08,979 --> 02:05:13,061
westward from that, just outside theStraits of Gibraltar.

1703
02:05:13,061 --> 02:05:20,029
See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonahsought to flee world-wide from God?

1704
02:05:20,029 --> 02:05:20,032
Miserable man!

1705
02:05:20,032 --> 02:05:27,062
Oh! most contemptible and worthy of allscorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye,

1706
02:05:27,062 --> 02:05:33,013
skulking from his God; prowling among theshipping like a vile burglar hastening to

1707
02:05:33,013 --> 02:05:35,025
cross the seas.

1708
02:05:35,025 --> 02:05:39,094
So disordered, self-condemning is his look,that had there been policemen in those

1709
02:05:39,094 --> 02:05:44,042
days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion ofsomething wrong, had been arrested ere he

1710
02:05:44,042 --> 02:05:46,006
touched a deck.

1711
02:05:46,006 --> 02:05:53,037
How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage,not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,--no

1712
02:05:53,037 --> 02:05:56,071
friends accompany him to the wharf withtheir adieux.

1713
02:05:56,071 --> 02:06:01,969
At last, after much dodging search, hefinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last

1714
02:06:01,969 --> 02:06:07,075
items of her cargo; and as he steps onboard to see its Captain in the cabin, all

1715
02:06:07,075 --> 02:06:10,024
the sailors for the moment desist from

1716
02:06:10,024 --> 02:06:14,539
hoisting in the goods, to mark thestranger's evil eye.

1717
02:06:14,539 --> 02:06:19,065
Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries tolook all ease and confidence; in vain

1718
02:06:19,065 --> 02:06:22,051
essays his wretched smile.

1719
02:06:22,051 --> 02:06:27,909
Strong intuitions of the man assure themariners he can be no innocent.

1720
02:06:27,909 --> 02:06:32,067
In their gamesome but still serious way,one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's

1721
02:06:32,067 --> 02:06:38,349
robbed a widow;" or, "Joe, do you mark him;he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry lad, I guess

1722
02:06:38,349 --> 02:06:40,659
he's the adulterer that broke jail in old

1723
02:06:40,659 --> 02:06:45,012
Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missingmurderers from Sodom."

1724
02:06:45,012 --> 02:06:49,063
Another runs to read the bill that's stuckagainst the spile upon the wharf to which

1725
02:06:49,063 --> 02:06:54,279
the ship is moored, offering five hundredgold coins for the apprehension of a

1726
02:06:54,279 --> 02:06:58,038
parricide, and containing a description ofhis person.

1727
02:06:58,038 --> 02:07:03,025
He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill;while all his sympathetic shipmates now

1728
02:07:03,025 --> 02:07:06,729
crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay theirhands upon him.

1729
02:07:06,729 --> 02:07:12,038
Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning allhis boldness to his face, only looks so

1730
02:07:12,038 --> 02:07:17,019
much the more a coward.He will not confess himself suspected; but

1731
02:07:17,019 --> 02:07:19,979
that itself is strong suspicion.

1732
02:07:19,979 --> 02:07:24,038
So he makes the best of it; and when thesailors find him not to be the man that is

1733
02:07:24,038 --> 02:07:29,029
advertised, they let him pass, and hedescends into the cabin.

1734
02:07:29,029 --> 02:07:33,049
"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at hisbusy desk, hurriedly making out his papers

1735
02:07:33,049 --> 02:07:38,729
for the Customs--'Who's there?'Oh! how that harmless question mangles

1736
02:07:38,729 --> 02:07:39,969
Jonah!

1737
02:07:39,969 --> 02:07:43,024
For the instant he almost turns to fleeagain.

1738
02:07:43,024 --> 02:07:47,092
But he rallies.'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;

1739
02:07:47,092 --> 02:07:50,043
how soon sail ye, sir?'

1740
02:07:50,043 --> 02:07:55,087
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked upto Jonah, though the man now stands before

1741
02:07:55,087 --> 02:08:02,002
him; but no sooner does he hear that hollowvoice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.

1742
02:08:02,002 --> 02:08:08,026
'We sail with the next coming tide,' atlast he slowly answered, still intently

1743
02:08:08,026 --> 02:08:12,096
eyeing him.'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any

1744
02:08:12,096 --> 02:08:15,046
honest man that goes a passenger.'

1745
02:08:15,046 --> 02:08:20,979
Ha! Jonah, that's another stab.But he swiftly calls away the Captain from

1746
02:08:20,979 --> 02:08:22,001
that scent.

1747
02:08:22,001 --> 02:08:26,061
'I'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'thepassage money how much is that?--I'll pay

1748
02:08:26,061 --> 02:08:27,083
now.'

1749
02:08:27,083 --> 02:08:32,067
For it is particularly written, shipmates,as if it were a thing not to be overlooked

1750
02:08:32,067 --> 02:08:37,095
in this history, 'that he paid the farethereof' ere the craft did sail.

1751
02:08:37,095 --> 02:08:42,008
And taken with the context, this is full ofmeaning.

1752
02:08:42,008 --> 02:08:48,007
"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was onewhose discernment detects crime in any, but

1753
02:08:48,007 --> 02:08:52,005
whose cupidity exposes it only in thepenniless.

1754
02:08:52,005 --> 02:08:57,729
In this world, shipmates, sin that pays itsway can travel freely, and without a

1755
02:08:57,729 --> 02:09:02,839
passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, isstopped at all frontiers.

1756
02:09:02,839 --> 02:09:07,094
So Jonah's Captain prepares to test thelength of Jonah's purse, ere he judge him

1757
02:09:07,094 --> 02:09:12,469
openly.He charges him thrice the usual sum; and

1758
02:09:12,469 --> 02:09:13,339
it's assented to.

1759
02:09:13,339 --> 02:09:19,036
Then the Captain knows that Jonah is afugitive; but at the same time resolves to

1760
02:09:19,036 --> 02:09:23,000
help a flight that paves its rear withgold.

1761
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,002
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,prudent suspicions still molest the

1762
02:09:28,002 --> 02:09:32,064
Captain.He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.

1763
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:37,789
Not a forger, any way, he mutters; andJonah is put down for his passage.

1764
02:09:37,789 --> 02:09:42,076
'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonahnow, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'

1765
02:09:42,076 --> 02:09:47,018
'Thou lookest like it,' says the Captain,'there's thy room.'

1766
02:09:47,018 --> 02:09:51,789
Jonah enters, and would lock the door, butthe lock contains no key.

1767
02:09:51,789 --> 02:09:56,789
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, theCaptain laughs lowly to himself, and

1768
02:09:56,789 --> 02:10:00,979
mutters something about the doors ofconvicts' cells being never allowed to be

1769
02:10:00,979 --> 02:10:02,076
locked within.

1770
02:10:02,076 --> 02:10:07,839
All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonahthrows himself into his berth, and finds

1771
02:10:07,839 --> 02:10:11,008
the little state-room ceiling almostresting on his forehead.

1772
02:10:11,008 --> 02:10:14,062
The air is close, and Jonah gasps.

1773
02:10:14,062 --> 02:10:20,063
Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah feels

1774
02:10:20,063 --> 02:10:26,005
the heralding presentiment of that stiflinghour, when the whale shall hold him in the

1775
02:10:26,005 --> 02:10:30,014
smallest of his bowels' wards.

1776
02:10:30,014 --> 02:10:34,789
"Screwed at its axis against the side, aswinging lamp slightly oscillates in

1777
02:10:34,789 --> 02:10:40,008
Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling overtowards the wharf with the weight of the

1778
02:10:40,008 --> 02:10:43,017
last bales received, the lamp, flame and

1779
02:10:43,017 --> 02:10:48,349
all, though in slight motion, stillmaintains a permanent obliquity with

1780
02:10:48,349 --> 02:10:54,159
reference to the room; though, in truth,infallibly straight itself, it but made

1781
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:58,959
obvious the false, lying levels among whichit hung.

1782
02:10:58,959 --> 02:11:04,052
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; aslying in his berth his tormented eyes roll

1783
02:11:04,052 --> 02:11:10,349
round the place, and this thus farsuccessful fugitive finds no refuge for his

1784
02:11:10,349 --> 02:11:12,007
restless glance.

1785
02:11:12,007 --> 02:11:16,022
But that contradiction in the lamp more andmore appals him.

1786
02:11:16,022 --> 02:11:19,096
The floor, the ceiling, and the side, areall awry.

1787
02:11:19,096 --> 02:11:26,029
'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' hegroans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but

1788
02:11:26,029 --> 02:11:30,095
the chambers of my soul are all incrookedness!'

1789
02:11:30,095 --> 02:11:36,003
"Like one who after a night of drunkenrevelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but

1790
02:11:36,003 --> 02:11:40,093
with conscience yet pricking him, as theplungings of the Roman race-horse but so

1791
02:11:40,093 --> 02:11:43,041
much the more strike his steel tags into

1792
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:49,014
him; as one who in that miserable plightstill turns and turns in giddy anguish,

1793
02:11:49,014 --> 02:11:55,055
praying God for annihilation until the fitbe passed; and at last amid the whirl of

1794
02:11:55,055 --> 02:11:58,059
woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over

1795
02:11:58,059 --> 02:12:03,077
him, as over the man who bleeds to death,for conscience is the wound, and there's

1796
02:12:03,077 --> 02:12:09,006
naught to staunch it; so, after sorewrestlings in his berth, Jonah's prodigy of

1797
02:12:09,006 --> 02:12:14,053
ponderous misery drags him drowning down tosleep.

1798
02:12:14,053 --> 02:12:19,082
"And now the time of tide has come; theship casts off her cables; and from the

1799
02:12:19,082 --> 02:12:25,086
deserted wharf the uncheered ship forTarshish, all careening, glides to sea.

1800
02:12:25,086 --> 02:12:30,064
That ship, my friends, was the first ofrecorded smugglers! the contraband was

1801
02:12:30,064 --> 02:12:34,061
Jonah.But the sea rebels; he will not bear the

1802
02:12:34,061 --> 02:12:35,092
wicked burden.

1803
02:12:35,092 --> 02:12:40,018
A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is liketo break.

1804
02:12:40,018 --> 02:12:45,041
But now when the boatswain calls all handsto lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars

1805
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:50,008
are clattering overboard; when the wind isshrieking, and the men are yelling, and

1806
02:12:50,008 --> 02:12:52,046
every plank thunders with trampling feet

1807
02:12:52,046 --> 02:12:59,003
right over Jonah's head; in all this ragingtumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.

1808
02:12:59,003 --> 02:13:05,002
He sees no black sky and raging sea, feelsnot the reeling timbers, and little hears

1809
02:13:05,002 --> 02:13:10,078
he or heeds he the far rush of the mightywhale, which even now with open mouth is

1810
02:13:10,078 --> 02:13:12,072
cleaving the seas after him.

1811
02:13:12,072 --> 02:13:19,031
Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down intothe sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin

1812
02:13:19,031 --> 02:13:22,006
as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.

1813
02:13:22,006 --> 02:13:27,019
But the frightened master comes to him, andshrieks in his dead ear, 'What meanest

1814
02:13:27,019 --> 02:13:29,086
thou, O, sleeper! arise!'

1815
02:13:29,086 --> 02:13:35,042
Startled from his lethargy by that direfulcry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and

1816
02:13:35,042 --> 02:13:39,999
stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, tolook out upon the sea.

1817
02:13:39,999 --> 02:13:45,058
But at that moment he is sprung upon by apanther billow leaping over the bulwarks.

1818
02:13:45,058 --> 02:13:51,119
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,and finding no speedy vent runs roaring

1819
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:56,027
fore and aft, till the mariners come nighto drowning while yet afloat.

1820
02:13:56,027 --> 02:14:00,068
And ever, as the white moon shows heraffrighted face from the steep gullies in

1821
02:14:00,068 --> 02:14:06,083
the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah seesthe rearing bowsprit pointing high upward,

1822
02:14:06,083 --> 02:14:11,004
but soon beat downward again towards thetormented deep.

1823
02:14:11,004 --> 02:14:14,059
"Terrors upon terrors run shouting throughhis soul.

1824
02:14:14,059 --> 02:14:19,077
In all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.

1825
02:14:19,077 --> 02:14:24,058
The sailors mark him; more and more certaingrow their suspicions of him, and at last,

1826
02:14:24,058 --> 02:14:29,021
fully to test the truth, by referring thewhole matter to high Heaven, they fall to

1827
02:14:29,021 --> 02:14:34,489
casting lots, to see for whose cause thisgreat tempest was upon them.

1828
02:14:34,489 --> 02:14:39,259
The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, thenhow furiously they mob him with their

1829
02:14:39,259 --> 02:14:40,006
questions.

1830
02:14:40,006 --> 02:14:43,056
'What is thine occupation?Whence comest thou?

1831
02:14:43,056 --> 02:14:46,031
Thy country?What people?

1832
02:14:46,031 --> 02:14:50,006
But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior ofpoor Jonah.

1833
02:14:50,006 --> 02:14:54,047
The eager mariners but ask him who he is,and where from; whereas, they not only

1834
02:14:54,047 --> 02:14:58,081
receive an answer to those questions, butlikewise another answer to a question not

1835
02:14:58,081 --> 02:15:01,007
put by them, but the unsolicited answer is

1836
02:15:01,007 --> 02:15:06,109
forced from Jonah by the hard hand of Godthat is upon him.

1837
02:15:06,109 --> 02:15:10,092
"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'Ifear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath

1838
02:15:10,092 --> 02:15:13,028
made the sea and the dry land!'

1839
02:15:13,028 --> 02:15:18,006
Fear him, O Jonah?Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God

1840
02:15:18,006 --> 02:15:18,094
THEN!

1841
02:15:18,094 --> 02:15:24,003
Straightway, he now goes on to make a fullconfession; whereupon the mariners became

1842
02:15:24,003 --> 02:15:27,032
more and more appalled, but still arepitiful.

1843
02:15:27,032 --> 02:15:32,094
For when Jonah, not yet supplicating Godfor mercy, since he but too well knew the

1844
02:15:32,094 --> 02:15:37,489
darkness of his deserts,--when wretchedJonah cries out to them to take him and

1845
02:15:37,489 --> 02:15:40,239
cast him forth into the sea, for he knew

1846
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:45,083
that for HIS sake this great tempest wasupon them; they mercifully turn from him,

1847
02:15:45,083 --> 02:15:48,859
and seek by other means to save the ship.

1848
02:15:48,859 --> 02:15:54,067
But all in vain; the indignant gale howlslouder; then, with one hand raised

1849
02:15:54,067 --> 02:16:01,043
invokingly to God, with the other they notunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

1850
02:16:01,043 --> 02:16:06,083
"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchorand dropped into the sea; when instantly an

1851
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:12,039
oily calmness floats out from the east, andthe sea is still, as Jonah carries down the

1852
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:15,004
gale with him, leaving smooth water behind.

1853
02:16:15,004 --> 02:16:21,629
He goes down in the whirling heart of sucha masterless commotion that he scarce heeds

1854
02:16:21,629 --> 02:16:26,089
the moment when he drops seething into theyawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale

1855
02:16:26,089 --> 02:16:32,065
shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so manywhite bolts, upon his prison.

1856
02:16:32,065 --> 02:16:36,054
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of thefish's belly.

1857
02:16:36,054 --> 02:16:40,044
But observe his prayer, and learn a weightylesson.

1858
02:16:40,044 --> 02:16:45,071
For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weepand wail for direct deliverance.

1859
02:16:45,071 --> 02:16:48,092
He feels that his dreadful punishment isjust.

1860
02:16:48,092 --> 02:16:53,079
He leaves all his deliverance to God,contenting himself with this, that spite of

1861
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:58,067
all his pains and pangs, he will still looktowards His holy temple.

1862
02:16:58,067 --> 02:17:04,629
And here, shipmates, is true and faithfulrepentance; not clamorous for pardon, but

1863
02:17:04,629 --> 02:17:06,879
grateful for punishment.

1864
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:12,039
And how pleasing to God was this conduct inJonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance

1865
02:17:12,039 --> 02:17:14,093
of him from the sea and the whale.

1866
02:17:14,093 --> 02:17:20,082
Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before youto be copied for his sin but I do place him

1867
02:17:20,082 --> 02:17:27,014
before you as a model for repentance.Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent

1868
02:17:27,014 --> 02:17:30,081
of it like Jonah."

1869
02:17:30,081 --> 02:17:34,084
While he was speaking these words, thehowling of the shrieking, slanting storm

1870
02:17:34,084 --> 02:17:40,029
without seemed to add new power to thepreacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea-

1871
02:17:40,029 --> 02:17:42,989
storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.

1872
02:17:42,989 --> 02:17:47,999
His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring

1873
02:17:47,999 --> 02:17:53,031
elements at work; and the thunders thatrolled away from off his swarthy brow, and

1874
02:17:53,031 --> 02:17:55,052
the light leaping from his eye, made all

1875
02:17:55,052 --> 02:18:00,083
his simple hearers look on him with a quickfear that was strange to them.

1876
02:18:00,083 --> 02:18:04,096
There now came a lull in his look, as hesilently turned over the leaves of the Book

1877
02:18:04,096 --> 02:18:10,065
once more; and, at last, standingmotionless, with closed eyes, for the

1878
02:18:10,065 --> 02:18:13,759
moment, seemed communing with God andhimself.

1879
02:18:13,759 --> 02:18:17,097
But again he leaned over towards thepeople, and bowing his head lowly, with an

1880
02:18:17,097 --> 02:18:24,053
aspect of the deepest yet manliesthumility, he spake these words:

1881
02:18:24,053 --> 02:18:31,005
"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand uponyou; both his hands press upon me.

1882
02:18:31,005 --> 02:18:36,079
I have read ye by what murky light may bemine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all

1883
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:42,009
sinners; and therefore to ye, and stillmore to me, for I am a greater sinner than

1884
02:18:42,009 --> 02:18:43,081
ye.

1885
02:18:43,081 --> 02:18:48,056
And now how gladly would I come down fromthis mast-head and sit on the hatches there

1886
02:18:48,056 --> 02:18:54,359
where you sit, and listen as you listen,while some one of you reads ME that other

1887
02:18:54,359 --> 02:19:00,369
and more awful lesson which Jonah teachesto ME, as a pilot of the living God.

1888
02:19:00,369 --> 02:19:05,053
How being an anointed pilot-prophet, orspeaker of true things, and bidden by the

1889
02:19:05,053 --> 02:19:11,979
Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in theears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled

1890
02:19:11,979 --> 02:19:14,489
at the hostility he should raise, fled from

1891
02:19:14,489 --> 02:19:20,039
his mission, and sought to escape his dutyand his God by taking ship at Joppa.

1892
02:19:20,039 --> 02:19:24,047
But God is everywhere; Tarshish he neverreached.

1893
02:19:24,047 --> 02:19:29,021
As we have seen, God came upon him in thewhale, and swallowed him down to living

1894
02:19:29,021 --> 02:19:35,068
gulfs of doom, and with swift slantingstore him along 'into the midst of the

1895
02:19:35,068 --> 02:19:38,009
seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him

1896
02:19:38,009 --> 02:19:43,047
ten thousand fathoms down, and 'the weedswere wrapped about his head,' and all the

1897
02:19:43,047 --> 02:19:47,021
watery world of woe bowled over him.

1898
02:19:47,021 --> 02:19:52,003
Yet even then beyond the reach of anyplummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when

1899
02:19:52,003 --> 02:19:58,001
the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmostbones, even then, God heard the engulphed,

1900
02:19:58,001 --> 02:20:00,069
repenting prophet when he cried.

1901
02:20:00,069 --> 02:20:05,096
Then God spake unto the fish; and from theshuddering cold and blackness of the sea,

1902
02:20:05,096 --> 02:20:11,109
the whale came breeching up towards thewarm and pleasant sun, and all the delights

1903
02:20:11,109 --> 02:20:14,014
of air and earth; and 'vomited out Jonah

1904
02:20:14,014 --> 02:20:20,082
upon the dry land;' when the word of theLord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised

1905
02:20:20,082 --> 02:20:26,093
and beaten--his ears, like two sea-shells,still multitudinously murmuring of the

1906
02:20:26,093 --> 02:20:30,014
ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.

1907
02:20:30,014 --> 02:20:34,034
And what was that, shipmates?To preach the Truth to the face of

1908
02:20:34,034 --> 02:20:37,109
Falsehood!That was it!

1909
02:20:37,109 --> 02:20:41,092
"This, shipmates, this is that otherlesson; and woe to that pilot of the living

1910
02:20:41,092 --> 02:20:46,249
God who slights it.Woe to him whom this world charms from

1911
02:20:46,249 --> 02:20:47,052
Gospel duty!

1912
02:20:47,052 --> 02:20:52,509
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon thewaters when God has brewed them into a

1913
02:20:52,509 --> 02:20:56,046
gale!Woe to him who seeks to please rather than

1914
02:20:56,046 --> 02:20:57,089
to appal!

1915
02:20:57,089 --> 02:21:01,999
Woe to him whose good name is more to himthan goodness!

1916
02:21:01,999 --> 02:21:06,001
Woe to him who, in this world, courts notdishonour!

1917
02:21:06,001 --> 02:21:12,609
Woe to him who would not be true, eventhough to be false were salvation!

1918
02:21:12,609 --> 02:21:18,499
Yea, woe to him who, as the great PilotPaul has it, while preaching to others is

1919
02:21:18,499 --> 02:21:23,016
himself a castaway!"

1920
02:21:23,016 --> 02:21:27,239
He dropped and fell away from himself for amoment; then lifting his face to them

1921
02:21:27,239 --> 02:21:32,068
again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as hecried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But

1922
02:21:32,068 --> 02:21:36,056
oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of

1923
02:21:36,056 --> 02:21:41,879
every woe, there is a sure delight; andhigher the top of that delight, than the

1924
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:46,109
bottom of the woe is deep.Is not the main-truck higher than the

1925
02:21:46,109 --> 02:21:48,099
kelson is low?

1926
02:21:48,099 --> 02:21:54,016
Delight is to him--a far, far upward, andinward delight--who against the proud gods

1927
02:21:54,016 --> 02:22:00,004
and commodores of this earth, ever standsforth his own inexorable self.

1928
02:22:00,004 --> 02:22:05,009
Delight is to him whose strong arms yetsupport him, when the ship of this base

1929
02:22:05,009 --> 02:22:08,066
treacherous world has gone down beneathhim.

1930
02:22:08,066 --> 02:22:13,089
Delight is to him, who gives no quarter inthe truth, and kills, burns, and destroys

1931
02:22:13,089 --> 02:22:18,078
all sin though he pluck it out from underthe robes of Senators and Judges.

1932
02:22:18,078 --> 02:22:24,056
Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him,who acknowledges no law or lord, but the

1933
02:22:24,056 --> 02:22:28,066
Lord his God, and is only a patriot toheaven.

1934
02:22:28,066 --> 02:22:34,003
Delight is to him, whom all the waves ofthe billows of the seas of the boisterous

1935
02:22:34,003 --> 02:22:38,032
mob can never shake from this sure Keel ofthe Ages.

1936
02:22:38,032 --> 02:22:44,021
And eternal delight and deliciousness willbe his, who coming to lay him down, can say

1937
02:22:44,021 --> 02:22:51,022
with his final breath--O Father!--chieflyknown to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal,

1938
02:22:51,022 --> 02:22:52,879
here I die.

1939
02:22:52,879 --> 02:22:57,759
I have striven to be Thine, more than to bethis world's, or mine own.

1940
02:22:57,759 --> 02:23:03,359
Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity toThee; for what is man that he should live

1941
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:07,093
out the lifetime of his God?"

1942
02:23:07,093 --> 02:23:12,059
He said no more, but slowly waving abenediction, covered his face with his

1943
02:23:12,059 --> 02:23:18,029
hands, and so remained kneeling, till allthe people had departed, and he was left

1944
02:23:18,029 --> 02:23:23,007
alone in the place.

1945
02:23:23,007 --> 99:59:59,999

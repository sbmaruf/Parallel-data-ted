1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,000
"Google began as a research project in 1996."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,400
"This is a look at how search has evolved."

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,734
Gomes: Our goal is actually to make improvements to Search

4
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:15,167
that just answer the user's information need.

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:18,133
Get them to their answer faster and faster.

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:21,234
So that there's almost a seamless connection between

7
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:23,467
their thoughts and their information needs

8
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:30,868
and the search results that they find.

9
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,200
Singhal: Well, Google was started based upon algorithms

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,167
that Larry and Sergey developed in Stanford

11
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,067
called the PageRank algorithm.

12
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:42,100
And they used that algorithm to indeed build

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,667
a very novel way of searching the web.

14
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,667
Gomes: What was happening at that point was

15
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,701
there was this huge explosion of content in the web,

16
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,434
a bigger explosion of information

17
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:51,834
than had ever happened before.

18
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:54,100
And it was getting increasingly hard to find

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,434
the piece of content you wanted.

20
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,868
"Adwords"

21
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:59,100
Mayer: In the beginning,

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,767
we didn't have any advertisements at all.

23
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,934
And as we went to add advertisements,

24
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:05,400
it was very important to us that those ads be as relevant

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,934
to the search as the search results themselves.

26
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,968
It was also very important to us that they be distinguished

27
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,701
from the search results.

28
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,334
Gomes: There was a clear separation between ads

29
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,267
and Search from the very earliest times.

30
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,868
Search had one goal and one goal alone,

31
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:21,601
to provide the most relevant information for the user

32
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,601
in the fastest time possible.

33
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,100
"Universal Results"

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,501
Mayer: In 1999 and 2000, we had a search engine

35
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,634
that worked wonderfully,

36
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:29,968
and it worked wonderfully for web pages.

37
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,267
One of the things we saw was,

38
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,734
as Google got better and better,

39
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,567
users expected more and more from it.

40
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,734
They didn't want just web pages.

41
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:39,200
They wanted the best possible information available,

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,934
be that a picture or a book.

43
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,200
And so we started looking at how we could search new

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,601
and other forms of content.

45
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,200
And Image Search was the first of those

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,267
because we know that a picture is worth 1,000 words,

47
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,033
and there were a lot of times when people would say,

48
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,767
you know, what is turquoise?

49
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,834
You know, we got a search, "what is turquoise?"

50
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,400
And there's no way to answer that question

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,834
without a picture.

52
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,601
Singhal: When September 11th happened,

53
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,234
we as Google were failing our users.

54
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:09,234
Our users were searching for "New York Twin Towers,"

55
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:12,334
and our results had nothing relevant,

56
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:15,133
nothing related to the sad events of the day

57
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,801
because our index was crawled a month earlier,

58
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:22,100
and, of course, there was no news in that index.

59
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,000
So we placed links to all the news organizations like CNN

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,767
right on our front page saying please visit those sites

61
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,100
to get the news of the day,

62
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,934
because our search is failing you.

63
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,801
My friend Krishna and I were attending a conference

64
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:41,767
at the time, and Krishna started thinking about the problem,

65
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,234
saying, "If we could crawl news quickly,

66
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:47,334
"and we can provide multiple points of view

67
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,234
"about the same story to our users,

68
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,868
wouldn't it be amazing?"

69
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,934
That was the birth of Google News

70
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:57,033
specialized search service.

71
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,133
Mayer: Well, in 2002, one of the trends we started to see

72
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,100
was that the web had become a lot more rich.

73
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,334
More images, more video, different kinds of content.

74
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,934
And we started to realize that our users expected Google

75
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,133
to be able to find something if it existed on the web.

76
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:13,234
They didn't care if it was text or a web page or news,

77
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,200
they wanted it all in one place.

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,701
And so we came up with this notion of Universal Search,

79
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,434
the idea that you could just go to Google,

80
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,267
and no matter what type of content it was,

81
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,033
we could find it.

82
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,400
One of the challenges that came up in Universal Search is that

83
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,534
we were really comparing apples and oranges.

84
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:29,801
Singhal: You can imagine these apples are web pages,

85
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,067
and you can imagine an orange would be an image.

86
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,534
When we look at ranking images,

87
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:39,000
we know what the aspect ratio of an image is,

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,400
how big is the image, how many pixels this image is.

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,734
Is it a black and white image or a color image?

90
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:50,167
And all these signals are only relevant to images,

91
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:52,834
but are not relevant to web pages.

92
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:56,534
And that's why Universal Search was such a hard task

93
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,801
when we did it, because the science was not fully developed.

94
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,767
Mayer: We basically ended up putting things

95
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,868
either on the top of the page, on the bottom of the page,

96
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,367
or somewhere in the middle

97
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,200
because we didn't have a finer-grained way

98
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,434
of looking at the relevance,

99
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,434
especially across different media types.

100
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,434
Singhal: And over the years,

101
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,767
we developed our science tremendously,

102
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,033
and today we are beginning to place

103
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,767
several kinds of information in multiple positions

104
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,300
on our result page

105
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,968
as our algorithms get better and better.

"Quick Answers"

107
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,734
Gomes: Our goal is to make it so that the improvement we make

108
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,434
is so much what you wanted

109
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,434
and fits so cleanly into the flow

110
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,334
of what you are looking for

111
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:36,167
that you almost don't notice that it's happened.

112
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,934
And looking back at it, it seems obvious that that's the way

113
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,934
it should have always been in the first place.

114
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,767
Menzel: When you do need a specific bit of information,

115
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,267
Google tries to provide you exactly that

116
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,534
using our Quick Answers.

117
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,400
For example, take sport scores.

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
You kind of want to know what the score is right now.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,534
You want to know how tall is the Empire State Building?

120
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:58,067
Wright: We want users to come to Google

121
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,400
and get their information as quickly as they possibly can.

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,701
And with Instant, you don't even have to type in

123
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:03,901
your full thought.

124
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,100
You don't have to hit enter.

125
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,501
You can type in something like, "bike h,"

126
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,300
and we'll just show you the results right there

127
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
before you've even finished your thoughts.

"The Future of Search"

129
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,434
Menzel: We are pushing the boundaries

130
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,767
of how you actually fundamentally interact

131
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,200
with the search engine itself.

132
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,501
With Search by Image, you can actually use that image

133
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,801
as an input for the search.

134
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,133
Singhal: The truth is that our users need

135
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,868
much more complex answers.

136
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:34,167
My dream has always been to build the "Star Trek" computer.

137
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,868
And in my ideal world,

138
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:40,868
I would be able to walk up to a computer and say,

139
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:46,234
"Hey, what is the best time for me to sow seeds in India,

140
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,868
given that monsoon was early this year?"

141
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:51,667
And once we can answer that question,

142
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,334
which we don't today,

143
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,968
people will be looking for answers

144
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,133
to even more complex questions.

145
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,868
These are all genuine information needs.

146
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:03,868
Genuine questions that, if we, Google, can answer,

147
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:06,801
our users would become more knowledgeable,

148
00:06:06,801 --> 99:59:59,999
and they would be more satisfied in their quest for knowledge.

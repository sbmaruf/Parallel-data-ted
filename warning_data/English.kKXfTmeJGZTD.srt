00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
CHAPTER 1 LEAVE IT TO JEEVES

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:15,980
Jeeves--my man, you know--is really a most extraordinary chap.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,510
So capable. Honestly, I shouldn't know what to do

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,159
without him.

5
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:27,680
On broader lines he's like those chappies who sit peering sadly over the marble

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,510
battlements at the Pennsylvania Station in the place marked "Inquiries."

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,800
You know the Johnnies I mean.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,589
You go up to them and say: "When's the next train for Melonsquashville, Tennessee?" and

9
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:46,359
they reply, without stopping to think, "Two-forty-three, track ten, change at San

10
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,940
Francisco."

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,310
And they're right every time. Well, Jeeves gives you just the same

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,479
impression of omniscience.

13
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,229
As an instance of what I mean, I remember meeting Monty Byng in Bond Street one

14
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,580
morning, looking the last word in a grey check suit, and I felt I should never be

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,350
happy till I had one like it.

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,660
I dug the address of the tailors out of him, and had them working on the thing

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,930
inside the hour. "Jeeves," I said that evening.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,810
"I'm getting a check suit like that one of Mr. Byng's."

19
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,730
"Injudicious, sir," he said firmly. "It will not become you."

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,450
"What absolute rot!

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,860
It's the soundest thing I've struck for years."

22
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,940
"Unsuitable for you, sir."

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, the long and the short of it was that the confounded thing came home, and I put

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,950
it on, and when I caught sight of myself in the glass I nearly swooned.

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,490
Jeeves was perfectly right.

26
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,720
I looked a cross between a music-hall comedian and a cheap bookie.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,880
Yet Monty had looked fine in absolutely the same stuff.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,180
These things are just Life's mysteries, and that's all there is to it.

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,890
But it isn't only that Jeeves's judgment about clothes is infallible, though, of

30
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,470
course, that's really the main thing.

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,670
The man knows everything. There was the matter of that tip on the

32
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,860
"Lincolnshire." I forget now how I got it, but it had the

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,500
aspect of being the real, red-hot tabasco.

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,830
"Jeeves," I said, for I'm fond of the man, and like to do him a good turn when I can,

35
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,410
"if you want to make a bit of money have something on Wonderchild for the

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,300
'Lincolnshire.'"

37
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,690
He shook his head. "I'd rather not, sir."

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,200
"But it's the straight goods. I'm going to put my shirt on him."

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,880
"I do not recommend it, sir.

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,510
The animal is not intended to win. Second place is what the stable is after."

41
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,650
Perfect piffle, I thought, of course. How the deuce could Jeeves know anything

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,990
about it?

43
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,450
Still, you know what happened. Wonderchild led till he was breathing on

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,230
the wire, and then Banana Fritter came along and nosed him out.

45
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,119
I went straight home and rang for Jeeves.

46
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:15,810
"After this," I said, "not another step for me without your advice.

47
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,060
From now on consider yourself the brains of the establishment."

48
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,280
"Very good, sir.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,470
I shall endeavour to give satisfaction." And he has, by Jove!

50
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm a bit short on brain myself; the old bean would appear to have been constructed

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,980
more for ornament than for use, don't you know; but give me five minutes to talk the

52
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,830
thing over with Jeeves, and I'm game to advise any one about anything.

53
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,730
And that's why, when Bruce Corcoran came to me with his troubles, my first act was to

54
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,570
ring the bell and put it up to the lad with the bulging forehead.

55
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,860
"Leave it to Jeeves," I said.

56
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,340
I first got to know Corky when I came to New York.

57
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,380
He was a pal of my cousin Gussie, who was in with a lot of people down Washington

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,580
Square way.

59
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,660
I don't know if I ever told you about it, but the reason why I left England was

60
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,480
because I was sent over by my Aunt Agatha to try to stop young Gussie marrying a girl

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,869
on the vaudeville stage, and I got the

62
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:20,829
whole thing so mixed up that I decided that it would be a sound scheme for me to stop

63
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,880
on in America for a bit instead of going back and having long cosy chats about the

64
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,469
thing with aunt.

65
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:32,170
So I sent Jeeves out to find a decent apartment, and settled down for a bit of

66
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,179
exile. I'm bound to say that New York's a topping

67
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,100
place to be exiled in.

68
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,260
Everybody was awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty of things going on, and

69
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,420
I'm a wealthy bird, so everything was fine.

70
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,600
Chappies introduced me to other chappies, and so on and so forth, and it wasn't long

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,519
before I knew squads of the right sort, some who rolled in dollars in houses up by

72
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,100
the Park, and others who lived with the gas

73
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,549
turned down mostly around Washington Square--artists and writers and so forth.

74
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:08,579
Brainy coves. Corky was one of the artists.

75
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,709
A portrait-painter, he called himself, but he hadn't painted any portraits.

76
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,739
He was sitting on the side-lines with a blanket over his shoulders, waiting for a

77
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,469
chance to get into the game.

78
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:24,459
You see, the catch about portrait-painting- -I've looked into the thing a bit--is that

79
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,899
you can't start painting portraits till people come along and ask you to, and they

80
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:33,059
won't come and ask you to until you've painted a lot first.

81
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,749
This makes it kind of difficult for a chappie.

82
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:40,719
Corky managed to get along by drawing an occasional picture for the comic papers--he

83
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,480
had rather a gift for funny stuff when he got a good idea--and doing bedsteads and

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,869
chairs and things for the advertisements.

85
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:53,309
His principal source of income, however, was derived from biting the ear of a rich

86
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:58,719
uncle--one Alexander Worple, who was in the jute business.

87
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:03,079
I'm a bit foggy as to what jute is, but it's apparently something the populace is

88
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,239
pretty keen on, for Mr. Worple had made quite an indecently large stack out of it.

89
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:14,290
Now, a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a pretty soft snap: but,

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,549
according to Corky, such is not the case. Corky's uncle was a robust sort of cove,

91
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,639
who looked like living for ever.

92
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,959
He was fifty-one, and it seemed as if he might go to par.

93
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,230
It was not this, however, that distressed poor old Corky, for he was not bigoted and

94
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,329
had no objection to the man going on living.

95
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:41,019
What Corky kicked at was the way the above Worple used to harry him.

96
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,570
Corky's uncle, you see, didn't want him to be an artist.

97
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,639
He didn't think he had any talent in that direction.

98
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,480
He was always urging him to chuck Art and go into the jute business and start at the

99
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,350
bottom and work his way up.

100
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,579
Jute had apparently become a sort of obsession with him.

101
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,939
He seemed to attach almost a spiritual importance to it.

102
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,399
And what Corky said was that, while he didn't know what they did at the bottom of

103
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,059
the jute business, instinct told him that it was something too beastly for words.

104
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:14,429
Corky, moreover, believed in his future as an artist.

105
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,790
Some day, he said, he was going to make a hit.

106
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,899
Meanwhile, by using the utmost tact and persuasiveness, he was inducing his uncle

107
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:27,279
to cough up very grudgingly a small quarterly allowance.

108
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,519
He wouldn't have got this if his uncle hadn't had a hobby.

109
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,760
Mr. Worple was peculiar in this respect.

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,290
As a rule, from what I've observed, the American captain of industry doesn't do

111
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,779
anything out of business hours.

112
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:46,149
When he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night, he just relapses

113
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,519
into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a captain of industry

114
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,979
again.

115
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:57,309
But Mr. Worple in his spare time was what is known as an ornithologist.

116
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:02,160
He had written a book called American Birds, and was writing another, to be

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,859
called More American Birds.

118
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,179
When he had finished that, the presumption was that he would begin a third, and keep

119
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:13,729
on till the supply of American birds gave out.

120
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,649
Corky used to go to him about once every three months and let him talk about

121
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,549
American birds.

122
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:23,910
Apparently you could do what you liked with old Worple if you gave him his head first

123
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,669
on his pet subject, so these little chats used to make Corky's allowance all right

124
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,850
for the time being.

125
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:36,259
But it was pretty rotten for the poor chap. There was the frightful suspense, you see,

126
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:41,230
and, apart from that, birds, except when broiled and in the society of a cold

127
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,050
bottle, bored him stiff.

128
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,579
To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely uncertain

129
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:55,470
temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor chump and that

130
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,329
whatever step he took in any direction on

131
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,800
his own account, was just another proof of his innate idiocy.

132
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,699
I should imagine Jeeves feels very much the same about me.

133
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,980
So when Corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon, shooing a girl in front of

134
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:18,340
him, and said, "Bertie, I want you to meet my fiancee, Miss Singer," the aspect of the

135
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,050
matter which hit me first was precisely the one which he had come to consult me about.

136
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,900
The very first words I spoke were, "Corky, how about your uncle?"

137
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,460
The poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs.

138
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,069
He was looking anxious and worried, like a man who has done the murder all right but

139
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:41,079
can't think what the deuce to do with the body.

140
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,329
"We're so scared, Mr. Wooster," said the girl.

141
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,480
"We were hoping that you might suggest a way of breaking it to him."

142
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,460
Muriel Singer was one of those very quiet, appealing girls who have a way of looking

143
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,119
at you with their big eyes as if they thought you were the greatest thing on

144
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:01,910
earth and wondered that you hadn't got on to it yet yourself.

145
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,129
She sat there in a sort of shrinking way, looking at me as if she were saying to

146
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:13,040
herself, "Oh, I do hope this great strong man isn't going to hurt me."

147
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,490
She gave a fellow a protective kind of feeling, made him want to stroke her hand

148
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,929
and say, "There, there, little one!" or words to that effect.

149
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:26,860
She made me feel that there was nothing I wouldn't do for her.

150
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,429
She was rather like one of those innocent- tasting American drinks which creep

151
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:35,920
imperceptibly into your system so that, before you know what you're doing, you're

152
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,069
starting out to reform the world by force

153
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:42,850
if necessary and pausing on your way to tell the large man in the corner that, if

154
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,610
he looks at you like that, you will knock his head off.

155
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,220
What I mean is, she made me feel alert and dashing, like a jolly old knight-errant or

156
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,150
something of that kind. I felt that I was with her in this thing to

157
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,199
the limit.

158
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,559
"I don't see why your uncle shouldn't be most awfully bucked," I said to Corky.

159
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,420
"He will think Miss Singer the ideal wife for you."

160
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,020
Corky declined to cheer up.

161
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,569
"You don't know him. Even if he did like Muriel he wouldn't

162
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:16,679
admit it. That's the sort of pig-headed guy he is.

163
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,179
It would be a matter of principle with him to kick.

164
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,379
All he would consider would be that I had gone and taken an important step without

165
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,759
asking his advice, and he would raise Cain automatically.

166
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,759
He's always done it."

167
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,069
I strained the old bean to meet this emergency.

168
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:41,369
"You want to work it so that he makes Miss Singer's acquaintance without knowing that

169
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,470
you know her.

170
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,270
Then you come along----" "But how can I work it that way?"

171
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,970
I saw his point. That was the catch.

172
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,030
"There's only one thing to do," I said.

173
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,270
"What's that?" "Leave it to Jeeves."

174
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:05,259
And I rang the bell. "Sir?" said Jeeves, kind of manifesting

175
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,389
himself.

176
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:12,360
One of the rummy things about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you

177
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,210
very seldom see him come into a room.

178
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,679
He's like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve themselves into thin air

179
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,989
and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts

180
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,059
again just where they want them.

181
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,780
I've got a cousin who's what they call a Theosophist, and he says he's often nearly

182
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,389
worked the thing himself, but couldn't quite bring it off, probably owing to

183
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:42,489
having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie.

184
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:47,449
The moment I saw the man standing there, registering respectful attention, a weight

185
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:49,920
seemed to roll off my mind.

186
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,739
I felt like a lost child who spots his father in the offing.

187
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:58,319
There was something about him that gave me confidence.

188
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:03,410
Jeeves is a tallish man, with one of those dark, shrewd faces.

189
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,119
His eye gleams with the light of pure intelligence.

190
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,090
"Jeeves, we want your advice."

191
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:16,189
"Very good, sir." I boiled down Corky's painful case into a

192
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:21,280
few well-chosen words. "So you see what it amount to, Jeeves.

193
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,629
We want you to suggest some way by which Mr. Worple can make Miss Singer's

194
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:30,319
acquaintance without getting on to the fact that Mr. Corcoran already knows her.

195
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,980
Understand?"

196
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,790
"Perfectly, sir." "Well, try to think of something."

197
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,840
"I have thought of something already, sir." "You have!"

198
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,239
"The scheme I would suggest cannot fail of success, but it has what may seem to you a

199
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:52,319
drawback, sir, in that it requires a certain financial outlay."

200
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:57,199
"He means," I translated to Corky, "that he has got a pippin of an idea, but it's going

201
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,030
to cost a bit." Naturally the poor chap's face dropped, for

202
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,410
this seemed to dish the whole thing.

203
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,020
But I was still under the influence of the girl's melting gaze, and I saw that this

204
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,970
was where I started in as a knight-errant. "You can count on me for all that sort of

205
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,350
thing, Corky," I said.

206
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,290
"Only too glad. Carry on, Jeeves."

207
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,189
"I would suggest, sir, that Mr. Corcoran take advantage of Mr. Worple's attachment

208
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,720
to ornithology."

209
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,420
"How on earth did you know that he was fond of birds?"

210
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,970
"It is the way these New York apartments are constructed, sir.

211
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,549
Quite unlike our London houses.

212
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,220
The partitions between the rooms are of the flimsiest nature.

213
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,879
With no wish to overhear, I have sometimes heard Mr. Corcoran expressing himself with

214
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,410
a generous strength on the subject I have mentioned."

215
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,340
"Oh!

216
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,170
Well?" "Why should not the young lady write a

217
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,449
small volume, to be entitled--let us say-- The Children's Book of American Birds, and

218
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,770
dedicate it to Mr. Worple!

219
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:10,840
A limited edition could be published at your expense, sir, and a great deal of the

220
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,739
book would, of course, be given over to eulogistic remarks concerning Mr. Worple's

221
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,970
own larger treatise on the same subject.

222
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,059
I should recommend the dispatching of a presentation copy to Mr. Worple,

223
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:28,970
immediately on publication, accompanied by a letter in which the young lady asks to be

224
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,220
allowed to make the acquaintance of one to whom she owes so much.

225
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:39,850
This would, I fancy, produce the desired result, but as I say, the expense involved

226
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,429
would be considerable."

227
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:47,960
I felt like the proprietor of a performing dog on the vaudeville stage when the tyke

228
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,420
has just pulled off his trick without a hitch.

229
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,049
I had betted on Jeeves all along, and I had known that he wouldn't let me down.

230
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:02,109
It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing

231
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:04,109
my clothes and whatnot.

232
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:09,739
If I had half Jeeves's brain, I should have a stab, at being Prime Minister or

233
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:12,949
something. "Jeeves," I said, "that is absolutely

234
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:13,989
ripping!

235
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:18,829
One of your very best efforts." "Thank you, sir."

236
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:24,139
The girl made an objection. "But I'm sure I couldn't write a book about

237
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,199
anything.

238
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,020
I can't even write good letters." "Muriel's talents," said Corky, with a

239
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,579
little cough "lie more in the direction of the drama, Bertie.

240
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:39,350
I didn't mention it before, but one of our reasons for being a trifle nervous as to

241
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,980
how Uncle Alexander will receive the news is that Muriel is in the chorus of that

242
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,079
show Choose your Exit at the Manhattan.

243
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:53,160
It's absurdly unreasonable, but we both feel that that fact might increase Uncle

244
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,410
Alexander's natural tendency to kick like a steer."

245
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,869
I saw what he meant.

246
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:02,999
Goodness knows there was fuss enough in our family when I tried to marry into musical

247
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,080
comedy a few years ago.

248
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,100
And the recollection of my Aunt Agatha's attitude in the matter of Gussie and the

249
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,850
vaudeville girl was still fresh in my mind.

250
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:17,450
I don't know why it is--one of these psychology sharps could explain it, I

251
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,860
suppose--but uncles and aunts, as a class, are always dead against the drama,

252
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,880
legitimate or otherwise.

253
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,870
They don't seem able to stick it at any price.

254
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,520
But Jeeves had a solution, of course.

255
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,880
"I fancy it would be a simple matter, sir, to find some impecunious author who would

256
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,930
be glad to do the actual composition of the volume for a small fee.

257
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,970
It is only necessary that the young lady's name should appear on the title page."

258
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,370
"That's true," said Corky. "Sam Patterson would do it for a hundred

259
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,630
dollars.

260
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,810
He writes a novelette, three short stories, and ten thousand words of a serial for one

261
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,690
of the all-fiction magazines under different names every month.

262
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,210
A little thing like this would be nothing to him.

263
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,210
I'll get after him right away." "Fine!"

264
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,610
"Will that be all, sir?" said Jeeves.

265
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,690
"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir."

266
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,980
I always used to think that publishers had to be devilish intelligent fellows, loaded

267
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,810
down with the grey matter; but I've got their number now.

268
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,010
All a publisher has to do is to write cheques at intervals, while a lot of

269
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,850
deserving and industrious chappies rally round and do the real work.

270
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,470
I know, because I've been one myself.

271
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,350
I simply sat tight in the old apartment with a fountain-pen, and in due season a

272
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,160
topping, shiny book came along.

273
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,590
I happened to be down at Corky's place when the first copies of The Children's Book of

274
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,480
American Birds bobbed up.

275
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,300
Muriel Singer was there, and we were talking of things in general when there was

276
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,600
a bang at the door and the parcel was delivered.

277
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,910
It was certainly some book.

278
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,470
It had a red cover with a fowl of some species on it, and underneath the girl's

279
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,440
name in gold letters. I opened a copy at random.

280
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,210
"Often of a spring morning," it said at the top of page twenty-one, "as you wander

281
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,910
through the fields, you will hear the sweet-toned, carelessly flowing warble of

282
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,000
the purple finch linnet.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,770
When you are older you must read all about him in Mr. Alexander Worple's wonderful

284
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,390
book--American Birds." You see.

285
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,740
A boost for the uncle right away.

286
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,490
And only a few pages later there he was in the limelight again in connection with the

287
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,160
yellow-billed cuckoo. It was great stuff.

288
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,140
The more I read, the more I admired the chap who had written it and Jeeves's genius

289
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,830
in putting us on to the wheeze. I didn't see how the uncle could fail to

290
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,670
drop.

291
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,140
You can't call a chap the world's greatest authority on the yellow-billed cuckoo

292
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,670
without rousing a certain disposition towards chumminess in him.

293
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,180
"It's a cert!"

294
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,130
I said. "An absolute cinch!" said Corky.

295
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,060
And a day or two later he meandered up the Avenue to my apartment to tell me that all

296
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,320
was well.

297
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,840
The uncle had written Muriel a letter so dripping with the milk of human kindness

298
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,590
that if he hadn't known Mr. Worple's handwriting Corky would have refused to

299
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,230
believe him the author of it.

300
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,490
Any time it suited Miss Singer to call, said the uncle, he would be delighted to

301
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,190
make her acquaintance. Shortly after this I had to go out of town.

302
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,830
Divers sound sportsmen had invited me to pay visits to their country places, and it

303
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,520
wasn't for several months that I settled down in the city again.

304
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,980
I had been wondering a lot, of course, about Corky, whether it all turned out

305
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,420
right, and so forth, and my first evening in New York, happening to pop into a quiet

306
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,500
sort of little restaurant which I go to

307
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,320
when I don't feel inclined for the bright lights, I found Muriel Singer there,

308
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,250
sitting by herself at a table near the door.

309
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,930
Corky, I took it, was out telephoning.

310
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,210
I went up and passed the time of day. "Well, well, well, what?"

311
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,150
I said. "Why, Mr. Wooster!

312
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,750
How do you do?"

313
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,250
"Corky around?" "I beg your pardon?"

314
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,340
"You're waiting for Corky, aren't you?" "Oh, I didn't understand.

315
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,850
No, I'm not waiting for him."

316
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,010
It seemed to roe that there was a sort of something in her voice, a kind of

317
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,090
thingummy, you know. "I say, you haven't had a row with Corky,

318
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,700
have you?"

319
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,770
"A row?" "A spat, don't you know--little

320
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,710
misunderstanding--faults on both sides--er- -and all that sort of thing."

321
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,660
"Why, whatever makes you think that?"

322
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,740
"Oh, well, as it were, what? What I mean is--I thought you usually dined

323
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,700
with him before you went to the theatre." "I've left the stage now."

324
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,680
Suddenly the whole thing dawned on me.

325
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,560
I had forgotten what a long time I had been away.

326
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,900
"Why, of course, I see now! You're married!"

327
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,320
"Yes."

328
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,760
"How perfectly topping! I wish you all kinds of happiness."

329
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,420
"Thank you, so much. Oh Alexander," she said, looking past me,

330
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,330
"this is a friend of mine--Mr. Wooster."

331
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,140
I spun round. A chappie with a lot of stiff grey hair and

332
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,140
a red sort of healthy face was standing there.

333
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,770
Rather a formidable Johnnie, he looked, though quite peaceful at the moment.

334
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,780
"I want you to meet my husband, Mr. Wooster.

335
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,210
Mr. Wooster is a friend of Bruce's, Alexander."

336
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:42,780
The old boy grasped my hand warmly, and that was all that kept me from hitting the

337
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,010
floor in a heap.

338
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,800
The place was rocking. Absolutely.

339
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,620
"So you know my nephew, Mr. Wooster," I heard him say.

340
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,470
"I wish you would try to knock a little sense into him and make him quit this

341
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,240
playing at painting. But I have an idea that he is steadying

342
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,120
down.

343
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,100
I noticed it first that night he came to dinner with us, my dear, to be introduced

344
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,950
to you. He seemed altogether quieter and more

345
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,210
serious.

346
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,170
Something seemed to have sobered him. Perhaps you will give us the pleasure of

347
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,430
your company at dinner to-night, Mr. Wooster?

348
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,470
Or have you dined?"

349
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,960
I said I had. What I needed then was air, not dinner.

350
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,740
I felt that I wanted to get into the open and think this thing out.

351
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,160
When I reached my apartment I heard Jeeves moving about in his lair.

352
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,830
I called him. "Jeeves," I said, "now is the time for all

353
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,460
good men to come to the aid of the party.

354
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,320
A stiff b.-and-s. first of all, and then I've a bit of news for you."

355
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,030
He came back with a tray and a long glass. "Better have one yourself, Jeeves.

356
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,700
You'll need it."

357
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,630
"Later on, perhaps, thank you, sir." "All right.

358
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,870
Please yourself. But you're going to get a shock.

359
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,290
You remember my friend, Mr. Corcoran?"

360
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,120
"Yes, sir." "And the girl who was to slide gracefully

361
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,870
into his uncle's esteem by writing the book on birds?"

362
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,850
"Perfectly, sir."

363
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,560
"Well, she's slid. She's married the uncle."

364
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,890
He took it without blinking. You can't rattle Jeeves.

365
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,160
"That was always a development to be feared, sir."

366
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,180
"You don't mean to tell me that you were expecting it?"

367
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,210
"It crossed my mind as a possibility."

368
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,170
"Did it, by Jove! Well, I think, you might have warned us!"

369
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,000
"I hardly liked to take the liberty, sir."

370
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,380
Of course, as I saw after I had had a bite to eat and was in a calmer frame of mind,

371
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,110
what had happened wasn't my fault, if you come down to it.

372
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,970
I couldn't be expected to foresee that the scheme, in itself a cracker-jack, would

373
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,950
skid into the ditch as it had done; but all the same I'm bound to admit that I didn't

374
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,790
relish the idea of meeting Corky again

375
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:02,700
until time, the great healer, had been able to get in a bit of soothing work.

376
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,780
I cut Washington Square out absolutely for the next few months.

377
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,340
I gave it the complete miss-in-baulk.

378
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,910
And then, just when I was beginning to think I might safely pop down in that

379
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:19,200
direction and gather up the dropped threads, so to speak, time, instead of

380
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,170
working the healing wheeze, went and pulled the most awful bone and put the lid on it.

381
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,240
Opening the paper one morning, I read that Mrs. Alexander Worple had presented her

382
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,730
husband with a son and heir.

383
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,900
I was so darned sorry for poor old Corky that I hadn't the heart to touch my

384
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,590
breakfast. I told Jeeves to drink it himself.

385
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,770
I was bowled over.

386
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,550
Absolutely. It was the limit.

387
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,600
I hardly knew what to do.

388
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,900
I wanted, of course, to rush down to Washington Square and grip the poor

389
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,760
blighter silently by the hand; and then, thinking it over, I hadn't the nerve.

390
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
Absent treatment seemed the touch.

391
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,400
I gave it him in waves. But after a month or so I began to hesitate

392
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,260
again.

393
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,020
It struck me that it was playing it a bit low-down on the poor chap, avoiding him

394
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,640
like this just when he probably wanted his pals to surge round him most.

395
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,340
I pictured him sitting in his lonely studio with no company but his bitter thoughts,

396
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,300
and the pathos of it got me to such an extent that I bounded straight into a taxi

397
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,740
and told the driver to go all out for the studio.

398
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,690
I rushed in, and there was Corky, hunched up at the easel, painting away, while on

399
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,410
the model throne sat a severe-looking female of middle age, holding a baby.

400
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,260
A fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing.

401
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,890
"Oh, ah!" I said, and started to back out.

402
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,660
Corky looked over his shoulder.

403
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,620
"Halloa, Bertie. Don't go.

404
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,280
We're just finishing for the day.

405
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,770
That will be all this afternoon," he said to the nurse, who got up with the baby and

406
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,290
decanted it into a perambulator which was standing in the fairway.

407
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,490
"At the same hour to-morrow, Mr. Corcoran?"

408
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,170
"Yes, please." "Good afternoon."

409
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,890
"Good afternoon."

410
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,690
Corky stood there, looking at the door, and then he turned to me and began to get it

411
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,550
off his chest.

412
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,410
Fortunately, he seemed to take it for granted that I knew all about what had

413
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,150
happened, so it wasn't as awkward as it might have been.

414
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,740
"It's my uncle's idea," he said.

415
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,320
"Muriel doesn't know about it yet. The portrait's to be a surprise for her on

416
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,720
her birthday. The nurse takes the kid out ostensibly to

417
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,630
get a breather, and they beat it down here.

418
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:49,790
If you want an instance of the irony of fate, Bertie, get acquainted with this.

419
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,790
Here's the first commission I have ever had to paint a portrait, and the sitter is that

420
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,030
human poached egg that has butted in and bounced me out of my inheritance.

421
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,800
Can you beat it!

422
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,390
I call it rubbing the thing in to expect me to spend my afternoons gazing into the ugly

423
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,380
face of a little brat who to all intents and purposes has hit me behind the ear with

424
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,870
a blackjack and swiped all I possess.

425
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,080
I can't refuse to paint the portrait because if I did my uncle would stop my

426
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,530
allowance; yet every time I look up and catch that kid's vacant eye, I suffer

427
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,840
agonies.

428
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,650
I tell you, Bertie, sometimes when he gives me a patronizing glance and then turns away

429
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,610
and is sick, as if it revolted him to look at me, I come within an ace of occupying

430
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,420
the entire front page of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation.

431
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,910
There are moments when I can almost see the headlines: 'Promising Young Artist Beans

432
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,110
Baby With Axe.'"

433
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,570
I patted his shoulder silently. My sympathy for the poor old scout was too

434
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,730
deep for words.

435
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,870
I kept away from the studio for some time after that, because it didn't seem right to

436
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:06,020
me to intrude on the poor chappie's sorrow. Besides, I'm bound to say that nurse

437
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,810
intimidated me.

438
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,670
She reminded me so infernally of Aunt Agatha.

439
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:17,170
She was the same gimlet-eyed type. But one afternoon Corky called me on the

440
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,770
'phone.

441
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,270
"Bertie." "Halloa?"

442
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:26,040
"Are you doing anything this afternoon?" "Nothing special."

443
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,450
"You couldn't come down here, could you?"

444
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,510
"What's the trouble? Anything up?"

445
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,190
"I've finished the portrait." "Good boy!

446
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,890
Stout work!"

447
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,870
"Yes." His voice sounded rather doubtful.

448
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:44,360
"The fact is, Bertie, it doesn't look quite right to me.

449
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,260
There's something about it--My uncle's coming in half an hour to inspect it, and--

450
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,330
I don't know why it is, but I kind of feel I'd like your moral support!"

451
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:59,360
I began to see that I was letting myself in for something.

452
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,730
The sympathetic co-operation of Jeeves seemed to me to be indicated.

453
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,750
"You think he'll cut up rough?"

454
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:10,670
"He may." I threw my mind back to the red-faced

455
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,180
chappie I had met at the restaurant, and tried to picture him cutting up rough.

456
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,280
It was only too easy.

457
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,650
I spoke to Corky firmly on the telephone. "I'll come," I said.

458
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:27,420
"Good!" "But only if I may bring Jeeves!"

459
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,540
"Why Jeeves?

460
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,760
What's Jeeves got to do with it? Who wants Jeeves?

461
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,690
Jeeves is the fool who suggested the scheme that has led----"

462
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,700
"Listen, Corky, old top!

463
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,200
If you think I am going to face that uncle of yours without Jeeves's support, you're

464
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,550
mistaken. I'd sooner go into a den of wild beasts and

465
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,660
bite a lion on the back of the neck."

466
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,800
"Oh, all right," said Corky. Not cordially, but he said it; so I rang

467
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:59,160
for Jeeves, and explained the situation. "Very good, sir," said Jeeves.

468
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,960
That's the sort of chap he is.

469
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,910
You can't rattle him. We found Corky near the door, looking at

470
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,590
the picture, with one hand up in a defensive sort of way, as if he thought it

471
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,940
might swing on him.

472
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,080
"Stand right where you are, Bertie," he said, without moving.

473
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,250
"Now, tell me honestly, how does it strike you?"

474
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,730
The light from the big window fell right on the picture.

475
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,450
I took a good look at it. Then I shifted a bit nearer and took

476
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,470
another look.

477
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,890
Then I went back to where I had been at first, because it hadn't seemed quite so

478
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:40,840
bad from there. "Well?" said Corky, anxiously.

479
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,240
I hesitated a bit.

480
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,660
"Of course, old man, I only saw the kid once, and then only for a moment, but--but

481
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,390
it was an ugly sort of kid, wasn't it, if I remember rightly?"

482
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,190
"As ugly as that?"

483
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,730
I looked again, and honesty compelled me to be frank.

484
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,510
"I don't see how it could have been, old chap."

485
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,870
Poor old Corky ran his fingers through his hair in a temperamental sort of way.

486
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,590
He groaned. "You're right quite, Bertie.

487
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,410
Something's gone wrong with the darned thing.

488
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,890
My private impression is that, without knowing it, I've worked that stunt that

489
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,750
Sargent and those fellows pull--painting the soul of the sitter.

490
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,630
I've got through the mere outward appearance, and have put the child's soul

491
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,170
on canvas." "But could a child of that age have a soul

492
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,570
like that?

493
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,080
I don't see how he could have managed it in the time.

494
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,430
What do you think, Jeeves?" "I doubt it, sir."

495
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,230
"It--it sorts of leers at you, doesn't it?"

496
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:55,660
"You've noticed that, too?" said Corky. "I don't see how one could help noticing."

497
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,550
"All I tried to do was to give the little brute a cheerful expression.

498
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:04,820
But, as it worked out, he looks positively dissipated."

499
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,360
"Just what I was going to suggest, old man.

500
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,260
He looks as if he were in the middle of a colossal spree, and enjoying every minute

501
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,480
of it. Don't you think so, Jeeves?"

502
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,490
"He has a decidedly inebriated air, sir."

503
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:23,710
Corky was starting to say something when the door opened, and the uncle came in.

504
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,950
For about three seconds all was joy, jollity, and goodwill.

505
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,180
The old boy shook hands with me, slapped Corky on the back, said that he didn't

506
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:38,700
think he had ever seen such a fine day, and whacked his leg with his stick.

507
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,800
Jeeves had projected himself into the background, and he didn't notice him.

508
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,540
"Well, Bruce, my boy; so the portrait is really finished, is it--really finished?

509
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,700
Well, bring it out.

510
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,620
Let's have a look at it. This will be a wonderful surprise for your

511
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,660
aunt. Where is it?

512
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,420
Let's----"

513
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,160
And then he got it--suddenly, when he wasn't set for the punch; and he rocked

514
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,699
back on his heels. "Oosh!" he exclaimed.

515
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:12,439
And for perhaps a minute there was one of the scaliest silences I've ever run up

516
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,699
against.

517
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:20,110
"Is this a practical joke?" he said at last, in a way that set about sixteen

518
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,459
draughts cutting through the room at once. I thought it was up to me to rally round

519
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:27,560
old Corky.

520
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,939
"You want to stand a bit farther away from it," I said.

521
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:34,240
"You're perfectly right!" he snorted. "I do!

522
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,870
I want to stand so far away from it that I can't see the thing with a telescope!"

523
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,290
He turned on Corky like an untamed tiger of the jungle who has just located a chunk of

524
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,090
meat.

525
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,469
"And this--this--is what you have been wasting your time and my money for all

526
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:53,010
these years! A painter!

527
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,030
I wouldn't let you paint a house of mine!

528
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,330
I gave you this commission, thinking that you were a competent worker, and this--

529
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,270
this--this extract from a comic coloured supplement is the result!"

530
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,150
He swung towards the door, lashing his tail and growling to himself.

531
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,270
"This ends it!

532
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:17,690
If you wish to continue this foolery of pretending to be an artist because you want

533
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,270
an excuse for idleness, please yourself. But let me tell you this.

534
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:29,260
Unless you report at my office on Monday morning, prepared to abandon all this

535
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,680
idiocy and start in at the bottom of the business to work your way up, as you should

536
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,080
have done half a dozen years ago, not

537
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:44,990
another cent--not another cent--not another--Boosh!"

538
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,230
Then the door closed, and he was no longer with us.

539
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,280
And I crawled out of the bombproof shelter.

540
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,890
"Corky, old top!" I whispered faintly.

541
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,230
Corky was standing staring at the picture. His face was set.

542
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,550
There was a hunted look in his eye.

543
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,360
"Well, that finishes it!" he muttered brokenly.

544
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,300
"What are you going to do?" "Do?

545
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,410
What can I do?

546
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,440
I can't stick on here if he cuts off supplies.

547
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,700
You heard what he said. I shall have to go to the office on

548
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,600
Monday."

549
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,940
I couldn't think of a thing to say. I knew exactly how he felt about the

550
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,630
office. I don't know when I've been so infernally

551
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,960
uncomfortable.

552
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,570
It was like hanging round trying to make conversation to a pal who's just been

553
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:41,240
sentenced to twenty years in quod. And then a soothing voice broke the

554
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,680
silence.

555
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,370
"If I might make a suggestion, sir!" It was Jeeves.

556
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,650
He had slid from the shadows and was gazing gravely at the picture.

557
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,480
Upon my word, I can't give you a better idea of the shattering effect of Corky's

558
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,060
uncle Alexander when in action than by saying that he had absolutely made me

559
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,190
forget for the moment that Jeeves was there.

560
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,050
"I wonder if I have ever happened to mention to you, sir, a Mr. Digby

561
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,170
Thistleton, with whom I was once in service?

562
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,130
Perhaps you have met him?

563
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,490
He was a financier. He is now Lord Bridgnorth.

564
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,150
It was a favourite saying of his that there is always a way.

565
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,580
The first time I heard him use the expression was after the failure of a

566
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:35,930
patent depilatory which he promoted." "Jeeves," I said, "what on earth are you

567
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,780
talking about?"

568
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,970
"I mentioned Mr. Thistleton, sir, because his was in some respects a parallel case to

569
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,780
the present one. His depilatory failed, but he did not

570
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,110
despair.

571
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:55,130
He put it on the market again under the name of Hair-o, guaranteed to produce a

572
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,980
full crop of hair in a few months.

573
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,650
It was advertised, if you remember, sir, by a humorous picture of a billiard-ball,

574
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:09,790
before and after taking, and made such a substantial fortune that Mr. Thistleton was

575
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,860
soon afterwards elevated to the peerage for services to his Party.

576
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:20,890
It seems to me that, if Mr. Corcoran looks into the matter, he will find, like Mr.

577
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,720
Thistleton, that there is always a way.

578
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,950
Mr. Worple himself suggested the solution of the difficulty.

579
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,490
In the heat of the moment he compared the portrait to an extract from a coloured

580
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,540
comic supplement.

581
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:39,680
I consider the suggestion a very valuable one, sir.

582
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,420
Mr. Corcoran's portrait may not have pleased Mr. Worple as a likeness of his

583
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,510
only child, but I have no doubt that editors would gladly consider it as a

584
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,270
foundation for a series of humorous drawings.

585
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:59,010
If Mr. Corcoran will allow me to make the suggestion, his talent has always been for

586
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,720
the humorous.

587
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,830
There is something about this picture-- something bold and vigorous, which arrests

588
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:12,130
the attention. I feel sure it would be highly popular."

589
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,920
Corky was glaring at the picture, and making a sort of dry, sucking noise with

590
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,350
his mouth. He seemed completely overwrought.

591
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:27,360
And then suddenly he began to laugh in a wild way.

592
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,930
"Corky, old man!" I said, massaging him tenderly.

593
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,240
I feared the poor blighter was hysterical.

594
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
He began to stagger about all over the floor.

595
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,900
"He's right! The man's absolutely right!

596
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,410
Jeeves, you're a life-saver!

597
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:50,780
You've hit on the greatest idea of the age! Report at the office on Monday!

598
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,240
Start at the bottom of the business! I'll buy the business if I feel like it.

599
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,410
I know the man who runs the comic section of the Sunday Star.

600
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:04,620
He'll eat this thing. He was telling me only the other day how

601
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,560
hard it was to get a good new series.

602
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,360
He'll give me anything I ask for a real winner like this.

603
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,720
I've got a gold-mine. Where's my hat?

604
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,800
I've got an income for life!

605
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,650
Where's that confounded hat? Lend me a fiver, Bertie.

606
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:28,310
I want to take a taxi down to Park Row!" Jeeves smiled paternally.

607
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,590
Or, rather, he had a kind of paternal muscular spasm about the mouth, which is

608
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,300
the nearest he ever gets to smiling.

609
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,530
"If I might make the suggestion, Mr. Corcoran--for a title of the series which

610
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:47,320
you have in mind--'The Adventures of Baby Blobbs.'"

611
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,940
Corky and I looked at the picture, then at each other in an awed way.

612
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:58,850
Jeeves was right. There could be no other title.

613
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,760
"Jeeves," I said.

614
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,320
It was a few weeks later, and I had just finished looking at the comic section of

615
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,810
the Sunday Star. "I'm an optimist.

616
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,560
I always have been.

617
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,630
The older I get, the more I agree with Shakespeare and those poet Johnnies about

618
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:19,340
it always being darkest before the dawn and there's a silver lining and what you lose

619
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,480
on the swings you make up on the roundabouts.

620
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,350
Look at Mr. Corcoran, for instance. There was a fellow, one would have said,

621
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,919
clear up to the eyebrows in the soup.

622
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:33,560
To all appearances he had got it right in the neck.

623
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,280
Yet look at him now. Have you seen these pictures?"

624
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,660
"I took the liberty of glancing at them before bringing them to you, sir.

625
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:48,520
Extremely diverting." "They have made a big hit, you know."

626
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,890
"I anticipated it, sir."

627
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:56,440
I leaned back against the pillows. "You know, Jeeves, you're a genius.

628
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,850
You ought to be drawing a commission on these things."

629
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,830
"I have nothing to complain of in that respect, sir.

630
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:09,720
Mr. Corcoran has been most generous. I am putting out the brown suit, sir."

631
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,310
"No, I think I'll wear the blue with the faint red stripe."

632
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,280
"Not the blue with the faint red stripe, sir."

633
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,980
"But I rather fancy myself in it."

634
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,840
"Not the blue with the faint red stripe, sir."

635
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:29,450
"Oh, all right, have it your own way." "Very good, sir.

636
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,800
Thank you, sir."

637
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,640
Of course, I know it's as bad as being henpecked; but then Jeeves is always right.

638
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:45,554
You've got to consider that, you know. What?

639
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:46,554
>

640
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:58,804
CHAPTER 2 JEEVES AND THE UNBIDDEN GUEST

641
00:42:58,804 --> 00:43:04,914
I'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare--or, if

642
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:09,914
not, it's some equally brainy lad--who says that it's always just when a chappie is

643
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:12,614
feeling particularly top-hole, and more

644
00:43:12,614 --> 00:43:17,554
than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit

645
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:22,174
of lead piping. There's no doubt the man's right.

646
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:24,774
It's absolutely that way with me.

647
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:30,444
Take, for instance, the fairly rummy matter of Lady Malvern and her son Wilmot.

648
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:34,633
A moment before they turned up, I was just thinking how thoroughly all right

649
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:37,284
everything was.

650
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:41,584
It was one of those topping mornings, and I had just climbed out from under the cold

651
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:44,764
shower, feeling like a two-year-old.

652
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:49,354
As a matter of fact, I was especially bucked just then because the day before I

653
00:43:49,354 --> 00:43:54,873
had asserted myself with Jeeves--absolutely asserted myself, don't you know.

654
00:43:54,873 --> 00:44:00,493
You see, the way things had been going on I was rapidly becoming a dashed serf.

655
00:44:00,493 --> 00:44:03,123
The man had jolly well oppressed me.

656
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:08,224
I didn't so much mind when he made me give up one of my new suits, because, Jeeves's

657
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:10,633
judgment about suits is sound.

658
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:15,403
But I as near as a toucher rebelled when he wouldn't let me wear a pair of cloth-topped

659
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,763
boots which I loved like a couple of brothers.

660
00:44:18,763 --> 00:44:23,583
And when he tried to tread on me like a worm in the matter of a hat, I jolly well

661
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,993
put my foot down and showed him who was who.

662
00:44:26,993 --> 00:44:31,864
It's a long story, and I haven't time to tell you now, but the point is that he

663
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:37,254
wanted me to wear the Longacre--as worn by John Drew--when I had set my heart on the

664
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:39,043
Country Gentleman--as worn by another

665
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:44,053
famous actor chappie--and the end of the matter was that, after a rather painful

666
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:47,293
scene, I bought the Country Gentleman.

667
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:51,223
So that's how things stood on this particular morning, and I was feeling kind

668
00:44:51,223 --> 00:44:53,593
of manly and independent.

669
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:58,064
Well, I was in the bathroom, wondering what there was going to be for breakfast while I

670
00:44:58,064 --> 00:45:03,144
massaged the good old spine with a rough towel and sang slightly, when there was a

671
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:04,724
tap at the door.

672
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:08,543
I stopped singing and opened the door an inch.

673
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:14,414
"What ho without there!" "Lady Malvern wishes to see you, sir," said

674
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:15,454
Jeeves.

675
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:18,484
"Eh?" "Lady Malvern, sir.

676
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:20,614
She is waiting in the sitting-room."

677
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:25,974
"Pull yourself together, Jeeves, my man," I said, rather severely, for I bar practical

678
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:30,123
jokes before breakfast. "You know perfectly well there's no one

679
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:32,194
waiting for me in the sitting-room.

680
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:35,174
How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?"

681
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:40,034
"I gathered from her ladyship, sir, that she had landed from an ocean liner at an

682
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:42,844
early hour this morning."

683
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:44,933
This made the thing a bit more plausible.

684
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:49,213
I remembered that when I had arrived in America about a year before, the

685
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:53,844
proceedings had begun at some ghastly hour like six, and that I had been shot out on

686
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:58,224
to a foreign shore considerably before eight.

687
00:45:58,224 --> 00:46:05,403
"Who the deuce is Lady Malvern, Jeeves?" "Her ladyship did not confide in me, sir."

688
00:46:05,403 --> 00:46:07,234
"Is she alone?"

689
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:11,114
"Her ladyship is accompanied by a Lord Pershore, sir.

690
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:14,834
I fancy that his lordship would be her ladyship's son."

691
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:18,773
"Oh, well, put out rich raiment of sorts, and I'll be dressing."

692
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:23,273
"Our heather-mixture lounge is in readiness, sir."

693
00:46:23,273 --> 00:46:26,963
"Then lead me to it."

694
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:32,653
While I was dressing I kept trying to think who on earth Lady Malvern could be.

695
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:35,954
It wasn't till I had climbed through the top of my shirt and was reaching out for

696
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:37,243
the studs that I remembered.

697
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:42,493
"I've placed her, Jeeves. She's a pal of my Aunt Agatha."

698
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:45,413
"Indeed, sir?" "Yes.

699
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:48,513
I met her at lunch one Sunday before I left London.

700
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:51,573
A very vicious specimen. Writes books.

701
00:46:51,573 --> 00:46:56,083
She wrote a book on social conditions in India when she came back from the Durbar."

702
00:46:56,083 --> 00:47:01,144
"Yes, sir? Pardon me, sir, but not that tie!"

703
00:47:01,144 --> 00:47:02,754
"Eh?"

704
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:07,073
"Not that tie with the heather-mixture lounge, sir!"

705
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:10,794
It was a shock to me. I thought I had quelled the fellow.

706
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,824
It was rather a solemn moment.

707
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:17,864
What I mean is, if I weakened now, all my good work the night before would be thrown

708
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:19,864
away. I braced myself.

709
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:22,943
"What's wrong with this tie?

710
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:26,653
I've seen you give it a nasty look before. Speak out like a man!

711
00:47:26,653 --> 00:47:30,943
What's the matter with it?" "Too ornate, sir."

712
00:47:30,943 --> 00:47:32,054
"Nonsense!

713
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:34,514
A cheerful pink. Nothing more."

714
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:40,744
"Unsuitable, sir." "Jeeves, this is the tie I wear!"

715
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:43,533
"Very good, sir."

716
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:47,264
Dashed unpleasant. I could see that the man was wounded.

717
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:52,114
But I was firm. I tied the tie, got into the coat and

718
00:47:52,114 --> 00:47:54,204
waistcoat, and went into the sitting-room.

719
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,924
"Halloa! Halloa!

720
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:58,494
Halloa!" I said.

721
00:47:58,494 --> 00:47:59,354
"What?"

722
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:02,824
"Ah! How do you do, Mr. Wooster?

723
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:09,283
You have never met my son, Wilmot, I think? Motty, darling, this is Mr. Wooster."

724
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:15,264
Lady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashed female, not so

725
00:48:15,264 --> 00:48:20,204
very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feet from the O.P. to the Prompt

726
00:48:20,204 --> 00:48:21,304
Side.

727
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:26,274
She fitted into my biggest arm-chair as if it had been built round her by someone who

728
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:30,524
knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season.

729
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:35,824
She had bright, bulging eyes and a lot of yellow hair, and when she spoke she showed

730
00:48:35,824 --> 00:48:41,524
about fifty-seven front teeth. She was one of those women who kind of numb

731
00:48:41,524 --> 00:48:43,664
a fellow's faculties.

732
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:47,864
She made me feel as if I were ten years old and had been brought into the drawing-room

733
00:48:47,864 --> 00:48:50,973
in my Sunday clothes to say how-d'you-do.

734
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:55,473
Altogether by no means the sort of thing a chappie would wish to find in his sitting-

735
00:48:55,473 --> 00:49:01,223
room before breakfast. Motty, the son, was about twenty-three,

736
00:49:01,223 --> 00:49:04,774
tall and thin and meek-looking.

737
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:09,294
He had the same yellow hair as his mother, but he wore it plastered down and parted in

738
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:12,914
the middle. His eyes bulged, too, but they weren't

739
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:14,283
bright.

740
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:19,074
They were a dull grey with pink rims. His chin gave up the struggle about half-

741
00:49:19,074 --> 00:49:22,753
way down, and he didn't appear to have any eyelashes.

742
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:28,183
A mild, furtive, sheepish sort of blighter, in short.

743
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:32,324
"Awfully glad to see you," I said. "So you've popped over, eh?

744
00:49:32,324 --> 00:49:35,304
Making a long stay in America?"

745
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:37,873
"About a month. Your aunt gave me your address and told me

746
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:40,683
to be sure and call on you."

747
00:49:40,683 --> 00:49:46,014
I was glad to hear this, as it showed that Aunt Agatha was beginning to come round a

748
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:46,373
bit.

749
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:49,693
There had been some unpleasantness a year before, when she had sent me over to New

750
00:49:49,693 --> 00:49:53,554
York to disentangle my Cousin Gussie from the clutches of a girl on the music-hall

751
00:49:53,554 --> 00:49:55,604
stage.

752
00:49:55,604 --> 00:50:00,264
When I tell you that by the time I had finished my operations, Gussie had not only

753
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:05,734
married the girl but had gone on the stage himself, and was doing well, you'll

754
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:10,424
understand that Aunt Agatha was upset to no small extent.

755
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:16,593
I simply hadn't dared go back and face her, and it was a relief to find that time had

756
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:20,783
healed the wound and all that sort of thing enough to make her tell her pals to look me

757
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:22,394
up.

758
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:27,493
What I mean is, much as I liked America, I didn't want to have England barred to me

759
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:31,924
for the rest of my natural; and, believe me, England is a jolly sight too small for

760
00:50:31,924 --> 00:50:36,033
anyone to live in with Aunt Agatha, if she's really on the warpath.

761
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:42,084
So I braced on hearing these kind words and smiled genially on the assemblage.

762
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:45,414
"Your aunt said that you would do anything that was in your power to be of assistance

763
00:50:45,414 --> 00:50:47,514
to us." "Rather?

764
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:48,503
Oh, rather!

765
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:52,174
Absolutely!" "Thank you so much.

766
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,963
I want you to put dear Motty up for a little while."

767
00:50:55,963 --> 00:50:58,183
I didn't get this for a moment.

768
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,843
"Put him up? For my clubs?"

769
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:04,704
"No, no! Darling Motty is essentially a home bird.

770
00:51:04,704 --> 00:51:06,433
Aren't you, Motty darling?"

771
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,993
Motty, who was sucking the knob of his stick, uncorked himself.

772
00:51:09,993 --> 00:51:14,384
"Yes, mother," he said, and corked himself up again.

773
00:51:14,384 --> 00:51:17,604
"I should not like him to belong to clubs.

774
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:25,094
I mean put him up here. Have him to live with you while I am away."

775
00:51:25,094 --> 00:51:28,574
These frightful words trickled out of her like honey.

776
00:51:28,574 --> 00:51:33,724
The woman simply didn't seem to understand the ghastly nature of her proposal.

777
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:38,894
I gave Motty the swift east-to-west. He was sitting with his mouth nuzzling the

778
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,344
stick, blinking at the wall.

779
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:45,634
The thought of having this planted on me for an indefinite period appalled me.

780
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:47,874
Absolutely appalled me, don't you know.

781
00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:53,154
I was just starting to say that the shot wasn't on the board at any price, and that

782
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:57,284
the first sign Motty gave of trying to nestle into my little home I would yell for

783
00:51:57,284 --> 00:52:03,474
the police, when she went on, rolling placidly over me, as it were.

784
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:06,274
There was something about this woman that sapped a chappie's will-power.

785
00:52:06,274 --> 00:52:12,244
"I am leaving New York by the midday train, as I have to pay a visit to Sing-Sing

786
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:15,204
prison. I am extremely interested in prison

787
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:16,954
conditions in America.

788
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:21,024
After that I work my way gradually across to the coast, visiting the points of

789
00:52:21,024 --> 00:52:25,064
interest on the journey. You see, Mr. Wooster, I am in America

790
00:52:25,064 --> 00:52:27,134
principally on business.

791
00:52:27,134 --> 00:52:30,804
No doubt you read my book, India and the Indians?

792
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:35,644
My publishers are anxious for me to write a companion volume on the United States.

793
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:39,704
I shall not be able to spend more than a month in the country, as I have to get back

794
00:52:39,704 --> 00:52:42,514
for the season, but a month should be ample.

795
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:47,894
I was less than a month in India, and my dear friend Sir Roger Cremorne wrote his

796
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:51,094
America from Within after a stay of only two weeks.

797
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:55,474
I should love to take dear Motty with me, but the poor boy gets so sick when he

798
00:52:55,474 --> 00:52:59,024
travels by train. I shall have to pick him up on my return."

799
00:52:59,024 --> 00:53:05,934
From where I sat I could see Jeeves in the dining-room, laying the breakfast-table.

800
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:09,054
I wished I could have had a minute with him alone.

801
00:53:09,054 --> 00:53:14,894
I felt certain that he would have been able to think of some way of putting a stop to

802
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:17,694
this woman. "It will be such a relief to know that

803
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,884
Motty is safe with you, Mr. Wooster.

804
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:22,924
I know what the temptations of a great city are.

805
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:25,744
Hitherto dear Motty has been sheltered from them.

806
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,724
He has lived quietly with me in the country.

807
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:31,684
I know that you will look after him carefully, Mr. Wooster.

808
00:53:31,684 --> 00:53:34,574
He will give very little trouble."

809
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:37,804
She talked about the poor blighter as if he wasn't there.

810
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:41,884
Not that Motty seemed to mind. He had stopped chewing his walking-stick

811
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,514
and was sitting there with his mouth open.

812
00:53:43,514 --> 00:53:49,514
"He is a vegetarian and a teetotaller and is devoted to reading.

813
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:52,714
Give him a nice book and he will be quite contented."

814
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:54,184
She got up.

815
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:58,294
"Thank you so much, Mr. Wooster! I don't know what I should have done

816
00:53:58,294 --> 00:54:01,424
without your help. Come, Motty!

817
00:54:01,424 --> 00:54:05,414
We have just time to see a few of the sights before my train goes.

818
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:10,074
But I shall have to rely on you for most of my information about New York, darling.

819
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:13,814
Be sure to keep your eyes open and take notes of your impressions!

820
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:17,244
It will be such a help. Good-bye, Mr. Wooster.

821
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:21,214
I will send Motty back early in the afternoon."

822
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:25,784
They went out, and I howled for Jeeves. "Jeeves!

823
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:27,924
What about it?"

824
00:54:27,924 --> 00:54:31,184
"Sir?" "What's to be done?

825
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,754
You heard it all, didn't you? You were in the dining-room most of the

826
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:35,164
time.

827
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:39,884
That pill is coming to stay here." "Pill, sir?"

828
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:45,134
"The excrescence." "I beg your pardon, sir?"

829
00:54:45,134 --> 00:54:47,514
I looked at Jeeves sharply.

830
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:51,674
This sort of thing wasn't like him. It was as if he were deliberately trying to

831
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:55,554
give me the pip. Then I understood.

832
00:54:55,554 --> 00:54:58,434
The man was really upset about that tie.

833
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:05,264
He was trying to get his own back. "Lord Pershore will be staying here from

834
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:10,014
to-night, Jeeves," I said coldly. "Very good, sir.

835
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:13,214
Breakfast is ready, sir."

836
00:55:13,214 --> 00:55:15,984
I could have sobbed into the bacon and eggs.

837
00:55:15,984 --> 00:55:20,994
That there wasn't any sympathy to be got out of Jeeves was what put the lid on it.

838
00:55:20,994 --> 00:55:25,064
For a moment I almost weakened and told him to destroy the hat and tie if he didn't

839
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:28,124
like them, but I pulled myself together again.

840
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:32,674
I was dashed if I was going to let Jeeves treat me like a bally one-man chain-gang!

841
00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:38,594
But, what with brooding on Jeeves and brooding on Motty, I was in a pretty

842
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:40,774
reduced sort of state.

843
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:45,324
The more I examined the situation, the more blighted it became.

844
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:46,864
There was nothing I could do.

845
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:53,564
If I slung Motty out, he would report to his mother, and she would pass it on to

846
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:59,374
Aunt Agatha, and I didn't like to think what would happen then.

847
00:55:59,374 --> 00:56:03,624
Sooner or later, I should be wanting to go back to England, and I didn't want to get

848
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:08,034
there and find Aunt Agatha waiting on the quay for me with a stuffed eelskin.

849
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:15,554
There was absolutely nothing for it but to put the fellow up and make the best of it.

850
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:21,064
About midday Motty's luggage arrived, and soon afterward a large parcel of what I

851
00:56:21,064 --> 00:56:23,284
took to be nice books.

852
00:56:23,284 --> 00:56:28,434
I brightened up a little when I saw it. It was one of those massive parcels and

853
00:56:28,434 --> 00:56:31,634
looked as if it had enough in it to keep the chappie busy for a year.

854
00:56:31,634 --> 00:56:37,804
I felt a trifle more cheerful, and I got my Country Gentleman hat and stuck it on my

855
00:56:37,804 --> 00:56:42,944
head, and gave the pink tie a twist, and reeled out to take a bite of lunch with one

856
00:56:42,944 --> 00:56:44,714
or two of the lads at a neighbouring

857
00:56:44,714 --> 00:56:49,734
hostelry; and what with excellent browsing and sluicing and cheery conversation and

858
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:53,214
what-not, the afternoon passed quite happily.

859
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:56,824
By dinner-time I had almost forgotten blighted Motty's existence.

860
00:56:56,824 --> 00:57:04,754
I dined at the club and looked in at a show afterward, and it wasn't till fairly late

861
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,754
that I got back to the flat.

862
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:11,814
There were no signs of Motty, and I took it that he had gone to bed.

863
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:15,704
It seemed rummy to me, though, that the parcel of nice books was still there with

864
00:57:15,704 --> 00:57:17,424
the string and paper on it.

865
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:22,174
It looked as if Motty, after seeing mother off at the station, had decided to call it

866
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:26,384
a day. Jeeves came in with the nightly whisky-and-

867
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:27,544
soda.

868
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:32,714
I could tell by the chappie's manner that he was still upset.

869
00:57:32,714 --> 00:57:37,064
"Lord Pershore gone to bed, Jeeves?" I asked, with reserved hauteur and what-

870
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:38,734
not.

871
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:42,914
"No, sir. His lordship has not yet returned."

872
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:46,164
"Not returned? What do you mean?"

873
00:57:46,164 --> 00:57:50,694
"His lordship came in shortly after six- thirty, and, having dressed, went out

874
00:57:50,694 --> 00:57:52,294
again."

875
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:57,904
At this moment there was a noise outside the front door, a sort of scrabbling noise,

876
00:57:57,904 --> 00:58:01,184
as if somebody were trying to paw his way through the woodwork.

877
00:58:01,184 --> 00:58:04,414
Then a sort of thud.

878
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:08,034
"Better go and see what that is, Jeeves." "Very good, sir."

879
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:11,064
He went out and came back again.

880
00:58:11,064 --> 00:58:15,314
"If you would not mind stepping this way, sir, I think we might be able to carry him

881
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:18,484
in." "Carry him in?"

882
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:20,604
"His lordship is lying on the mat, sir."

883
00:58:20,604 --> 00:58:25,334
I went to the front door. The man was right.

884
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:28,354
There was Motty huddled up outside on the floor.

885
00:58:28,354 --> 00:58:30,404
He was moaning a bit.

886
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:35,944
"He's had some sort of dashed fit," I said. I took another look.

887
00:58:35,944 --> 00:58:39,424
"Jeeves! Someone's been feeding him meat!"

888
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:40,124
"Sir?"

889
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:44,814
"He's a vegetarian, you know. He must have been digging into a steak or

890
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:47,064
something. Call up a doctor!"

891
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:49,694
"I hardly think it will be necessary, sir.

892
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,104
If you would take his lordship's legs, while I----"

893
00:58:52,104 --> 00:58:56,404
"Great Scot, Jeeves! You don't think--he can't be----"

894
00:58:56,404 --> 00:58:59,934
"I am inclined to think so, sir."

895
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:03,664
And, by Jove, he was right! Once on the right track, you couldn't

896
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:07,364
mistake it. Motty was under the surface.

897
00:59:07,364 --> 00:59:10,244
It was the deuce of a shock.

898
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:14,634
"You never can tell, Jeeves!" "Very seldom, sir."

899
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,214
"Remove the eye of authority and where are you?"

900
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:18,904
"Precisely, sir."

901
00:59:18,904 --> 00:59:22,494
"Where is my wandering boy to-night and all that sort of thing, what?"

902
00:59:22,494 --> 00:59:27,384
"It would seem so, sir." "Well, we had better bring him in, eh?"

903
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:28,984
"Yes, sir."

904
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:33,884
So we lugged him in, and Jeeves put him to bed, and I lit a cigarette and sat down to

905
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:38,054
think the thing over. I had a kind of foreboding.

906
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:43,604
It seemed to me that I had let myself in for something pretty rocky.

907
00:59:43,604 --> 00:59:47,774
Next morning, after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea, I went into Motty's

908
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:49,964
room to investigate.

909
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:54,664
I expected to find the fellow a wreck, but there he was, sitting up in bed, quite

910
00:59:54,664 --> 00:59:58,863
chirpy, reading Gingery stories. "What ho!"

911
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:00,103
I said.

912
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:02,113
"What ho!" said Motty. "What ho!

913
01:00:02,113 --> 01:00:03,794
What ho!" "What ho!

914
01:00:03,794 --> 01:00:04,253
What ho!

915
01:00:04,253 --> 01:00:07,804
What ho!" After that it seemed rather difficult to go

916
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,993
on with the conversation. "How are you feeling this morning?"

917
01:00:11,993 --> 01:00:12,983
I asked.

918
01:00:12,983 --> 01:00:17,244
"Topping!" replied Motty, blithely and with abandon.

919
01:00:17,244 --> 01:00:21,664
"I say, you know, that fellow of yours-- Jeeves, you know--is a corker.

920
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:26,304
I had a most frightful headache when I woke up, and he brought me a sort of rummy dark

921
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:31,284
drink, and it put me right again at once. Said it was his own invention.

922
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:32,914
I must see more of that lad.

923
01:00:32,914 --> 01:00:38,113
He seems to me distinctly one of the ones!" I couldn't believe that this was the same

924
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:42,534
blighter who had sat and sucked his stick the day before.

925
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:45,654
"You ate something that disagreed with you last night, didn't you?"

926
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:49,914
I said, by way of giving him a chance to slide out of it if he wanted to.

927
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:52,563
But he wouldn't have it, at any price.

928
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:56,583
"No!" he replied firmly. "I didn't do anything of the kind.

929
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:59,264
I drank too much! Much too much.

930
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:01,404
Lots and lots too much!

931
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:05,713
And, what's more, I'm going to do it again! I'm going to do it every night.

932
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:12,164
If ever you see me sober, old top," he said, with a kind of holy exaltation, "tap

933
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:13,983
me on the shoulder and say, 'Tut!

934
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,733
Tut!' and I'll apologize and remedy the defect."

935
01:01:16,733 --> 01:01:23,764
"But I say, you know, what about me?" "What about you?"

936
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:28,943
"Well, I'm so to speak, as it were, kind of responsible for you.

937
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:33,274
What I mean to say is, if you go doing this sort of thing I'm apt to get in the soup

938
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:35,144
somewhat."

939
01:01:35,144 --> 01:01:38,483
"I can't help your troubles," said Motty firmly.

940
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:43,504
"Listen to me, old thing: this is the first time in my life that I've had a real chance

941
01:01:43,504 --> 01:01:46,174
to yield to the temptations of a great city.

942
01:01:46,174 --> 01:01:50,914
What's the use of a great city having temptations if fellows don't yield to them?

943
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:54,473
Makes it so bally discouraging for a great city.

944
01:01:54,473 --> 01:01:59,713
Besides, mother told me to keep my eyes open and collect impressions."

945
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:03,933
I sat on the edge of the bed. I felt dizzy.

946
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:07,853
"I know just how you feel, old dear," said Motty consolingly.

947
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:12,264
"And, if my principles would permit it, I would simmer down for your sake.

948
01:02:12,264 --> 01:02:14,164
But duty first!

949
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:18,723
This is the first time I've been let out alone, and I mean to make the most of it.

950
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:23,024
We're only young once. Why interfere with life's morning?

951
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,363
Young man, rejoice in thy youth!

952
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:28,213
Tra-la! What ho!"

953
01:02:28,213 --> 01:02:31,174
Put like that, it did seem reasonable.

954
01:02:31,174 --> 01:02:36,103
"All my bally life, dear boy," Motty went on, "I've been cooped up in the ancestral

955
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:41,144
home at Much Middlefold, in Shropshire, and till you've been cooped up in Much

956
01:02:41,144 --> 01:02:43,713
Middlefold you don't know what cooping is!

957
01:02:43,713 --> 01:02:47,404
The only time we get any excitement is when one of the choir-boys is caught sucking

958
01:02:47,404 --> 01:02:51,424
chocolate during the sermon. When that happens, we talk about it for

959
01:02:51,424 --> 01:02:52,813
days.

960
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:57,394
I've got about a month of New York, and I mean to store up a few happy memories for

961
01:02:57,394 --> 01:03:02,453
the long winter evenings. This is my only chance to collect a past,

962
01:03:02,453 --> 01:03:04,044
and I'm going to do it.

963
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:09,164
Now tell me, old sport, as man to man, how does one get in touch with that very decent

964
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:12,884
chappie Jeeves? Does one ring a bell or shout a bit?

965
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:17,463
I should like to discuss the subject of a good stiff b.-and-s. with him!"

966
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:22,624
I had had a sort of vague idea, don't you know, that if I stuck close to Motty and

967
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:27,624
went about the place with him, I might act as a bit of a damper on the gaiety.

968
01:03:27,624 --> 01:03:32,384
What I mean is, I thought that if, when he was being the life and soul of the party,

969
01:03:32,384 --> 01:03:37,144
he were to catch my reproving eye he might ease up a trifle on the revelry.

970
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:40,534
So the next night I took him along to supper with me.

971
01:03:40,534 --> 01:03:42,943
It was the last time.

972
01:03:42,943 --> 01:03:47,583
I'm a quiet, peaceful sort of chappie who has lived all his life in London, and I

973
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:51,803
can't stand the pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set.

974
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:56,693
What I mean to say is this, I'm all for rational enjoyment and so forth, but I

975
01:03:56,693 --> 01:04:00,784
think a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws soft-boiled eggs at the

976
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:02,843
electric fan.

977
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:07,303
And decent mirth and all that sort of thing are all right, but I do bar dancing on

978
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:11,193
tables and having to dash all over the place dodging waiters, managers, and

979
01:04:11,193 --> 01:04:15,674
chuckers-out, just when you want to sit still and digest.

980
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:20,813
Directly I managed to tear myself away that night and get home, I made up my mind that

981
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:24,914
this was jolly well the last time that I went about with Motty.

982
01:04:24,914 --> 01:04:28,963
The only time I met him late at night after that was once when I passed the door of a

983
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:33,524
fairly low-down sort of restaurant and had to step aside to dodge him as he sailed

984
01:04:33,524 --> 01:04:35,433
through the air en route for the opposite

985
01:04:35,433 --> 01:04:39,983
pavement, with a muscular sort of looking chappie peering out after him with a kind

986
01:04:39,983 --> 01:04:44,904
of gloomy satisfaction. In a way, I couldn't help sympathizing with

987
01:04:44,904 --> 01:04:46,404
the fellow.

988
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:50,514
He had about four weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over

989
01:04:50,514 --> 01:04:55,063
about ten years, and I didn't wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy.

990
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,674
I should have been just the same in his place.

991
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:01,843
Still, there was no denying that it was a bit thick.

992
01:05:01,843 --> 01:05:06,363
If it hadn't been for the thought of Lady Malvern and Aunt Agatha in the background,

993
01:05:06,363 --> 01:05:10,494
I should have regarded Motty's rapid work with an indulgent smile.

994
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:14,914
But I couldn't get rid of the feeling that, sooner or later, I was the lad who was

995
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:17,294
scheduled to get it behind the ear.

996
01:05:17,294 --> 01:05:21,693
And what with brooding on this prospect, and sitting up in the old flat waiting for

997
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:25,823
the familiar footstep, and putting it to bed when it got there, and stealing into

998
01:05:25,823 --> 01:05:27,233
the sick-chamber next morning to

999
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:31,333
contemplate the wreckage, I was beginning to lose weight.

1000
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:35,754
Absolutely becoming the good old shadow, I give you my honest word.

1001
01:05:35,754 --> 01:05:38,674
Starting at sudden noises and what-not.

1002
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:43,654
And no sympathy from Jeeves. That was what cut me to the quick.

1003
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:48,203
The man was still thoroughly pipped about the hat and tie, and simply wouldn't rally

1004
01:05:48,203 --> 01:05:50,004
round.

1005
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:54,674
One morning I wanted comforting so much that I sank the pride of the Woosters and

1006
01:05:54,674 --> 01:06:00,593
appealed to the fellow direct. "Jeeves," I said, "this is getting a bit

1007
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:02,744
thick!"

1008
01:06:02,744 --> 01:06:07,164
"Sir?" Business and cold respectfulness.

1009
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:10,953
"You know what I mean. This lad seems to have chucked all the

1010
01:06:10,953 --> 01:06:13,213
principles of a well-spent boyhood.

1011
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:17,164
He has got it up his nose!" "Yes, sir."

1012
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:22,144
"Well, I shall get blamed, don't you know. You know what my Aunt Agatha is!"

1013
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,593
"Yes, sir."

1014
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:29,603
"Very well, then." I waited a moment, but he wouldn't unbend.

1015
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:33,384
"Jeeves," I said, "haven't you any scheme up your sleeve for coping with this

1016
01:06:33,384 --> 01:06:34,423
blighter?"

1017
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:37,904
"No, sir." And he shimmered off to his lair.

1018
01:06:37,904 --> 01:06:43,313
Obstinate devil! So dashed absurd, don't you know.

1019
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:47,213
It wasn't as if there was anything wrong with that Country Gentleman hat.

1020
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:51,083
It was a remarkably priceless effort, and much admired by the lads.

1021
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:56,103
But, just because he preferred the Longacre, he left me flat.

1022
01:06:56,103 --> 01:07:00,343
It was shortly after this that young Motty got the idea of bringing pals back in the

1023
01:07:00,343 --> 01:07:04,124
small hours to continue the gay revels in the home.

1024
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:06,843
This was where I began to crack under the strain.

1025
01:07:06,843 --> 01:07:10,914
You see, the part of town where I was living wasn't the right place for that sort

1026
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:11,223
of thing.

1027
01:07:11,223 --> 01:07:16,274
I knew lots of chappies down Washington Square way who started the evening at about

1028
01:07:16,274 --> 01:07:21,894
2 a.m.--artists and writers and what-not, who frolicked considerably till checked by

1029
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:23,923
the arrival of the morning milk.

1030
01:07:23,923 --> 01:07:28,703
That was all right. They like that sort of thing down there.

1031
01:07:28,703 --> 01:07:32,223
The neighbours can't get to sleep unless there's someone dancing Hawaiian dances

1032
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,483
over their heads.

1033
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:38,233
But on Fifty-seventh Street the atmosphere wasn't right, and when Motty turned up at

1034
01:07:38,233 --> 01:07:42,083
three in the morning with a collection of hearty lads, who only stopped singing their

1035
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:44,343
college song when they started singing "The

1036
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:48,973
Old Oaken Bucket," there was a marked peevishness among the old settlers in the

1037
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:50,154
flats.

1038
01:07:50,154 --> 01:07:54,933
The management was extremely terse over the telephone at breakfast-time, and took a lot

1039
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:57,524
of soothing.

1040
01:07:57,524 --> 01:08:02,583
The next night I came home early, after a lonely dinner at a place which I'd chosen

1041
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:06,423
because there didn't seem any chance of meeting Motty there.

1042
01:08:06,423 --> 01:08:10,943
The sitting-room was quite dark, and I was just moving to switch on the light, when

1043
01:08:10,943 --> 01:08:15,644
there was a sort of explosion and something collared hold of my trouser-leg.

1044
01:08:15,644 --> 01:08:19,784
Living with Motty had reduced me to such an extent that I was simply unable to cope

1045
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:21,203
with this thing.

1046
01:08:21,203 --> 01:08:25,874
I jumped backward with a loud yell of anguish, and tumbled out into the hall just

1047
01:08:25,874 --> 01:08:29,004
as Jeeves came out of his den to see what the matter was.

1048
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,683
"Did you call, sir?"

1049
01:08:31,683 --> 01:08:33,904
"Jeeves! There's something in there that grabs you

1050
01:08:33,904 --> 01:08:38,053
by the leg!" "That would be Rollo, sir."

1051
01:08:38,053 --> 01:08:39,713
"Eh?"

1052
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:43,823
"I would have warned you of his presence, but I did not hear you come in.

1053
01:08:43,823 --> 01:08:48,683
His temper is a little uncertain at present, as he has not yet settled down."

1054
01:08:48,683 --> 01:08:50,884
"Who the deuce is Rollo?"

1055
01:08:50,884 --> 01:08:55,794
"His lordship's bull-terrier, sir. His lordship won him in a raffle, and tied

1056
01:08:55,794 --> 01:08:59,894
him to the leg of the table. If you will allow me, sir, I will go in and

1057
01:08:59,894 --> 01:09:03,164
switch on the light."

1058
01:09:03,164 --> 01:09:07,733
There really is nobody like Jeeves. He walked straight into the sitting-room,

1059
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:12,073
the biggest feat since Daniel and the lions' den, without a quiver.

1060
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:16,774
What's more, his magnetism or whatever they call it was such that the dashed animal,

1061
01:09:16,774 --> 01:09:21,933
instead of pinning him by the leg, calmed down as if he had had a bromide, and rolled

1062
01:09:21,933 --> 01:09:25,524
over on his back with all his paws in the air.

1063
01:09:25,524 --> 01:09:30,083
If Jeeves had been his rich uncle he couldn't have been more chummy.

1064
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:34,254
Yet directly he caught sight of me again, he got all worked up and seemed to have

1065
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:38,774
only one idea in life--to start chewing me where he had left off.

1066
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:44,213
"Rollo is not used to you yet, sir," said Jeeves, regarding the bally quadruped in an

1067
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:48,363
admiring sort of way. "He is an excellent watchdog."

1068
01:09:48,363 --> 01:09:51,744
"I don't want a watchdog to keep me out of my rooms."

1069
01:09:51,744 --> 01:09:55,764
"No, sir." "Well, what am I to do?"

1070
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:59,504
"No doubt in time the animal will learn to discriminate, sir.

1071
01:09:59,504 --> 01:10:03,044
He will learn to distinguish your peculiar scent."

1072
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:06,134
"What do you mean--my peculiar scent?

1073
01:10:06,134 --> 01:10:10,293
Correct the impression that I intend to hang about in the hall while life slips by,

1074
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:14,213
in the hope that one of these days that dashed animal will decide that I smell all

1075
01:10:14,213 --> 01:10:16,293
right."

1076
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:19,213
I thought for a bit. "Jeeves!"

1077
01:10:19,213 --> 01:10:23,264
"Sir?" "I'm going away--to-morrow morning by the

1078
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:24,553
first train.

1079
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,754
I shall go and stop with Mr. Todd in the country."

1080
01:10:27,754 --> 01:10:31,473
"Do you wish me to accompany you, sir?" "No."

1081
01:10:31,473 --> 01:10:33,664
"Very good, sir."

1082
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:37,164
"I don't know when I shall be back. Forward my letters."

1083
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:41,043
"Yes, sir." As a matter of fact, I was back within the

1084
01:10:41,043 --> 01:10:42,203
week.

1085
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:48,183
Rocky Todd, the pal I went to stay with, is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone

1086
01:10:48,183 --> 01:10:53,203
in the wilds of Long Island, and likes it; but a little of that sort of thing goes a

1087
01:10:53,203 --> 01:10:54,983
long way with me.

1088
01:10:54,983 --> 01:10:59,914
Dear old Rocky is one of the best, but after a few days in his cottage in the

1089
01:10:59,914 --> 01:11:05,803
woods, miles away from anywhere, New York, even with Motty on the premises, began to

1090
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,014
look pretty good to me.

1091
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:12,193
The days down on Long Island have forty- eight hours in them; you can't get to sleep

1092
01:11:12,193 --> 01:11:16,463
at night because of the bellowing of the crickets; and you have to walk two miles

1093
01:11:16,463 --> 01:11:19,624
for a drink and six for an evening paper.

1094
01:11:19,624 --> 01:11:24,374
I thanked Rocky for his kind hospitality, and caught the only train they have down in

1095
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:28,514
those parts. It landed me in New York about dinner-time.

1096
01:11:28,514 --> 01:11:30,874
I went straight to the old flat.

1097
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:36,603
Jeeves came out of his lair. I looked round cautiously for Rollo.

1098
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:40,213
"Where's that dog, Jeeves? Have you got him tied up?"

1099
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,713
"The animal is no longer here, sir.

1100
01:11:42,713 --> 01:11:46,333
His lordship gave him to the porter, who sold him.

1101
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:51,173
His lordship took a prejudice against the animal on account of being bitten by him in

1102
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,124
the calf of the leg."

1103
01:11:53,124 --> 01:11:56,823
I don't think I've ever been so bucked by a bit of news.

1104
01:11:56,823 --> 01:12:01,463
I felt I had misjudged Rollo. Evidently, when you got to know him better,

1105
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:04,303
he had a lot of intelligence in him.

1106
01:12:04,303 --> 01:12:05,884
"Ripping!" I said.

1107
01:12:05,884 --> 01:12:10,014
"Is Lord Pershore in, Jeeves?" "No, sir."

1108
01:12:10,014 --> 01:12:12,134
"Do you expect him back to dinner?"

1109
01:12:12,134 --> 01:12:15,983
"No, sir." "Where is he?"

1110
01:12:15,983 --> 01:12:22,073
"In prison, sir." Have you ever trodden on a rake and had the

1111
01:12:22,073 --> 01:12:24,073
handle jump up and hit you?

1112
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:27,823
That's how I felt then. "In prison!"

1113
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:32,563
"Yes, sir." "You don't mean--in prison?"

1114
01:12:32,563 --> 01:12:34,624
"Yes, sir."

1115
01:12:34,624 --> 01:12:38,404
I lowered myself into a chair. "Why?"

1116
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:42,994
I said. "He assaulted a constable, sir."

1117
01:12:42,994 --> 01:12:46,353
"Lord Pershore assaulted a constable!"

1118
01:12:46,353 --> 01:12:51,553
"Yes, sir." I digested this.

1119
01:12:51,553 --> 01:12:54,543
"But, Jeeves, I say! This is frightful!"

1120
01:12:54,543 --> 01:12:56,483
"Sir?"

1121
01:12:56,483 --> 01:12:58,664
"What will Lady Malvern say when she finds out?"

1122
01:12:58,664 --> 01:13:04,014
"I do not fancy that her ladyship will find out, sir."

1123
01:13:04,014 --> 01:13:07,384
"But she'll come back and want to know where he is."

1124
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:12,843
"I rather fancy, sir, that his lordship's bit of time will have run out by then."

1125
01:13:12,843 --> 01:13:15,293
"But supposing it hasn't?"

1126
01:13:15,293 --> 01:13:21,423
"In that event, sir, it may be judicious to prevaricate a little."

1127
01:13:21,423 --> 01:13:22,723
"How?"

1128
01:13:22,723 --> 01:13:27,193
"If I might make the suggestion, sir, I should inform her ladyship that his

1129
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:30,624
lordship has left for a short visit to Boston."

1130
01:13:30,624 --> 01:13:31,914
"Why Boston?"

1131
01:13:31,914 --> 01:13:36,514
"Very interesting and respectable centre, sir."

1132
01:13:36,514 --> 01:13:41,833
"Jeeves, I believe you've hit it." "I fancy so, sir."

1133
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:45,193
"Why, this is really the best thing that could have happened.

1134
01:13:45,193 --> 01:13:49,163
If this hadn't turned up to prevent him, young Motty would have been in a sanatorium

1135
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,793
by the time Lady Malvern got back."

1136
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:57,053
"Exactly, sir." The more I looked at it in that way, the

1137
01:13:57,053 --> 01:14:02,254
sounder this prison wheeze seemed to me. There was no doubt in the world that prison

1138
01:14:02,254 --> 01:14:05,514
was just what the doctor ordered for Motty.

1139
01:14:05,514 --> 01:14:08,923
It was the only thing that could have pulled him up.

1140
01:14:08,923 --> 01:14:14,423
I was sorry for the poor blighter, but, after all, I reflected, a chappie who had

1141
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:19,173
lived all his life with Lady Malvern, in a small village in the interior of

1142
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:24,723
Shropshire, wouldn't have much to kick at in a prison.

1143
01:14:24,723 --> 01:14:28,004
Altogether, I began to feel absolutely braced again.

1144
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:33,583
Life became like what the poet Johnnie says--one grand, sweet song.

1145
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:37,774
Things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that I

1146
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:42,553
give you my word that I'd almost forgotten such a person as Motty existed.

1147
01:14:42,553 --> 01:14:48,173
The only flaw in the scheme of things was that Jeeves was still pained and distant.

1148
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:52,843
It wasn't anything he said or did, mind you, but there was a rummy something about

1149
01:14:52,843 --> 01:14:54,803
him all the time.

1150
01:14:54,803 --> 01:14:59,744
Once when I was tying the pink tie I caught sight of him in the looking-glass.

1151
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:03,663
There was a kind of grieved look in his eye.

1152
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:08,563
And then Lady Malvern came back, a good bit ahead of schedule.

1153
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:13,904
I hadn't been expecting her for days. I'd forgotten how time had been slipping

1154
01:15:13,904 --> 01:15:15,154
along.

1155
01:15:15,154 --> 01:15:19,803
She turned up one morning while I was still in bed sipping tea and thinking of this and

1156
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:20,583
that.

1157
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:24,504
Jeeves flowed in with the announcement that he had just loosed her into the sitting-

1158
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:28,423
room. I draped a few garments round me and went

1159
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,394
in.

1160
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:35,093
There she was, sitting in the same arm- chair, looking as massive as ever.

1161
01:15:35,093 --> 01:15:39,453
The only difference was that she didn't uncover the teeth, as she had done the

1162
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:41,853
first time.

1163
01:15:41,853 --> 01:15:45,333
"Good morning," I said. "So you've got back, what?"

1164
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,244
"I have got back."

1165
01:15:46,244 --> 01:15:52,894
There was something sort of bleak about her tone, rather as if she had swallowed an

1166
01:15:52,894 --> 01:15:56,813
east wind. This I took to be due to the fact that she

1167
01:15:56,813 --> 01:15:59,284
probably hadn't breakfasted.

1168
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:03,803
It's only after a bit of breakfast that I'm able to regard the world with that sunny

1169
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:07,433
cheeriness which makes a fellow the universal favourite.

1170
01:16:07,433 --> 01:16:12,644
I'm never much of a lad till I've engulfed an egg or two and a beaker of coffee.

1171
01:16:12,644 --> 01:16:16,943
"I suppose you haven't breakfasted?" "I have not yet breakfasted."

1172
01:16:16,943 --> 01:16:20,543
"Won't you have an egg or something?

1173
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:23,254
Or a sausage or something? Or something?"

1174
01:16:23,254 --> 01:16:25,933
"No, thank you."

1175
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:30,353
She spoke as if she belonged to an anti- sausage society or a league for the

1176
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:36,524
suppression of eggs. There was a bit of a silence.

1177
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:40,923
"I called on you last night," she said, "but you were out."

1178
01:16:40,923 --> 01:16:44,043
"Awfully sorry! Had a pleasant trip?"

1179
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:47,113
"Extremely, thank you."

1180
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:50,124
"See everything? Niag'ra Falls, Yellowstone Park, and the

1181
01:16:50,124 --> 01:16:53,943
jolly old Grand Canyon, and what-not?" "I saw a great deal."

1182
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:59,444
There was another slightly frappe silence.

1183
01:16:59,444 --> 01:17:04,884
Jeeves floated silently into the dining- room and began to lay the breakfast-table.

1184
01:17:04,884 --> 01:17:07,364
"I hope Wilmot was not in your way, Mr. Wooster?"

1185
01:17:07,364 --> 01:17:13,314
I had been wondering when she was going to mention Motty.

1186
01:17:13,314 --> 01:17:14,804
"Rather not! Great pals!

1187
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:17,684
Hit it off splendidly."

1188
01:17:17,684 --> 01:17:21,494
"You were his constant companion, then?" "Absolutely!

1189
01:17:21,494 --> 01:17:25,704
We were always together. Saw all the sights, don't you know.

1190
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:29,834
We'd take in the Museum of Art in the morning, and have a bit of lunch at some

1191
01:17:29,834 --> 01:17:35,274
good vegetarian place, and then toddle along to a sacred concert in the afternoon,

1192
01:17:35,274 --> 01:17:37,364
and home to an early dinner.

1193
01:17:37,364 --> 01:17:41,934
We usually played dominoes after dinner. And then the early bed and the refreshing

1194
01:17:41,934 --> 01:17:44,654
sleep. We had a great time.

1195
01:17:44,654 --> 01:17:48,124
I was awfully sorry when he went away to Boston."

1196
01:17:48,124 --> 01:17:50,874
"Oh! Wilmot is in Boston?"

1197
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:51,694
"Yes.

1198
01:17:51,694 --> 01:17:55,104
I ought to have let you know, but of course we didn't know where you were.

1199
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:59,614
You were dodging all over the place like a snipe--I mean, don't you know, dodging all

1200
01:17:59,614 --> 01:18:02,084
over the place, and we couldn't get at you.

1201
01:18:02,084 --> 01:18:07,624
Yes, Motty went off to Boston." "You're sure he went to Boston?"

1202
01:18:07,624 --> 01:18:09,294
"Oh, absolutely."

1203
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:13,614
I called out to Jeeves, who was now messing about in the next room with forks and so

1204
01:18:13,614 --> 01:18:19,444
forth: "Jeeves, Lord Pershore didn't change his mind about going to Boston, did he?"

1205
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,044
"No, sir."

1206
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:23,894
"I thought I was right. Yes, Motty went to Boston."

1207
01:18:23,894 --> 01:18:30,004
"Then how do you account, Mr. Wooster, for the fact that when I went yesterday

1208
01:18:30,004 --> 01:18:36,374
afternoon to Blackwell's Island prison, to secure material for my book, I saw poor,

1209
01:18:36,374 --> 01:18:38,904
dear Wilmot there, dressed in a striped

1210
01:18:38,904 --> 01:18:43,034
suit, seated beside a pile of stones with a hammer in his hands?"

1211
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:49,844
I tried to think of something to say, but nothing came.

1212
01:18:49,844 --> 01:18:54,154
A chappie has to be a lot broader about the forehead than I am to handle a jolt like

1213
01:18:54,154 --> 01:18:55,694
this.

1214
01:18:55,694 --> 01:19:00,524
I strained the old bean till it creaked, but between the collar and the hair parting

1215
01:19:00,524 --> 01:19:03,964
nothing stirred. I was dumb.

1216
01:19:03,964 --> 01:19:07,704
Which was lucky, because I wouldn't have had a chance to get any persiflage out of

1217
01:19:07,704 --> 01:19:11,774
my system. Lady Malvern collared the conversation.

1218
01:19:11,774 --> 01:19:15,814
She had been bottling it up, and now it came out with a rush:

1219
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:20,194
"So this is how you have looked after my poor, dear boy, Mr. Wooster!

1220
01:19:20,194 --> 01:19:22,914
So this is how you have abused my trust!

1221
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:28,374
I left him in your charge, thinking that I could rely on you to shield him from evil.

1222
01:19:28,374 --> 01:19:33,834
He came to you innocent, unversed in the ways of the world, confiding, unused to the

1223
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:38,704
temptations of a large city, and you led him astray!"

1224
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:41,134
I hadn't any remarks to make.

1225
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:45,294
All I could think of was the picture of Aunt Agatha drinking all this in and

1226
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:48,184
reaching out to sharpen the hatchet against my return.

1227
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:50,594
"You deliberately----"

1228
01:19:50,594 --> 01:19:55,324
Far away in the misty distance a soft voice spoke:

1229
01:19:55,324 --> 01:20:01,674
"If I might explain, your ladyship." Jeeves had projected himself in from the

1230
01:20:01,674 --> 01:20:03,674
dining-room and materialized on the rug.

1231
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:09,774
Lady Malvern tried to freeze him with a look, but you can't do that sort of thing

1232
01:20:09,774 --> 01:20:12,644
to Jeeves. He is look-proof.

1233
01:20:12,644 --> 01:20:17,604
"I fancy, your ladyship, that you have misunderstood Mr. Wooster, and that he may

1234
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:23,144
have given you the impression that he was in New York when his lordship--was removed.

1235
01:20:23,144 --> 01:20:28,204
When Mr. Wooster informed your ladyship that his lordship had gone to Boston, he

1236
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:32,784
was relying on the version I had given him of his lordship's movements.

1237
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:37,744
Mr. Wooster was away, visiting a friend in the country, at the time, and knew nothing

1238
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:41,844
of the matter till your ladyship informed him."

1239
01:20:41,844 --> 01:20:44,274
Lady Malvern gave a kind of grunt.

1240
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:45,934
It didn't rattle Jeeves.

1241
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:52,154
"I feared Mr. Wooster might be disturbed if he knew the truth, as he is so attached to

1242
01:20:52,154 --> 01:20:57,584
his lordship and has taken such pains to look after him, so I took the liberty of

1243
01:20:57,584 --> 01:21:00,934
telling him that his lordship had gone away for a visit.

1244
01:21:00,934 --> 01:21:04,664
It might have been hard for Mr. Wooster to believe that his lordship had gone to

1245
01:21:04,664 --> 01:21:10,134
prison voluntarily and from the best motives, but your ladyship, knowing him

1246
01:21:10,134 --> 01:21:14,844
better, will readily understand."

1247
01:21:14,844 --> 01:21:17,574
"What!" Lady Malvern goggled at him.

1248
01:21:17,574 --> 01:21:22,244
"Did you say that Lord Pershore went to prison voluntarily?"

1249
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,854
"If I might explain, your ladyship.

1250
01:21:23,854 --> 01:21:29,304
I think that your ladyship's parting words made a deep impression on his lordship.

1251
01:21:29,304 --> 01:21:33,814
I have frequently heard him speak to Mr. Wooster of his desire to do something to

1252
01:21:33,814 --> 01:21:38,334
follow your ladyship's instructions and collect material for your ladyship's book

1253
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:39,994
on America.

1254
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:44,494
Mr. Wooster will bear me out when I say that his lordship was frequently extremely

1255
01:21:44,494 --> 01:21:50,154
depressed at the thought that he was doing so little to help."

1256
01:21:50,154 --> 01:21:50,874
"Absolutely, by Jove!

1257
01:21:50,874 --> 01:21:53,814
Quite pipped about it!" I said.

1258
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:58,484
"The idea of making a personal examination into the prison system of the country--from

1259
01:21:58,484 --> 01:22:02,664
within--occurred to his lordship very suddenly one night.

1260
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:04,684
He embraced it eagerly.

1261
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:11,294
There was no restraining him." Lady Malvern looked at Jeeves, then at me,

1262
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:17,224
then at Jeeves again. I could see her struggling with the thing.

1263
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:21,734
"Surely, your ladyship," said Jeeves, "it is more reasonable to suppose that a

1264
01:22:21,734 --> 01:22:26,374
gentleman of his lordship's character went to prison of his own volition than that he

1265
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,674
committed some breach of the law which necessitated his arrest?"

1266
01:22:29,674 --> 01:22:36,674
Lady Malvern blinked. Then she got up.

1267
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:40,904
"Mr. Wooster," she said, "I apologize.

1268
01:22:40,904 --> 01:22:45,734
I have done you an injustice. I should have known Wilmot better.

1269
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:50,764
I should have had more faith in his pure, fine spirit."

1270
01:22:50,764 --> 01:22:50,924
"Absolutely!"

1271
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:55,194
I said. "Your breakfast is ready, sir," said

1272
01:22:55,194 --> 01:22:59,274
Jeeves. I sat down and dallied in a dazed sort of

1273
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:02,184
way with a poached egg.

1274
01:23:02,184 --> 01:23:05,924
"Jeeves," I said, "you are certainly a life-saver!"

1275
01:23:05,924 --> 01:23:09,074
"Thank you, sir."

1276
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:12,874
"Nothing would have convinced my Aunt Agatha that I hadn't lured that blighter

1277
01:23:12,874 --> 01:23:16,424
into riotous living." "I fancy you are right, sir."

1278
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:20,284
I champed my egg for a bit.

1279
01:23:20,284 --> 01:23:25,484
I was most awfully moved, don't you know, by the way Jeeves had rallied round.

1280
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:30,604
Something seemed to tell me that this was an occasion that called for rich rewards.

1281
01:23:30,604 --> 01:23:32,574
For a moment I hesitated.

1282
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:36,124
Then I made up my mind. "Jeeves!"

1283
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:39,714
"Sir?" "That pink tie!"

1284
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:40,004
"Yes, sir?"

1285
01:23:40,004 --> 01:23:45,114
"Burn it!" "Thank you, sir."

1286
01:23:45,114 --> 01:23:48,514
"And, Jeeves!" "Yes, sir?"

1287
01:23:48,514 --> 01:23:53,894
"Take a taxi and get me that Longacre hat, as worn by John Drew!"

1288
01:23:53,894 --> 01:24:00,064
"Thank you very much, sir." I felt most awfully braced.

1289
01:24:00,064 --> 01:24:05,474
I felt as if the clouds had rolled away and all was as it used to be.

1290
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:09,154
I felt like one of those chappies in the novels who calls off the fight with his

1291
01:24:09,154 --> 01:24:13,274
wife in the last chapter and decides to forget and forgive.

1292
01:24:13,274 --> 01:24:17,924
I felt I wanted to do all sorts of other things to show Jeeves that I appreciated

1293
01:24:17,924 --> 01:24:23,144
him. "Jeeves," I said, "it isn't enough.

1294
01:24:23,144 --> 01:24:26,194
Is there anything else you would like?"

1295
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:30,094
"Yes, sir. If I may make the suggestion--fifty

1296
01:24:30,094 --> 01:24:32,674
dollars." "Fifty dollars?"

1297
01:24:32,674 --> 01:24:35,724
"It will enable me to pay a debt of honour, sir.

1298
01:24:35,724 --> 01:24:41,794
I owe it to his lordship." "You owe Lord Pershore fifty dollars?"

1299
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:43,274
"Yes, sir.

1300
01:24:43,274 --> 01:24:47,524
I happened to meet him in the street the night his lordship was arrested.

1301
01:24:47,524 --> 01:24:51,544
I had been thinking a good deal about the most suitable method of inducing him to

1302
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:54,214
abandon his mode of living, sir.

1303
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:59,424
His lordship was a little over-excited at the time and I fancy that he mistook me for

1304
01:24:59,424 --> 01:25:01,474
a friend of his.

1305
01:25:01,474 --> 01:25:06,044
At any rate when I took the liberty of wagering him fifty dollars that he would

1306
01:25:06,044 --> 01:25:11,534
not punch a passing policeman in the eye, he accepted the bet very cordially and won

1307
01:25:11,534 --> 01:25:13,354
it."

1308
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:17,374
I produced my pocket-book and counted out a hundred.

1309
01:25:17,374 --> 01:25:20,024
"Take this, Jeeves," I said; "fifty isn't enough.

1310
01:25:20,024 --> 01:25:26,934
Do you know, Jeeves, you're--well, you absolutely stand alone!"

1311
01:25:26,934 --> 01:25:36,432
"I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir," said Jeeves.

1312
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:37,432
>

1313
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:48,612
CHAPTER 3 JEEVES AND THE HARD-BOILED EGG

1314
01:25:48,612 --> 01:25:53,382
Sometimes of a morning, as I've sat in bed sucking down the early cup of tea and

1315
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:57,591
watched my man Jeeves flitting about the room and putting out the raiment for the

1316
01:25:57,591 --> 01:26:00,271
day, I've wondered what the deuce I should

1317
01:26:00,271 --> 01:26:04,062
do if the fellow ever took it into his head to leave me.

1318
01:26:04,062 --> 01:26:10,202
It's not so bad now I'm in New York, but in London the anxiety was frightful.

1319
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:14,452
There used to be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneak him away

1320
01:26:14,452 --> 01:26:15,592
from me.

1321
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:19,732
Young Reggie Foljambe to my certain knowledge offered him double what I was

1322
01:26:19,732 --> 01:26:24,442
giving him, and Alistair Bingham-Reeves, who's got a valet who had been known to

1323
01:26:24,442 --> 01:26:27,232
press his trousers sideways, used to look

1324
01:26:27,232 --> 01:26:32,192
at him, when he came to see me, with a kind of glittering hungry eye which disturbed me

1325
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:36,192
deucedly. Bally pirates!

1326
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:40,122
The thing, you see, is that Jeeves is so dashed competent.

1327
01:26:40,122 --> 01:26:44,932
You can spot it even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt.

1328
01:26:44,932 --> 01:26:51,182
I rely on him absolutely in every crisis, and he never lets me down.

1329
01:26:51,182 --> 01:26:56,602
And, what's more, he can always be counted on to extend himself on behalf of any pal

1330
01:26:56,602 --> 01:27:02,312
of mine who happens to be to all appearances knee-deep in the bouillon.

1331
01:27:02,312 --> 01:27:07,072
Take the rather rummy case, for instance, of dear old Bicky and his uncle, the hard-

1332
01:27:07,072 --> 01:27:10,922
boiled egg. It happened after I had been in America for

1333
01:27:10,922 --> 01:27:12,382
a few months.

1334
01:27:12,382 --> 01:27:17,161
I got back to the flat latish one night, and when Jeeves brought me the final drink

1335
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:20,892
he said: "Mr. Bickersteth called to see you this

1336
01:27:20,892 --> 01:27:23,602
evening, sir, while you were out."

1337
01:27:23,602 --> 01:27:25,132
"Oh?" I said.

1338
01:27:25,132 --> 01:27:30,242
"Twice, sir. He appeared a trifle agitated."

1339
01:27:30,242 --> 01:27:31,832
"What, pipped?"

1340
01:27:31,832 --> 01:27:36,772
"He gave that impression, sir." I sipped the whisky.

1341
01:27:36,772 --> 01:27:42,182
I was sorry if Bicky was in trouble, but, as a matter of fact, I was rather glad to

1342
01:27:42,182 --> 01:27:46,361
have something I could discuss freely with Jeeves just then, because things had been a

1343
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:49,302
bit strained between us for some time, and

1344
01:27:49,302 --> 01:27:52,712
it had been rather difficult to hit on anything to talk about that wasn't apt to

1345
01:27:52,712 --> 01:27:54,832
take a personal turn.

1346
01:27:54,832 --> 01:28:00,972
You see, I had decided--rightly or wrongly- -to grow a moustache and this had cut

1347
01:28:00,972 --> 01:28:02,632
Jeeves to the quick.

1348
01:28:02,632 --> 01:28:07,242
He couldn't stick the thing at any price, and I had been living ever since in an

1349
01:28:07,242 --> 01:28:12,352
atmosphere of bally disapproval till I was getting jolly well fed up with it.

1350
01:28:12,352 --> 01:28:17,072
What I mean is, while there's no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeves's

1351
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:21,531
judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed, it seemed to me that it was

1352
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:26,682
getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume.

1353
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:31,812
No one can call me an unreasonable chappie, and many's the time I've given in like a

1354
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:36,702
lamb when Jeeves has voted against one of my pet suits or ties; but when it comes to

1355
01:28:36,702 --> 01:28:39,092
a valet's staking out a claim on your upper

1356
01:28:39,092 --> 01:28:43,432
lip you've simply got to have a bit of the good old bulldog pluck and defy the

1357
01:28:43,432 --> 01:28:48,152
blighter. "He said that he would call again later,

1358
01:28:48,152 --> 01:28:49,552
sir."

1359
01:28:49,552 --> 01:28:53,802
"Something must be up, Jeeves." "Yes, sir."

1360
01:28:53,802 --> 01:28:59,512
I gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl. It seemed to hurt Jeeves a good deal, so I

1361
01:28:59,512 --> 01:29:00,802
chucked it.

1362
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:05,242
"I see by the paper, sir, that Mr. Bickersteth's uncle is arriving on the

1363
01:29:05,242 --> 01:29:08,232
Carmantic." "Yes?"

1364
01:29:08,232 --> 01:29:11,882
"His Grace the Duke of Chiswick, sir."

1365
01:29:11,882 --> 01:29:15,201
This was news to me, that Bicky's uncle was a duke.

1366
01:29:15,201 --> 01:29:18,932
Rum, how little one knows about one's pals!

1367
01:29:18,932 --> 01:29:23,572
I had met Bicky for the first time at a species of beano or jamboree down in

1368
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:27,662
Washington Square, not long after my arrival in New York.

1369
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:32,522
I suppose I was a bit homesick at the time, and I rather took to Bicky when I found

1370
01:29:32,522 --> 01:29:37,692
that he was an Englishman and had, in fact, been up at Oxford with me.

1371
01:29:37,692 --> 01:29:42,822
Besides, he was a frightful chump, so we naturally drifted together; and while we

1372
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:46,942
were taking a quiet snort in a corner that wasn't all cluttered up with artists and

1373
01:29:46,942 --> 01:29:49,311
sculptors and what-not, he furthermore

1374
01:29:49,311 --> 01:29:53,481
endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarily gifted imitation of a bull-

1375
01:29:53,481 --> 01:29:55,601
terrier chasing a cat up a tree.

1376
01:29:55,601 --> 01:30:02,082
But, though we had subsequently become extremely pally, all I really knew about

1377
01:30:02,082 --> 01:30:07,282
him was that he was generally hard up, and had an uncle who relieved the strain a bit

1378
01:30:07,282 --> 01:30:10,512
from time to time by sending him monthly remittances.

1379
01:30:10,512 --> 01:30:17,262
"If the Duke of Chiswick is his uncle," I said, "why hasn't he a title?

1380
01:30:17,262 --> 01:30:20,612
Why isn't he Lord What-Not?"

1381
01:30:20,612 --> 01:30:25,612
"Mr. Bickersteth is the son of his grace's late sister, sir, who married Captain Rollo

1382
01:30:25,612 --> 01:30:31,571
Bickersteth of the Coldstream Guards." Jeeves knows everything.

1383
01:30:31,571 --> 01:30:34,772
"Is Mr. Bickersteth's father dead, too?"

1384
01:30:34,772 --> 01:30:37,321
"Yes, sir." "Leave any money?"

1385
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:43,122
"No, sir." I began to understand why poor old Bicky

1386
01:30:43,122 --> 01:30:46,062
was always more or less on the rocks.

1387
01:30:46,062 --> 01:30:50,932
To the casual and irreflective observer, if you know what I mean, it may sound a pretty

1388
01:30:50,932 --> 01:30:55,772
good wheeze having a duke for an uncle, but the trouble about old Chiswick was that,

1389
01:30:55,772 --> 01:30:58,402
though an extremely wealthy old buster,

1390
01:30:58,402 --> 01:31:03,292
owning half London and about five counties up north, he was notoriously the most

1391
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:08,661
prudent spender in England. He was what American chappies would call a

1392
01:31:08,661 --> 01:31:11,672
hard-boiled egg.

1393
01:31:11,672 --> 01:31:15,392
If Bicky's people hadn't left him anything and he depended on what he could prise out

1394
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:18,932
of the old duke, he was in a pretty bad way.

1395
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:22,932
Not that that explained why he was hunting me like this, because he was a chap who

1396
01:31:22,932 --> 01:31:27,691
never borrowed money. He said he wanted to keep his pals, so

1397
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:31,202
never bit any one's ear on principle.

1398
01:31:31,202 --> 01:31:36,742
At this juncture the door bell rang. Jeeves floated out to answer it.

1399
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:40,441
"Yes, sir. Mr. Wooster has just returned," I heard him

1400
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:41,522
say.

1401
01:31:41,522 --> 01:31:46,411
And Bicky came trickling in, looking pretty sorry for himself.

1402
01:31:46,411 --> 01:31:48,892
"Halloa, Bicky!" I said.

1403
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:51,351
"Jeeves told me you had been trying to get me.

1404
01:31:51,351 --> 01:31:54,862
Jeeves, bring another glass, and let the revels commence.

1405
01:31:54,862 --> 01:31:57,631
What's the trouble, Bicky?"

1406
01:31:57,631 --> 01:32:01,002
"I'm in a hole, Bertie. I want your advice."

1407
01:32:01,002 --> 01:32:05,552
"Say on, old lad!" "My uncle's turning up to-morrow, Bertie."

1408
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:07,462
"So Jeeves told me."

1409
01:32:07,462 --> 01:32:11,691
"The Duke of Chiswick, you know." "So Jeeves told me."

1410
01:32:11,691 --> 01:32:16,452
Bicky seemed a bit surprised. "Jeeves seems to know everything."

1411
01:32:16,452 --> 01:32:21,522
"Rather rummily, that's exactly what I was thinking just now myself."

1412
01:32:21,522 --> 01:32:26,911
"Well, I wish," said Bicky gloomily, "that he knew a way to get me out of the hole I'm

1413
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:28,282
in."

1414
01:32:28,282 --> 01:32:34,202
Jeeves shimmered in with the glass, and stuck it competently on the table.

1415
01:32:34,202 --> 01:32:38,571
"Mr. Bickersteth is in a bit of a hole, Jeeves," I said, "and wants you to rally

1416
01:32:38,571 --> 01:32:39,821
round."

1417
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:44,532
"Very good, sir." Bicky looked a bit doubtful.

1418
01:32:44,532 --> 01:32:48,952
"Well, of course, you know, Bertie, this thing is by way of being a bit private and

1419
01:32:48,952 --> 01:32:50,242
all that."

1420
01:32:50,242 --> 01:32:55,492
"I shouldn't worry about that, old top. I bet Jeeves knows all about it already.

1421
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:57,471
Don't you, Jeeves?" "Yes, sir."

1422
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:01,772
"Eh!" said Bicky, rattled.

1423
01:33:01,772 --> 01:33:06,691
"I am open to correction, sir, but is not your dilemma due to the fact that you are

1424
01:33:06,691 --> 01:33:12,812
at a loss to explain to his grace why you are in New York instead of in Colorado?"

1425
01:33:12,812 --> 01:33:15,542
Bicky rocked like a jelly in a high wind.

1426
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:18,422
"How the deuce do you know anything about it?"

1427
01:33:18,422 --> 01:33:22,432
"I chanced to meet his grace's butler before we left England.

1428
01:33:22,432 --> 01:33:27,022
He informed me that he happened to overhear his grace speaking to you on the matter,

1429
01:33:27,022 --> 01:33:34,351
sir, as he passed the library door." Bicky gave a hollow sort of laugh.

1430
01:33:34,351 --> 01:33:39,672
"Well, as everybody seems to know all about it, there's no need to try to keep it dark.

1431
01:33:39,672 --> 01:33:45,022
The old boy turfed me out, Bertie, because he said I was a brainless nincompoop.

1432
01:33:45,022 --> 01:33:49,372
The idea was that he would give me a remittance on condition that I dashed out

1433
01:33:49,372 --> 01:33:54,881
to some blighted locality of the name of Colorado and learned farming or ranching,

1434
01:33:54,881 --> 01:34:00,962
or whatever they call it, at some bally ranch or farm or whatever it's called.

1435
01:34:00,962 --> 01:34:05,941
I didn't fancy the idea a bit. I should have had to ride horses and pursue

1436
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:07,501
cows, and so forth.

1437
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:10,321
I hate horses. They bite at you.

1438
01:34:10,321 --> 01:34:15,761
I was all against the scheme. At the same time, don't you know, I had to

1439
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:17,471
have that remittance."

1440
01:34:17,471 --> 01:34:23,871
"I get you absolutely, dear boy." "Well, when I got to New York it looked a

1441
01:34:23,871 --> 01:34:27,941
decent sort of place to me, so I thought it would be a pretty sound notion to stop

1442
01:34:27,941 --> 01:34:28,931
here.

1443
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:33,191
So I cabled to my uncle telling him that I had dropped into a good business wheeze in

1444
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:36,461
the city and wanted to chuck the ranch idea.

1445
01:34:36,461 --> 01:34:41,111
He wrote back that it was all right, and here I've been ever since.

1446
01:34:41,111 --> 01:34:44,482
He thinks I'm doing well at something or other over here.

1447
01:34:44,482 --> 01:34:47,991
I never dreamed, don't you know, that he would ever come out here.

1448
01:34:47,991 --> 01:34:54,222
What on earth am I to do?" "Jeeves," I said, "what on earth is Mr.

1449
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:56,141
Bickersteth to do?"

1450
01:34:56,141 --> 01:35:00,681
"You see," said Bicky, "I had a wireless from him to say that he was coming to stay

1451
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:06,501
with me--to save hotel bills, I suppose. I've always given him the impression that I

1452
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:08,532
was living in pretty good style.

1453
01:35:08,532 --> 01:35:10,711
I can't have him to stay at my boarding- house."

1454
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:15,121
"Thought of anything, Jeeves?" I said.

1455
01:35:15,121 --> 01:35:19,551
"To what extent, sir, if the question is not a delicate one, are you prepared to

1456
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:24,162
assist Mr. Bickersteth?" "I'll do anything I can for you, of course,

1457
01:35:24,162 --> 01:35:25,631
Bicky, old man."

1458
01:35:25,631 --> 01:35:31,792
"Then, if I might make the suggestion, sir, you might lend Mr. Bickersteth----"

1459
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:36,222
"No, by Jove!" said Bicky firmly. "I never have touched you, Bertie, and I'm

1460
01:35:36,222 --> 01:35:38,141
not going to start now.

1461
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:43,751
I may be a chump, but it's my boast that I don't owe a penny to a single soul--not

1462
01:35:43,751 --> 01:35:49,032
counting tradesmen, of course." "I was about to suggest, sir, that you

1463
01:35:49,032 --> 01:35:52,581
might lend Mr. Bickersteth this flat.

1464
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:57,092
Mr. Bickersteth could give his grace the impression that he was the owner of it.

1465
01:35:57,092 --> 01:36:01,241
With your permission I could convey the notion that I was in Mr. Bickersteth's

1466
01:36:01,241 --> 01:36:03,342
employment, and not in yours.

1467
01:36:03,342 --> 01:36:08,171
You would be residing here temporarily as Mr. Bickersteth's guest.

1468
01:36:08,171 --> 01:36:11,371
His grace would occupy the second spare bedroom.

1469
01:36:11,371 --> 01:36:16,402
I fancy that you would find this answer satisfactorily, sir."

1470
01:36:16,402 --> 01:36:22,871
Bicky had stopped rocking himself and was staring at Jeeves in an awed sort of way.

1471
01:36:22,871 --> 01:36:26,801
"I would advocate the dispatching of a wireless message to his grace on board the

1472
01:36:26,801 --> 01:36:30,461
vessel, notifying him of the change of address.

1473
01:36:30,461 --> 01:36:35,602
Mr. Bickersteth could meet his grace at the dock and proceed directly here.

1474
01:36:35,602 --> 01:36:40,421
Will that meet the situation, sir?" "Absolutely."

1475
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:42,311
"Thank you, sir."

1476
01:36:42,311 --> 01:36:47,231
Bicky followed him with his eye till the door closed.

1477
01:36:47,231 --> 01:36:51,542
"How does he do it, Bertie?" he said. "I'll tell you what I think it is.

1478
01:36:51,542 --> 01:36:54,741
I believe it's something to do with the shape of his head.

1479
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:57,352
Have you ever noticed his head, Bertie, old man?

1480
01:36:57,352 --> 01:36:59,771
It sort of sticks out at the back!"

1481
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:04,881
I hopped out of bed early next morning, so as to be among those present when the old

1482
01:37:04,881 --> 01:37:06,551
boy should arrive.

1483
01:37:06,551 --> 01:37:11,241
I knew from experience that these ocean liners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly

1484
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:13,162
ungodly hour.

1485
01:37:13,162 --> 01:37:17,581
It wasn't much after nine by the time I'd dressed and had my morning tea and was

1486
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:22,371
leaning out of the window, watching the street for Bicky and his uncle.

1487
01:37:22,371 --> 01:37:26,391
It was one of those jolly, peaceful mornings that make a chappie wish he'd got

1488
01:37:26,391 --> 01:37:30,731
a soul or something, and I was just brooding on life in general when I became

1489
01:37:30,731 --> 01:37:35,141
aware of the dickens of a spate in progress down below.

1490
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:40,571
A taxi had driven up, and an old boy in a top hat had got out and was kicking up a

1491
01:37:40,571 --> 01:37:43,711
frightful row about the fare.

1492
01:37:43,711 --> 01:37:48,361
As far as I could make out, he was trying to get the cab chappie to switch from New

1493
01:37:48,361 --> 01:37:53,061
York to London prices, and the cab chappie had apparently never heard of London

1494
01:37:53,061 --> 01:37:56,501
before, and didn't seem to think a lot of it now.

1495
01:37:56,501 --> 01:38:01,311
The old boy said that in London the trip would have set him back eightpence; and the

1496
01:38:01,311 --> 01:38:03,121
cabby said he should worry.

1497
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:08,011
I called to Jeeves. "The duke has arrived, Jeeves."

1498
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:12,912
"Yes, sir?" "That'll be him at the door now."

1499
01:38:12,912 --> 01:38:17,662
Jeeves made a long arm and opened the front door, and the old boy crawled in, looking

1500
01:38:17,662 --> 01:38:21,621
licked to a splinter. "How do you do, sir?"

1501
01:38:21,621 --> 01:38:25,592
I said, bustling up and being the ray of sunshine.

1502
01:38:25,592 --> 01:38:29,451
"Your nephew went down to the dock to meet you, but you must have missed him.

1503
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,521
My name's Wooster, don't you know.

1504
01:38:31,521 --> 01:38:34,361
Great pal of Bicky's, and all that sort of thing.

1505
01:38:34,361 --> 01:38:37,741
I'm staying with him, you know. Would you like a cup of tea?

1506
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:40,902
Jeeves, bring a cup of tea."

1507
01:38:40,902 --> 01:38:45,831
Old Chiswick had sunk into an arm-chair and was looking about the room.

1508
01:38:45,831 --> 01:38:49,261
"Does this luxurious flat belong to my nephew Francis?"

1509
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:51,061
"Absolutely."

1510
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:55,451
"It must be terribly expensive." "Pretty well, of course.

1511
01:38:55,451 --> 01:38:58,342
Everything costs a lot over here, you know."

1512
01:38:58,342 --> 01:38:59,771
He moaned.

1513
01:38:59,771 --> 01:39:04,681
Jeeves filtered in with the tea. Old Chiswick took a stab at it to restore

1514
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:08,951
his tissues, and nodded. "A terrible country, Mr. Wooster!

1515
01:39:08,951 --> 01:39:11,081
A terrible country!

1516
01:39:11,081 --> 01:39:14,821
Nearly eight shillings for a short cab- drive!

1517
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:18,402
Iniquitous!" He took another look round the room.

1518
01:39:18,402 --> 01:39:20,571
It seemed to fascinate him.

1519
01:39:20,571 --> 01:39:25,061
"Have you any idea how much my nephew pays for this flat, Mr. Wooster?"

1520
01:39:25,061 --> 01:39:27,912
"About two hundred dollars a month, I believe."

1521
01:39:27,912 --> 01:39:28,701
"What!

1522
01:39:28,701 --> 01:39:34,191
Forty pounds a month!" I began to see that, unless I made the

1523
01:39:34,191 --> 01:39:38,981
thing a bit more plausible, the scheme might turn out a frost.

1524
01:39:38,981 --> 01:39:41,652
I could guess what the old boy was thinking.

1525
01:39:41,652 --> 01:39:47,722
He was trying to square all this prosperity with what he knew of poor old Bicky.

1526
01:39:47,722 --> 01:39:52,331
And one had to admit that it took a lot of squaring, for dear old Bicky, though a

1527
01:39:52,331 --> 01:39:58,342
stout fellow and absolutely unrivalled as an imitator of bull-terriers and cats, was

1528
01:39:58,342 --> 01:40:00,511
in many ways one of the most pronounced

1529
01:40:00,511 --> 01:40:04,842
fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gent's underwear.

1530
01:40:04,842 --> 01:40:09,851
"I suppose it seems rummy to you," I said, "but the fact is New York often bucks

1531
01:40:09,851 --> 01:40:13,851
chappies up and makes them show a flash of speed that you wouldn't have imagined them

1532
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:14,861
capable of.

1533
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:19,251
It sort of develops them. Something in the air, don't you know.

1534
01:40:19,251 --> 01:40:23,601
I imagine that Bicky in the past, when you knew him, may have been something of a

1535
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:26,921
chump, but it's quite different now.

1536
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:31,472
Devilish efficient sort of chappie, and looked on in commercial circles as quite

1537
01:40:31,472 --> 01:40:35,081
the nib!" "I am amazed!

1538
01:40:35,081 --> 01:40:37,711
What is the nature of my nephew's business, Mr. Wooster?"

1539
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:41,871
"Oh, just business, don't you know.

1540
01:40:41,871 --> 01:40:46,051
The same sort of thing Carnegie and Rockefeller and all these coves do, you

1541
01:40:46,051 --> 01:40:48,891
know." I slid for the door.

1542
01:40:48,891 --> 01:40:54,391
"Awfully sorry to leave you, but I've got to meet some of the lads elsewhere."

1543
01:40:54,391 --> 01:40:57,171
Coming out of the lift I met Bicky bustling in from the street.

1544
01:40:57,171 --> 01:40:59,541
"Halloa, Bertie!

1545
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:02,061
I missed him. Has he turned up?"

1546
01:41:02,061 --> 01:41:07,561
"He's upstairs now, having some tea." "What does he think of it all?"

1547
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:11,421
"He's absolutely rattled."

1548
01:41:11,421 --> 01:41:14,171
"Ripping! I'll be toddling up, then.

1549
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:17,092
Toodle-oo, Bertie, old man. See you later."

1550
01:41:17,092 --> 01:41:19,461
"Pip-pip, Bicky, dear boy."

1551
01:41:19,461 --> 01:41:24,782
He trotted off, full of merriment and good cheer, and I went off to the club to sit in

1552
01:41:24,782 --> 01:41:29,111
the window and watch the traffic coming up one way and going down the other.

1553
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:34,731
It was latish in the evening when I looked in at the flat to dress for dinner.

1554
01:41:34,731 --> 01:41:38,592
"Where's everybody, Jeeves?" I said, finding no little feet pattering

1555
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:39,871
about the place.

1556
01:41:39,871 --> 01:41:43,821
"Gone out?" "His grace desired to see some of the

1557
01:41:43,821 --> 01:41:48,671
sights of the city, sir. Mr. Bickersteth is acting as his escort.

1558
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:53,851
I fancy their immediate objective was Grant's Tomb."

1559
01:41:53,851 --> 01:41:58,501
"I suppose Mr. Bickersteth is a bit braced at the way things are going--what?"

1560
01:41:58,501 --> 01:41:59,831
"Sir?"

1561
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:04,951
"I say, I take it that Mr. Bickersteth is tolerably full of beans."

1562
01:42:04,951 --> 01:42:09,951
"Not altogether, sir." "What's his trouble now?"

1563
01:42:09,951 --> 01:42:13,691
"The scheme which I took the liberty of suggesting to Mr. Bickersteth and yourself

1564
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:20,101
has, unfortunately, not answered entirely satisfactorily, sir."

1565
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:23,561
"Surely the duke believes that Mr. Bickersteth is doing well in business, and

1566
01:42:23,561 --> 01:42:26,731
all that sort of thing?" "Exactly, sir.

1567
01:42:26,731 --> 01:42:32,261
With the result that he has decided to cancel Mr. Bickersteth's monthly allowance,

1568
01:42:32,261 --> 01:42:36,891
on the ground that, as Mr. Bickersteth is doing so well on his own account, he no

1569
01:42:36,891 --> 01:42:41,261
longer requires pecuniary assistance."

1570
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:43,841
"Great Scot, Jeeves! This is awful."

1571
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:49,652
"Somewhat disturbing, sir." "I never expected anything like this!"

1572
01:42:49,652 --> 01:42:55,961
"I confess I scarcely anticipated the contingency myself, sir."

1573
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:59,951
"I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?"

1574
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:04,601
"Mr. Bickersteth appeared somewhat taken aback, sir."

1575
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:09,221
My heart bled for Bicky. "We must do something, Jeeves."

1576
01:43:09,221 --> 01:43:11,542
"Yes, sir."

1577
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:15,912
"Can you think of anything?" "Not at the moment, sir."

1578
01:43:15,912 --> 01:43:19,272
"There must be something we can do."

1579
01:43:19,272 --> 01:43:23,882
"It was a maxim of one of my former employers, sir--as I believe I mentioned to

1580
01:43:23,882 --> 01:43:29,402
you once before--the present Lord Bridgnorth, that there is always a way.

1581
01:43:29,402 --> 01:43:35,211
I remember his lordship using the expression on the occasion--he was then a

1582
01:43:35,211 --> 01:43:41,211
business gentleman and had not yet received his title--when a patent hair-restorer

1583
01:43:41,211 --> 01:43:45,282
which he chanced to be promoting failed to attract the public.

1584
01:43:45,282 --> 01:43:50,642
He put it on the market under another name as a depilatory, and amassed a substantial

1585
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:51,812
fortune.

1586
01:43:51,812 --> 01:43:56,941
I have generally found his lordship's aphorism based on sound foundations.

1587
01:43:56,941 --> 01:44:01,912
No doubt we shall be able to discover some solution of Mr. Bickersteth's difficulty,

1588
01:44:01,912 --> 01:44:04,312
sir."

1589
01:44:04,312 --> 01:44:10,461
"Well, have a stab at it, Jeeves!" "I will spare no pains, sir."

1590
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:13,091
I went and dressed sadly.

1591
01:44:13,091 --> 01:44:17,432
It will show you pretty well how pipped I was when I tell you that I near as a

1592
01:44:17,432 --> 01:44:20,571
toucher put on a white tie with a dinner- jacket.

1593
01:44:20,571 --> 01:44:25,122
I sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because I wanted it.

1594
01:44:25,122 --> 01:44:30,052
It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed for the

1595
01:44:30,052 --> 01:44:31,422
breadline.

1596
01:44:31,422 --> 01:44:36,522
When I got back old Chiswick had gone to bed, but Bicky was there, hunched up in an

1597
01:44:36,522 --> 01:44:41,382
arm-chair, brooding pretty tensely, with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his

1598
01:44:41,382 --> 01:44:45,792
mouth and a more or less glassy stare in his eyes.

1599
01:44:45,792 --> 01:44:49,471
He had the aspect of one who had been soaked with what the newspaper chappies

1600
01:44:49,471 --> 01:44:53,512
call "some blunt instrument."

1601
01:44:53,512 --> 01:44:56,851
"This is a bit thick, old thing--what!" I said.

1602
01:44:56,851 --> 01:45:01,062
He picked up his glass and drained it feverishly, overlooking the fact that it

1603
01:45:01,062 --> 01:45:02,711
hadn't anything in it.

1604
01:45:02,711 --> 01:45:07,172
"I'm done, Bertie!" he said. He had another go at the glass.

1605
01:45:07,172 --> 01:45:11,802
It didn't seem to do him any good. "If only this had happened a week later,

1606
01:45:11,802 --> 01:45:12,892
Bertie!

1607
01:45:12,892 --> 01:45:16,252
My next month's money was due to roll in on Saturday.

1608
01:45:16,252 --> 01:45:19,172
I could have worked a wheeze I've been reading about in the magazine

1609
01:45:19,172 --> 01:45:20,522
advertisements.

1610
01:45:20,522 --> 01:45:25,052
It seems that you can make a dashed amount of money if you can only collect a few

1611
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:30,221
dollars and start a chicken-farm. Jolly sound scheme, Bertie!

1612
01:45:30,221 --> 01:45:34,662
Say you buy a hen--call it one hen for the sake of argument.

1613
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:39,162
It lays an egg every day of the week. You sell the eggs seven for twenty-five

1614
01:45:39,162 --> 01:45:40,752
cents.

1615
01:45:40,752 --> 01:45:44,811
Keep of hen costs nothing. Profit practically twenty-five cents on

1616
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:48,861
every seven eggs. Or look at it another way: Suppose you have

1617
01:45:48,861 --> 01:45:50,211
a dozen eggs.

1618
01:45:50,211 --> 01:45:54,302
Each of the hens has a dozen chickens. The chickens grow up and have more

1619
01:45:54,302 --> 01:45:55,481
chickens.

1620
01:45:55,481 --> 01:46:00,341
Why, in no time you'd have the place covered knee-deep in hens, all laying eggs,

1621
01:46:00,341 --> 01:46:04,502
at twenty-five cents for every seven. You'd make a fortune.

1622
01:46:04,502 --> 01:46:06,841
Jolly life, too, keeping hens!"

1623
01:46:06,841 --> 01:46:10,802
He had begun to get quite worked up at the thought of it, but he slopped back in his

1624
01:46:10,802 --> 01:46:14,002
chair at this juncture with a good deal of gloom.

1625
01:46:14,002 --> 01:46:18,892
"But, of course, it's no good," he said, "because I haven't the cash."

1626
01:46:18,892 --> 01:46:24,491
"You've only to say the word, you know, Bicky, old top."

1627
01:46:24,491 --> 01:46:29,581
"Thanks awfully, Bertie, but I'm not going to sponge on you."

1628
01:46:29,581 --> 01:46:31,542
That's always the way in this world.

1629
01:46:31,542 --> 01:46:35,662
The chappies you'd like to lend money to won't let you, whereas the chappies you

1630
01:46:35,662 --> 01:46:40,162
don't want to lend it to will do everything except actually stand you on your head and

1631
01:46:40,162 --> 01:46:42,741
lift the specie out of your pockets.

1632
01:46:42,741 --> 01:46:47,571
As a lad who has always rolled tolerably free in the right stuff, I've had lots of

1633
01:46:47,571 --> 01:46:50,022
experience of the second class.

1634
01:46:50,022 --> 01:46:54,981
Many's the time, back in London, I've hurried along Piccadilly and felt the hot

1635
01:46:54,981 --> 01:46:59,451
breath of the toucher on the back of my neck and heard his sharp, excited yapping

1636
01:46:59,451 --> 01:47:00,991
as he closed in on me.

1637
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:04,971
I've simply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters I didn't care a hang

1638
01:47:04,971 --> 01:47:11,211
for; yet here was I now, dripping doubloons and pieces of eight and longing to hand

1639
01:47:11,211 --> 01:47:19,432
them over, and Bicky, poor fish, absolutely on his uppers, not taking any at any price.

1640
01:47:19,432 --> 01:47:23,272
"Well, there's only one hope, then." "What's that?"

1641
01:47:23,272 --> 01:47:24,372
"Jeeves."

1642
01:47:24,372 --> 01:47:28,922
"Sir?" There was Jeeves, standing behind me, full

1643
01:47:28,922 --> 01:47:32,892
of zeal. In this matter of shimmering into rooms the

1644
01:47:32,892 --> 01:47:35,392
chappie is rummy to a degree.

1645
01:47:35,392 --> 01:47:39,721
You're sitting in the old armchair, thinking of this and that, and then

1646
01:47:39,721 --> 01:47:44,821
suddenly you look up, and there he is. He moves from point to point with as little

1647
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:46,932
uproar as a jelly fish.

1648
01:47:46,932 --> 01:47:50,672
The thing startled poor old Bicky considerably.

1649
01:47:50,672 --> 01:47:54,262
He rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant.

1650
01:47:54,262 --> 01:47:59,762
I'm used to Jeeves now, but often in the days when he first came to me I've bitten

1651
01:47:59,762 --> 01:48:03,032
my tongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst.

1652
01:48:03,032 --> 01:48:06,262
"Did you call, sir?"

1653
01:48:06,262 --> 01:48:10,201
"Oh, there you are, Jeeves!" "Precisely, sir."

1654
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:14,182
"Jeeves, Mr. Bickersteth is still up the pole.

1655
01:48:14,182 --> 01:48:16,142
Any ideas?"

1656
01:48:16,142 --> 01:48:20,302
"Why, yes, sir. Since we had our recent conversation I

1657
01:48:20,302 --> 01:48:23,642
fancy I have found what may prove a solution.

1658
01:48:23,642 --> 01:48:28,142
I do not wish to appear to be taking a liberty, sir, but I think that we have

1659
01:48:28,142 --> 01:48:33,272
overlooked his grace's potentialities as a source of revenue."

1660
01:48:33,272 --> 01:48:38,201
Bicky laughed, what I have sometimes seen described as a hollow, mocking laugh, a

1661
01:48:38,201 --> 01:48:43,991
sort of bitter cackle from the back of the throat, rather like a gargle.

1662
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:48,971
"I do not allude, sir," explained Jeeves, "to the possibility of inducing his grace

1663
01:48:48,971 --> 01:48:50,532
to part with money.

1664
01:48:50,532 --> 01:48:55,711
I am taking the liberty of regarding his grace in the light of an at present--if I

1665
01:48:55,711 --> 01:49:02,372
may say so--useless property, which is capable of being developed."

1666
01:49:02,372 --> 01:49:05,691
Bicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way.

1667
01:49:05,691 --> 01:49:10,471
I'm bound to say I didn't get it myself. "Couldn't you make it a bit easier,

1668
01:49:10,471 --> 01:49:11,752
Jeeves!"

1669
01:49:11,752 --> 01:49:18,681
"In a nutshell, sir, what I mean is this: His grace is, in a sense, a prominent

1670
01:49:18,681 --> 01:49:19,721
personage.

1671
01:49:19,721 --> 01:49:24,951
The inhabitants of this country, as no doubt you are aware, sir, are peculiarly

1672
01:49:24,951 --> 01:49:28,772
addicted to shaking hands with prominent personages.

1673
01:49:28,772 --> 01:49:33,892
It occurred to me that Mr. Bickersteth or yourself might know of persons who would be

1674
01:49:33,892 --> 01:49:39,341
willing to pay a small fee--let us say two dollars or three--for the privilege of an

1675
01:49:39,341 --> 01:49:44,542
introduction, including handshake, to his grace."

1676
01:49:44,542 --> 01:49:47,481
Bicky didn't seem to think much of it.

1677
01:49:47,481 --> 01:49:52,181
"Do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid cash just to

1678
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:53,561
shake hands with my uncle?"

1679
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:58,981
"I have an aunt, sir, who paid five shillings to a young fellow for bringing a

1680
01:49:58,981 --> 01:50:03,431
moving-picture actor to tea at her house one Sunday.

1681
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:07,571
It gave her social standing among the neighbours."

1682
01:50:07,571 --> 01:50:11,872
Bicky wavered. "If you think it could be done----"

1683
01:50:11,872 --> 01:50:15,681
"I feel convinced of it, sir."

1684
01:50:15,681 --> 01:50:20,752
"What do you think, Bertie?" "I'm for it, old boy, absolutely.

1685
01:50:20,752 --> 01:50:25,081
A very brainy wheeze." "Thank you, sir.

1686
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:26,912
Will there be anything further?

1687
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:31,782
Good night, sir." And he floated out, leaving us to discuss

1688
01:50:31,782 --> 01:50:35,111
details.

1689
01:50:35,111 --> 01:50:40,181
Until we started this business of floating old Chiswick as a money-making proposition

1690
01:50:40,181 --> 01:50:45,642
I had never realized what a perfectly foul time those Stock Exchange chappies must

1691
01:50:45,642 --> 01:50:48,971
have when the public isn't biting freely.

1692
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:54,091
Nowadays I read that bit they put in the financial reports about "The market opened

1693
01:50:54,091 --> 01:50:59,971
quietly" with a sympathetic eye, for, by Jove, it certainly opened quietly for us!

1694
01:50:59,971 --> 01:51:04,491
You'd hardly believe how difficult it was to interest the public and make them take a

1695
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:06,711
flutter on the old boy.

1696
01:51:06,711 --> 01:51:12,071
By the end of the week the only name we had on our list was a delicatessen-store keeper

1697
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:16,652
down in Bicky's part of the town, and as he wanted us to take it out in sliced ham

1698
01:51:16,652 --> 01:51:19,991
instead of cash that didn't help much.

1699
01:51:19,991 --> 01:51:24,552
There was a gleam of light when the brother of Bicky's pawnbroker offered ten dollars,

1700
01:51:24,552 --> 01:51:30,081
money down, for an introduction to old Chiswick, but the deal fell through, owing

1701
01:51:30,081 --> 01:51:32,292
to its turning out that the chap was an

1702
01:51:32,292 --> 01:51:37,221
anarchist and intended to kick the old boy instead of shaking hands with him.

1703
01:51:37,221 --> 01:51:42,611
At that, it took me the deuce of a time to persuade Bicky not to grab the cash and let

1704
01:51:42,611 --> 01:51:44,632
things take their course.

1705
01:51:44,632 --> 01:51:48,272
He seemed to regard the pawnbroker's brother rather as a sportsman and

1706
01:51:48,272 --> 01:51:51,552
benefactor of his species than otherwise.

1707
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:55,642
The whole thing, I'm inclined to think, would have been off if it hadn't been for

1708
01:51:55,642 --> 01:51:59,372
Jeeves. There is no doubt that Jeeves is in a class

1709
01:51:59,372 --> 01:52:00,721
of his own.

1710
01:52:00,721 --> 01:52:05,111
In the matter of brain and resource I don't think I have ever met a chappie so

1711
01:52:05,111 --> 01:52:07,922
supremely like mother made.

1712
01:52:07,922 --> 01:52:12,361
He trickled into my room one morning with a good old cup of tea, and intimated that

1713
01:52:12,361 --> 01:52:17,172
there was something doing. "Might I speak to you with regard to that

1714
01:52:17,172 --> 01:52:18,262
matter of his grace, sir?"

1715
01:52:18,262 --> 01:52:22,491
"It's all off. We've decided to chuck it."

1716
01:52:22,491 --> 01:52:25,201
"Sir?" "It won't work.

1717
01:52:25,201 --> 01:52:28,311
We can't get anybody to come."

1718
01:52:28,311 --> 01:52:31,032
"I fancy I can arrange that aspect of the matter, sir."

1719
01:52:31,032 --> 01:52:36,262
"Do you mean to say you've managed to get anybody?"

1720
01:52:36,262 --> 01:52:37,931
"Yes, sir.

1721
01:52:37,931 --> 01:52:40,821
Eighty-seven gentlemen from Birdsburg, sir."

1722
01:52:40,821 --> 01:52:45,841
I sat up in bed and spilt the tea. "Birdsburg?"

1723
01:52:45,841 --> 01:52:46,861
"Birdsburg, Missouri, sir."

1724
01:52:46,861 --> 01:52:48,841
"How did you get them?"

1725
01:52:48,841 --> 01:52:54,321
"I happened last night, sir, as you had intimated that you would be absent from

1726
01:52:54,321 --> 01:52:59,941
home, to attend a theatrical performance, and entered into conversation between the

1727
01:52:59,941 --> 01:53:03,422
acts with the occupant of the adjoining seat.

1728
01:53:03,422 --> 01:53:07,122
I had observed that he was wearing a somewhat ornate decoration in his

1729
01:53:07,122 --> 01:53:12,601
buttonhole, sir--a large blue button with the words 'Boost for Birdsburg' upon it in

1730
01:53:12,601 --> 01:53:17,831
red letters, scarcely a judicious addition to a gentleman's evening costume.

1731
01:53:17,831 --> 01:53:22,301
To my surprise I noticed that the auditorium was full of persons similarly

1732
01:53:22,301 --> 01:53:23,762
decorated.

1733
01:53:23,762 --> 01:53:28,792
I ventured to inquire the explanation, and was informed that these gentlemen, forming

1734
01:53:28,792 --> 01:53:44,422
a party of eighty-seven, are a convention from a town of the name if Birdsburg,

1735
01:53:44,422 --> 01:53:46,551
in the State of Missouri.

1736
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:51,601
Their visit, I gathered, was purely of a social and pleasurable nature, and my

1737
01:53:51,601 --> 01:53:55,741
informant spoke at some length of the entertainments arranged for their stay in

1738
01:53:55,741 --> 01:53:56,902
the city.

1739
01:53:56,902 --> 01:54:02,132
It was when he related with a considerable amount of satisfaction and pride, that a

1740
01:54:02,132 --> 01:54:06,762
deputation of their number had been introduced to and had shaken hands with a

1741
01:54:06,762 --> 01:54:12,191
well-known prizefighter, that it occurred to me to broach the subject of his grace.

1742
01:54:12,191 --> 01:54:17,301
To make a long story short, sir, I have arranged, subject to your approval, that

1743
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:22,542
the entire convention shall be presented to his grace to-morrow afternoon."

1744
01:54:22,542 --> 01:54:23,571
I was amazed.

1745
01:54:23,571 --> 01:54:28,191
This chappie was a Napoleon. "Eighty-seven, Jeeves.

1746
01:54:28,191 --> 01:54:33,172
At how much a head?" "I was obliged to agree to a reduction for

1747
01:54:33,172 --> 01:54:34,241
quantity, sir.

1748
01:54:34,241 --> 01:54:39,941
The terms finally arrived at were one hundred and fifty dollars for the party."

1749
01:54:39,941 --> 01:54:44,002
I thought a bit. "Payable in advance?"

1750
01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:45,241
"No, sir.

1751
01:54:45,241 --> 01:54:50,591
I endeavoured to obtain payment in advance, but was not successful."

1752
01:54:50,591 --> 01:54:54,091
"Well, any way, when we get it I'll make it up to five hundred.

1753
01:54:54,091 --> 01:54:55,711
Bicky'll never know.

1754
01:54:55,711 --> 01:54:59,252
Do you suspect Mr. Bickersteth would suspect anything, Jeeves, if I made it up

1755
01:54:59,252 --> 01:55:03,172
to five hundred?" "I fancy not, sir.

1756
01:55:03,172 --> 01:55:08,282
Mr. Bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman, but not bright."

1757
01:55:08,282 --> 01:55:11,162
"All right, then. After breakfast run down to the bank and

1758
01:55:11,162 --> 01:55:12,711
get me some money."

1759
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:16,002
"Yes, sir." "You know, you're a bit of a marvel,

1760
01:55:16,002 --> 01:55:18,821
Jeeves." "Thank you, sir."

1761
01:55:18,821 --> 01:55:19,782
"Right-o!"

1762
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:24,331
"Very good, sir." When I took dear old Bicky aside in the

1763
01:55:24,331 --> 01:55:28,542
course of the morning and told him what had happened he nearly broke down.

1764
01:55:28,542 --> 01:55:32,731
He tottered into the sitting-room and buttonholed old Chiswick, who was reading

1765
01:55:32,731 --> 01:55:38,012
the comic section of the morning paper with a kind of grim resolution.

1766
01:55:38,012 --> 01:55:42,111
"Uncle," he said, "are you doing anything special to-morrow afternoon?

1767
01:55:42,111 --> 01:55:47,481
I mean to say, I've asked a few of my pals in to meet you, don't you know."

1768
01:55:47,481 --> 01:55:51,301
The old boy cocked a speculative eye at him.

1769
01:55:51,301 --> 01:55:54,711
"There will be no reporters among them?" "Reporters?

1770
01:55:54,711 --> 01:55:55,441
Rather not!

1771
01:55:55,441 --> 01:55:59,961
Why?" "I refuse to be badgered by reporters.

1772
01:55:59,961 --> 01:56:04,181
There were a number of adhesive young men who endeavoured to elicit from me my views

1773
01:56:04,181 --> 01:56:07,002
on America while the boat was approaching the dock.

1774
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:09,752
I will not be subjected to this persecution again."

1775
01:56:09,752 --> 01:56:14,882
"That'll be absolutely all right, uncle. There won't be a newspaper-man in the

1776
01:56:14,882 --> 01:56:15,512
place."

1777
01:56:15,512 --> 01:56:21,032
"In that case I shall be glad to make the acquaintance of your friends."

1778
01:56:21,032 --> 01:56:23,672
"You'll shake hands with them and so forth?"

1779
01:56:23,672 --> 01:56:26,882
"I shall naturally order my behaviour according to the accepted rules of

1780
01:56:26,882 --> 01:56:29,502
civilized intercourse."

1781
01:56:29,502 --> 01:56:33,701
Bicky thanked him heartily and came off to lunch with me at the club, where he babbled

1782
01:56:33,701 --> 01:56:37,961
freely of hens, incubators, and other rotten things.

1783
01:56:37,961 --> 01:56:42,502
After mature consideration we had decided to unleash the Birdsburg contingent on the

1784
01:56:42,502 --> 01:56:45,081
old boy ten at a time.

1785
01:56:45,081 --> 01:56:48,782
Jeeves brought his theatre pal round to see us, and we arranged the whole thing with

1786
01:56:48,782 --> 01:56:48,931
him.

1787
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:54,451
A very decent chappie, but rather inclined to collar the conversation and turn it in

1788
01:56:54,451 --> 01:56:57,611
the direction of his home-town's new water- supply system.

1789
01:56:57,611 --> 01:57:02,061
We settled that, as an hour was about all he would be likely to stand, each gang

1790
01:57:02,061 --> 01:57:05,991
should consider itself entitled to seven minutes of the duke's society by Jeeves's

1791
01:57:05,991 --> 01:57:08,642
stop-watch, and that when their time was up

1792
01:57:08,642 --> 01:57:12,372
Jeeves should slide into the room and cough meaningly.

1793
01:57:12,372 --> 01:57:17,081
Then we parted with what I believe are called mutual expressions of goodwill, the

1794
01:57:17,081 --> 01:57:21,331
Birdsburg chappie extending a cordial invitation to us all to pop out some day

1795
01:57:21,331 --> 01:57:25,652
and take a look at the new water-supply system, for which we thanked him.

1796
01:57:25,652 --> 01:57:28,981
Next day the deputation rolled in.

1797
01:57:28,981 --> 01:57:33,662
The first shift consisted of the cove we had met and nine others almost exactly like

1798
01:57:33,662 --> 01:57:35,551
him in every respect.

1799
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:40,571
They all looked deuced keen and businesslike, as if from youth up they had

1800
01:57:40,571 --> 01:57:44,321
been working in the office and catching the boss's eye and what-not.

1801
01:57:44,321 --> 01:57:48,792
They shook hands with the old boy with a good deal of apparent satisfaction--all

1802
01:57:48,792 --> 01:57:52,551
except one chappie, who seemed to be brooding about something--and then they

1803
01:57:52,551 --> 01:57:55,652
stood off and became chatty.

1804
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:59,241
"What message have you for Birdsburg, Duke?" asked our pal.

1805
01:57:59,241 --> 01:58:03,471
The old boy seemed a bit rattled. "I have never been to Birdsburg."

1806
01:58:03,471 --> 01:58:06,132
The chappie seemed pained.

1807
01:58:06,132 --> 01:58:09,591
"You should pay it a visit," he said. "The most rapidly-growing city in the

1808
01:58:09,591 --> 01:58:12,762
country. Boost for Birdsburg!"

1809
01:58:12,762 --> 01:58:16,471
"Boost for Birdsburg!" said the other chappies reverently.

1810
01:58:16,471 --> 01:58:19,622
The chappie who had been brooding suddenly gave tongue.

1811
01:58:19,622 --> 01:58:20,961
"Say!"

1812
01:58:20,961 --> 01:58:25,711
He was a stout sort of well-fed cove with one of those determined chins and a cold

1813
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:29,412
eye. The assemblage looked at him.

1814
01:58:29,412 --> 01:58:33,902
"As a matter of business," said the chappie--"mind you, I'm not questioning

1815
01:58:33,902 --> 01:58:38,571
anybody's good faith, but, as a matter of strict business--I think this gentleman

1816
01:58:38,571 --> 01:58:40,532
here ought to put himself on record before

1817
01:58:40,532 --> 01:58:44,171
witnesses as stating that he really is a duke."

1818
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:48,532
"What do you mean, sir?" cried the old boy, getting purple.

1819
01:58:48,532 --> 01:58:50,872
"No offence, simply business.

1820
01:58:50,872 --> 01:58:54,361
I'm not saying anything, mind you, but there's one thing that seems kind of funny

1821
01:58:54,361 --> 01:58:57,512
to me. This gentleman here says his name's Mr.

1822
01:58:57,512 --> 01:58:59,542
Bickersteth, as I understand it.

1823
01:58:59,542 --> 01:59:03,721
Well, if you're the Duke of Chiswick, why isn't he Lord Percy Something?

1824
01:59:03,721 --> 01:59:06,792
I've read English novels, and I know all about it."

1825
01:59:06,792 --> 01:59:09,122
"This is monstrous!"

1826
01:59:09,122 --> 01:59:12,991
"Now don't get hot under the collar. I'm only asking.

1827
01:59:12,991 --> 01:59:15,032
I've a right to know.

1828
01:59:15,032 --> 01:59:18,431
You're going to take our money, so it's only fair that we should see that we get

1829
01:59:18,431 --> 01:59:22,171
our money's worth." The water-supply cove chipped in:

1830
01:59:22,171 --> 01:59:25,012
"You're quite right, Simms.

1831
01:59:25,012 --> 01:59:27,542
I overlooked that when making the agreement.

1832
01:59:27,542 --> 01:59:31,892
You see, gentlemen, as business men we've a right to reasonable guarantees of good

1833
01:59:31,892 --> 01:59:32,331
faith.

1834
01:59:32,331 --> 01:59:35,632
We are paying Mr. Bickersteth here a hundred and fifty dollars for this

1835
01:59:35,632 --> 01:59:38,561
reception, and we naturally want to know--- -"

1836
01:59:38,561 --> 01:59:44,341
Old Chiswick gave Bicky a searching look; then he turned to the water-supply chappie.

1837
01:59:44,341 --> 01:59:49,801
He was frightfully calm. "I can assure you that I know nothing of

1838
01:59:49,801 --> 01:59:51,932
this," he said, quite politely.

1839
01:59:51,932 --> 01:59:56,981
"I should be grateful if you would explain."

1840
01:59:56,981 --> 02:00:01,501
"Well, we arranged with Mr. Bickersteth that eighty-seven citizens of Birdsburg

1841
02:00:01,501 --> 02:00:05,392
should have the privilege of meeting and shaking hands with you for a financial

1842
02:00:05,392 --> 02:00:08,011
consideration mutually arranged, and what

1843
02:00:08,011 --> 02:00:12,761
my friend Simms here means--and I'm with him--is that we have only Mr. Bickersteth's

1844
02:00:12,761 --> 02:00:18,392
word for it--and he is a stranger to us-- that you are the Duke of Chiswick at all."

1845
02:00:18,392 --> 02:00:21,501
Old Chiswick gulped.

1846
02:00:21,501 --> 02:00:27,051
"Allow me to assure you, sir," he said, in a rummy kind of voice, "that I am the Duke

1847
02:00:27,051 --> 02:00:31,132
of Chiswick." "Then that's all right," said the chappie

1848
02:00:31,132 --> 02:00:32,241
heartily.

1849
02:00:32,241 --> 02:00:35,731
"That was all we wanted to know. Let the thing go on."

1850
02:00:35,731 --> 02:00:40,812
"I am sorry to say," said old Chiswick, "that it cannot go on.

1851
02:00:40,812 --> 02:00:42,922
I am feeling a little tired.

1852
02:00:42,922 --> 02:00:48,551
I fear I must ask to be excused." "But there are seventy-seven of the boys

1853
02:00:48,551 --> 02:00:52,402
waiting round the corner at this moment, Duke, to be introduced to you."

1854
02:00:52,402 --> 02:00:56,062
"I fear I must disappoint them."

1855
02:00:56,062 --> 02:00:58,422
"But in that case the deal would have to be off."

1856
02:00:58,422 --> 02:01:01,692
"That is a matter for you and my nephew to discuss."

1857
02:01:01,692 --> 02:01:05,722
The chappie seemed troubled.

1858
02:01:05,722 --> 02:01:09,842
"You really won't meet the rest of them?" "No!"

1859
02:01:09,842 --> 02:01:14,972
"Well, then, I guess we'll be going." They went out, and there was a pretty solid

1860
02:01:14,972 --> 02:01:16,082
silence.

1861
02:01:16,082 --> 02:01:21,301
Then old Chiswick turned to Bicky: "Well?"

1862
02:01:21,301 --> 02:01:27,791
Bicky didn't seem to have anything to say. "Was it true what that man said?"

1863
02:01:27,791 --> 02:01:29,452
"Yes, uncle."

1864
02:01:29,452 --> 02:01:35,172
"What do you mean by playing this trick?" Bicky seemed pretty well knocked out, so I

1865
02:01:35,172 --> 02:01:38,741
put in a word. "I think you'd better explain the whole

1866
02:01:38,741 --> 02:01:41,322
thing, Bicky, old top."

1867
02:01:41,322 --> 02:01:45,481
Bicky's Adam's-apple jumped about a bit; then he started:

1868
02:01:45,481 --> 02:01:49,942
"You see, you had cut off my allowance, uncle, and I wanted a bit of money to start

1869
02:01:49,942 --> 02:01:51,261
a chicken farm.

1870
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:54,902
I mean to say it's an absolute cert if you once get a bit of capital.

1871
02:01:54,902 --> 02:01:59,741
You buy a hen, and it lays an egg every day of the week, and you sell the eggs, say,

1872
02:01:59,741 --> 02:02:02,612
seven for twenty-five cents.

1873
02:02:02,612 --> 02:02:05,962
"Keep of hens cost nothing. Profit practically----"

1874
02:02:05,962 --> 02:02:10,422
"What is all this nonsense about hens? You led me to suppose you were a

1875
02:02:10,422 --> 02:02:13,281
substantial business man."

1876
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:17,241
"Old Bicky rather exaggerated, sir," I said, helping the chappie out.

1877
02:02:17,241 --> 02:02:21,392
"The fact is, the poor old lad is absolutely dependent on that remittance of

1878
02:02:21,392 --> 02:02:26,541
yours, and when you cut it off, don't you know, he was pretty solidly in the soup,

1879
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:30,741
and had to think of some way of closing in on a bit of the ready pretty quick.

1880
02:02:30,741 --> 02:02:34,402
That's why we thought of this handshaking scheme."

1881
02:02:34,402 --> 02:02:37,481
Old Chiswick foamed at the mouth.

1882
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:42,342
"So you have lied to me! You have deliberately deceived me as to

1883
02:02:42,342 --> 02:02:47,342
your financial status!" "Poor old Bicky didn't want to go to that

1884
02:02:47,342 --> 02:02:48,852
ranch," I explained.

1885
02:02:48,852 --> 02:02:52,981
"He doesn't like cows and horses, but he rather thinks he would be hot stuff among

1886
02:02:52,981 --> 02:02:56,312
the hens. All he wants is a bit of capital.

1887
02:02:56,312 --> 02:02:58,842
Don't you think it would be rather a wheeze if you were to----"

1888
02:02:58,842 --> 02:03:04,632
"After what has happened? After this--this deceit and foolery?

1889
02:03:04,632 --> 02:03:05,432
Not a penny!"

1890
02:03:05,432 --> 02:03:10,462
"But----" "Not a penny!"

1891
02:03:10,462 --> 02:03:14,222
There was a respectful cough in the background.

1892
02:03:14,222 --> 02:03:17,322
"If I might make a suggestion, sir?"

1893
02:03:17,322 --> 02:03:20,362
Jeeves was standing on the horizon, looking devilish brainy.

1894
02:03:20,362 --> 02:03:24,142
"Go ahead, Jeeves!" I said.

1895
02:03:24,142 --> 02:03:28,382
"I would merely suggest, sir, that if Mr. Bickersteth is in need of a little ready

1896
02:03:28,382 --> 02:03:33,481
money, and is at a loss to obtain it elsewhere, he might secure the sum he

1897
02:03:33,481 --> 02:03:35,612
requires by describing the occurrences of

1898
02:03:35,612 --> 02:03:39,682
this afternoon for the Sunday issue of one of the more spirited and enterprising

1899
02:03:39,682 --> 02:03:42,731
newspapers." "By Jove!"

1900
02:03:42,731 --> 02:03:44,082
I said.

1901
02:03:44,082 --> 02:03:49,642
"By George!" said Bicky. "Great heavens!" said old Chiswick.

1902
02:03:49,642 --> 02:03:54,051
"Very good, sir," said Jeeves. Bicky turned to old Chiswick with a

1903
02:03:54,051 --> 02:03:55,632
gleaming eye.

1904
02:03:55,632 --> 02:03:58,202
"Jeeves is right. I'll do it!

1905
02:03:58,202 --> 02:04:02,771
The Chronicle would jump at it. They eat that sort of stuff."

1906
02:04:02,771 --> 02:04:06,072
Old Chiswick gave a kind of moaning howl.

1907
02:04:06,072 --> 02:04:09,021
"I absolutely forbid you, Francis, to do this thing!"

1908
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:14,922
"That's all very well," said Bicky, wonderfully braced, "but if I can't get the

1909
02:04:14,922 --> 02:04:16,332
money any other way----"

1910
02:04:16,332 --> 02:04:18,991
"Wait! Er--wait, my boy!

1911
02:04:18,991 --> 02:04:23,731
You are so impetuous! We might arrange something."

1912
02:04:23,731 --> 02:04:26,222
"I won't go to that bally ranch."

1913
02:04:26,222 --> 02:04:28,021
"No, no! No, no, my boy!

1914
02:04:28,021 --> 02:04:31,862
I would not suggest it. I would not for a moment suggest it.

1915
02:04:31,862 --> 02:04:33,991
I--I think----"

1916
02:04:33,991 --> 02:04:37,231
He seemed to have a bit of a struggle with himself.

1917
02:04:37,231 --> 02:04:44,212
"I--I think that, on the whole, it would be best if you returned with me to England.

1918
02:04:44,212 --> 02:04:51,852
I--I might--in fact, I think I see my way to doing--to--I might be able to utilize

1919
02:04:51,852 --> 02:04:55,672
your services in some secretarial position."

1920
02:04:55,672 --> 02:04:58,352
"I shouldn't mind that."

1921
02:04:58,352 --> 02:05:02,372
"I should not be able to offer you a salary, but, as you know, in English

1922
02:05:02,372 --> 02:05:07,281
political life the unpaid secretary is a recognized figure----"

1923
02:05:07,281 --> 02:05:11,741
"The only figure I'll recognize," said Bicky firmly, "is five hundred quid a year,

1924
02:05:11,741 --> 02:05:15,852
paid quarterly." "My dear boy!"

1925
02:05:15,852 --> 02:05:17,422
"Absolutely!"

1926
02:05:17,422 --> 02:05:21,271
"But your recompense, my dear Francis, would consist in the unrivalled

1927
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:26,212
opportunities you would have, as my secretary, to gain experience, to accustom

1928
02:05:26,212 --> 02:05:28,501
yourself to the intricacies of political

1929
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:35,291
life, to--in fact, you would be in an exceedingly advantageous position."

1930
02:05:35,291 --> 02:05:39,612
"Five hundred a year!" said Bicky, rolling it round his tongue.

1931
02:05:39,612 --> 02:05:44,481
"Why, that would be nothing to what I could make if I started a chicken farm.

1932
02:05:44,481 --> 02:05:48,072
It stands to reason. Suppose you have a dozen hens.

1933
02:05:48,072 --> 02:05:50,682
Each of the hens has a dozen chickens.

1934
02:05:50,682 --> 02:05:55,122
After a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozen chickens each themselves, and then

1935
02:05:55,122 --> 02:05:58,462
they all start laying eggs! There's a fortune in it.

1936
02:05:58,462 --> 02:06:01,251
You can get anything you like for eggs in America.

1937
02:06:01,251 --> 02:06:04,882
Chappies keep them on ice for years and years, and don't sell them till they fetch

1938
02:06:04,882 --> 02:06:06,452
about a dollar a whirl.

1939
02:06:06,452 --> 02:06:10,202
You don't think I'm going to chuck a future like this for anything under five hundred

1940
02:06:10,202 --> 02:06:12,781
o' goblins a year--what?"

1941
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:17,731
A look of anguish passed over old Chiswick's face, then he seemed to be

1942
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:22,562
resigned to it. "Very well, my boy," he said.

1943
02:06:22,562 --> 02:06:24,011
"What-o!" said Bicky.

1944
02:06:24,011 --> 02:06:28,481
"All right, then." "Jeeves," I said.

1945
02:06:28,481 --> 02:06:32,682
Bicky had taken the old boy off to dinner to celebrate, and we were alone.

1946
02:06:32,682 --> 02:06:36,572
"Jeeves, this has been one of your best efforts."

1947
02:06:36,572 --> 02:06:40,092
"Thank you, sir." "It beats me how you do it."

1948
02:06:40,092 --> 02:06:41,812
"Yes, sir."

1949
02:06:41,812 --> 02:06:46,062
"The only trouble is you haven't got much out of it--what!"

1950
02:06:46,062 --> 02:06:51,291
"I fancy Mr. Bickersteth intends--I judge from his remarks--to signify his

1951
02:06:51,291 --> 02:06:55,712
appreciation of anything I have been fortunate enough to do to assist him, at

1952
02:06:55,712 --> 02:07:01,021
some later date when he is in a more favourable position to do so."

1953
02:07:01,021 --> 02:07:02,822
"It isn't enough, Jeeves!" "Sir?"

1954
02:07:02,822 --> 02:07:09,892
It was a wrench, but I felt it was the only possible thing to be done.

1955
02:07:09,892 --> 02:07:14,932
"Bring my shaving things." A gleam of hope shone in the chappie's eye,

1956
02:07:14,932 --> 02:07:16,862
mixed with doubt.

1957
02:07:16,862 --> 02:07:21,741
"You mean, sir?" "And shave off my moustache."

1958
02:07:21,741 --> 02:07:27,312
There was a moment's silence. I could see the fellow was deeply moved.

1959
02:07:27,312 --> 02:07:38,542
"Thank you very much indeed, sir," he said, in a low voice, and popped off.

1960
02:07:38,542 --> 02:07:39,542
>

1961
02:07:39,542 --> 02:07:48,482
CHAPTER 4 ABSENT TREATMENT

1962
02:07:48,482 --> 02:07:52,622
I want to tell you all about dear old Bobbie Cardew.

1963
02:07:52,622 --> 02:07:55,251
It's a most interesting story.

1964
02:07:55,251 --> 02:08:00,362
I can't put in any literary style and all that; but I don't have to, don't you know,

1965
02:08:00,362 --> 02:08:02,301
because it goes on its Moral Lesson.

1966
02:08:02,301 --> 02:08:08,641
If you're a man you mustn't miss it, because it'll be a warning to you; and if

1967
02:08:08,641 --> 02:08:13,842
you're a woman you won't want to, because it's all about how a girl made a man feel

1968
02:08:13,842 --> 02:08:15,932
pretty well fed up with things.

1969
02:08:15,932 --> 02:08:20,772
If you're a recent acquaintance of Bobbie's, you'll probably be surprised to

1970
02:08:20,772 --> 02:08:25,142
hear that there was a time when he was more remarkable for the weakness of his memory

1971
02:08:25,142 --> 02:08:27,302
than anything else.

1972
02:08:27,302 --> 02:08:32,182
Dozens of fellows, who have only met Bobbie since the change took place, have been

1973
02:08:32,182 --> 02:08:35,872
surprised when I told them that. Yet it's true.

1974
02:08:35,872 --> 02:08:38,362
Believe me.

1975
02:08:38,362 --> 02:08:42,912
In the days when I first knew him Bobbie Cardew was about the most pronounced young

1976
02:08:42,912 --> 02:08:48,562
rotter inside the four-mile radius. People have called me a silly ass, but I

1977
02:08:48,562 --> 02:08:51,451
was never in the same class with Bobbie.

1978
02:08:51,451 --> 02:08:56,892
When it came to being a silly ass, he was a plus-four man, while my handicap was about

1979
02:08:56,892 --> 02:08:58,111
six.

1980
02:08:58,111 --> 02:09:02,971
Why, if I wanted him to dine with me, I used to post him a letter at the beginning

1981
02:09:02,971 --> 02:09:07,291
of the week, and then the day before send him a telegram and a phone-call on the day

1982
02:09:07,291 --> 02:09:10,361
itself, and--half an hour before the time

1983
02:09:10,361 --> 02:09:15,681
we'd fixed--a messenger in a taxi, whose business it was to see that he got in and

1984
02:09:15,681 --> 02:09:18,422
that the chauffeur had the address all correct.

1985
02:09:18,422 --> 02:09:22,981
By doing this I generally managed to get him, unless he had left town before my

1986
02:09:22,981 --> 02:09:27,322
messenger arrived. The funny thing was that he wasn't

1987
02:09:27,322 --> 02:09:29,981
altogether a fool in other ways.

1988
02:09:29,981 --> 02:09:34,021
Deep down in him there was a kind of stratum of sense.

1989
02:09:34,021 --> 02:09:39,071
I had known him, once or twice, show an almost human intelligence.

1990
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:43,392
But to reach that stratum, mind you, you needed dynamite.

1991
02:09:43,392 --> 02:09:48,072
At least, that's what I thought. But there was another way which hadn't

1992
02:09:48,072 --> 02:09:49,492
occurred to me.

1993
02:09:49,492 --> 02:09:54,682
Marriage, I mean. Marriage, the dynamite of the soul; that

1994
02:09:54,682 --> 02:09:58,031
was what hit Bobbie. He married.

1995
02:09:58,031 --> 02:10:01,382
Have you ever seen a bull-pup chasing a bee?

1996
02:10:01,382 --> 02:10:04,762
The pup sees the bee. It looks good to him.

1997
02:10:04,762 --> 02:10:08,762
But he still doesn't know what's at the end of it till he gets there.

1998
02:10:08,762 --> 02:10:10,882
It was like that with Bobbie.

1999
02:10:10,882 --> 02:10:16,251
He fell in love, got married--with a sort of whoop, as if it were the greatest fun in

2000
02:10:16,251 --> 02:10:20,421
the world--and then began to find out things.

2001
02:10:20,421 --> 02:10:24,522
She wasn't the sort of girl you would have expected Bobbie to rave about.

2002
02:10:24,522 --> 02:10:26,162
And yet, I don't know.

2003
02:10:26,162 --> 02:10:30,822
What I mean is, she worked for her living; and to a fellow who has never done a hand's

2004
02:10:30,822 --> 02:10:36,371
turn in his life there's undoubtedly a sort of fascination, a kind of romance, about a

2005
02:10:36,371 --> 02:10:38,341
girl who works for her living.

2006
02:10:38,341 --> 02:10:41,981
Her name was Anthony. Mary Anthony.

2007
02:10:41,981 --> 02:10:48,902
She was about five feet six; she had a ton and a half of red-gold hair, grey eyes, and

2008
02:10:48,902 --> 02:10:51,641
one of those determined chins.

2009
02:10:51,641 --> 02:10:54,391
She was a hospital nurse.

2010
02:10:54,391 --> 02:10:59,442
When Bobbie smashed himself up at polo, she was told off by the authorities to smooth

2011
02:10:59,442 --> 02:11:04,451
his brow and rally round with cooling unguents and all that; and the old boy

2012
02:11:04,451 --> 02:11:06,311
hadn't been up and about again for more

2013
02:11:06,311 --> 02:11:10,792
than a week before they popped off to the registrar's and fixed it up.

2014
02:11:10,792 --> 02:11:13,781
Quite the romance.

2015
02:11:13,781 --> 02:11:18,292
Bobbie broke the news to me at the club one evening, and next day he introduced me to

2016
02:11:18,292 --> 02:11:21,272
her. I admired her.

2017
02:11:21,272 --> 02:11:25,052
I've never worked myself--my name's Pepper, by the way.

2018
02:11:25,052 --> 02:11:27,832
Almost forgot to mention it. Reggie Pepper.

2019
02:11:27,832 --> 02:11:32,151
My uncle Edward was Pepper, Wells, and Co., the Colliery people.

2020
02:11:32,151 --> 02:11:37,582
He left me a sizable chunk of bullion--I say I've never worked myself, but I admire

2021
02:11:37,582 --> 02:11:42,001
any one who earns a living under difficulties, especially a girl.

2022
02:11:42,001 --> 02:11:46,492
And this girl had had a rather unusually tough time of it, being an orphan and all

2023
02:11:46,492 --> 02:11:51,841
that, and having had to do everything off her own bat for years.

2024
02:11:51,841 --> 02:11:54,261
Mary and I got along together splendidly.

2025
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:59,852
We don't now, but we'll come to that later. I'm speaking of the past.

2026
02:11:59,852 --> 02:12:03,852
She seemed to think Bobbie the greatest thing on earth, judging by the way she

2027
02:12:03,852 --> 02:12:06,502
looked at him when she thought I wasn't noticing.

2028
02:12:06,502 --> 02:12:09,792
And Bobbie seemed to think the same about her.

2029
02:12:09,792 --> 02:12:14,442
So that I came to the conclusion that, if only dear old Bobbie didn't forget to go to

2030
02:12:14,442 --> 02:12:18,762
the wedding, they had a sporting chance of being quite happy.

2031
02:12:18,762 --> 02:12:22,322
Well, let's brisk up a bit here, and jump a year.

2032
02:12:22,322 --> 02:12:29,122
The story doesn't really start till then. They took a flat and settled down.

2033
02:12:29,122 --> 02:12:31,762
I was in and out of the place quite a good deal.

2034
02:12:31,762 --> 02:12:36,752
I kept my eyes open, and everything seemed to me to be running along as smoothly as

2035
02:12:36,752 --> 02:12:38,252
you could want.

2036
02:12:38,252 --> 02:12:42,972
If this was marriage, I thought, I couldn't see why fellows were so frightened of it.

2037
02:12:42,972 --> 02:12:45,372
There were a lot of worse things that could happen to a man.

2038
02:12:45,372 --> 02:12:51,012
But we now come to the incident of the quiet Dinner, and it's just here that

2039
02:12:51,012 --> 02:12:56,241
love's young dream hits a snag, and things begin to occur.

2040
02:12:56,241 --> 02:13:00,592
I happened to meet Bobbie in Piccadilly, and he asked me to come back to dinner at

2041
02:13:00,592 --> 02:13:01,822
the flat.

2042
02:13:01,822 --> 02:13:07,322
And, like a fool, instead of bolting and putting myself under police protection, I

2043
02:13:07,322 --> 02:13:09,181
went.

2044
02:13:09,181 --> 02:13:13,902
When we got to the flat, there was Mrs. Bobbie looking--well, I tell you, it

2045
02:13:13,902 --> 02:13:15,422
staggered me.

2046
02:13:15,422 --> 02:13:20,592
Her gold hair was all piled up in waves and crinkles and things, with a what-d'-you-

2047
02:13:20,592 --> 02:13:24,051
call-it of diamonds in it. And she was wearing the most perfectly

2048
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:25,532
ripping dress.

2049
02:13:25,532 --> 02:13:31,012
I couldn't begin to describe it. I can only say it was the limit.

2050
02:13:31,012 --> 02:13:34,922
It struck me that if this was how she was in the habit of looking every night when

2051
02:13:34,922 --> 02:13:39,211
they were dining quietly at home together, it was no wonder that Bobbie liked

2052
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:40,002
domesticity.

2053
02:13:40,002 --> 02:13:46,092
"Here's old Reggie, dear," said Bobbie. "I've brought him home to have a bit of

2054
02:13:46,092 --> 02:13:48,982
dinner. I'll phone down to the kitchen and ask them

2055
02:13:48,982 --> 02:13:51,081
to send it up now--what?"

2056
02:13:51,081 --> 02:13:54,741
She stared at him as if she had never seen him before.

2057
02:13:54,741 --> 02:13:59,331
Then she turned scarlet. Then she turned as white as a sheet.

2058
02:13:59,331 --> 02:14:01,622
Then she gave a little laugh.

2059
02:14:01,622 --> 02:14:06,852
It was most interesting to watch. Made me wish I was up a tree about eight

2060
02:14:06,852 --> 02:14:10,831
hundred miles away. Then she recovered herself.

2061
02:14:10,831 --> 02:14:16,752
"I am so glad you were able to come, Mr. Pepper," she said, smiling at me.

2062
02:14:16,752 --> 02:14:21,331
And after that she was all right. At least, you would have said so.

2063
02:14:21,331 --> 02:14:26,382
She talked a lot at dinner, and chaffed Bobbie, and played us ragtime on the piano

2064
02:14:26,382 --> 02:14:30,152
afterwards, as if she hadn't a care in the world.

2065
02:14:30,152 --> 02:14:34,051
Quite a jolly little party it was--not.

2066
02:14:34,051 --> 02:14:39,442
I'm no lynx-eyed sleuth, and all that sort of thing, but I had seen her face at the

2067
02:14:39,442 --> 02:14:44,122
beginning, and I knew that she was working the whole time and working hard, to keep

2068
02:14:44,122 --> 02:14:46,762
herself in hand, and that she would have

2069
02:14:46,762 --> 02:14:51,152
given that diamond what's-its-name in her hair and everything else she possessed to

2070
02:14:51,152 --> 02:14:54,352
have one good scream--just one.

2071
02:14:54,352 --> 02:14:59,442
I've sat through some pretty thick evenings in my time, but that one had the rest

2072
02:14:59,442 --> 02:15:03,361
beaten in a canter. At the very earliest moment I grabbed my

2073
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:06,092
hat and got away.

2074
02:15:06,092 --> 02:15:10,252
Having seen what I did, I wasn't particularly surprised to meet Bobbie at

2075
02:15:10,252 --> 02:15:15,152
the club next day looking about as merry and bright as a lonely gum-drop at an

2076
02:15:15,152 --> 02:15:16,072
Eskimo tea-party.

2077
02:15:16,072 --> 02:15:22,232
He started in straightway. He seemed glad to have someone to talk to

2078
02:15:22,232 --> 02:15:25,831
about it. "Do you know how long I've been married?"

2079
02:15:25,831 --> 02:15:26,961
he said.

2080
02:15:26,961 --> 02:15:31,542
I didn't exactly. "About a year, isn't it?"

2081
02:15:31,542 --> 02:15:38,562
"Not about a year," he said sadly. "Exactly a year--yesterday!"

2082
02:15:38,562 --> 02:15:40,382
Then I understood.

2083
02:15:40,382 --> 02:15:45,921
I saw light--a regular flash of light. "Yesterday was----?"

2084
02:15:45,921 --> 02:15:51,051
"The anniversary of the wedding. I'd arranged to take Mary to the Savoy, and

2085
02:15:51,051 --> 02:15:53,512
on to Covent Garden.

2086
02:15:53,512 --> 02:15:59,192
She particularly wanted to hear Caruso. I had the ticket for the box in my pocket.

2087
02:15:59,192 --> 02:16:03,402
Do you know, all through dinner I had a kind of rummy idea that there was something

2088
02:16:03,402 --> 02:16:05,912
I'd forgotten, but I couldn't think what?"

2089
02:16:05,912 --> 02:16:10,231
"Till your wife mentioned it?" He nodded----

2090
02:16:10,231 --> 02:16:17,641
"She--mentioned it," he said thoughtfully. I didn't ask for details.

2091
02:16:17,641 --> 02:16:23,451
Women with hair and chins like Mary's may be angels most of the time, but, when they

2092
02:16:23,451 --> 02:16:28,642
take off their wings for a bit, they aren't half-hearted about it.

2093
02:16:28,642 --> 02:16:34,082
"To be absolutely frank, old top," said poor old Bobbie, in a broken sort of way,

2094
02:16:34,082 --> 02:16:40,371
"my stock's pretty low at home." There didn't seem much to be done.

2095
02:16:40,371 --> 02:16:43,302
I just lit a cigarette and sat there.

2096
02:16:43,302 --> 02:16:47,131
He didn't want to talk. Presently he went out.

2097
02:16:47,131 --> 02:16:52,402
I stood at the window of our upper smoking- room, which looks out on to Piccadilly, and

2098
02:16:52,402 --> 02:16:53,571
watched him.

2099
02:16:53,571 --> 02:16:59,952
He walked slowly along for a few yards, stopped, then walked on again, and finally

2100
02:16:59,952 --> 02:17:02,222
turned into a jeweller's.

2101
02:17:02,222 --> 02:17:06,631
Which was an instance of what I meant when I said that deep down in him there was a

2102
02:17:06,631 --> 02:17:09,612
certain stratum of sense.

2103
02:17:09,612 --> 02:17:13,472
It was from now on that I began to be really interested in this problem of

2104
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,522
Bobbie's married life.

2105
02:17:15,522 --> 02:17:20,362
Of course, one's always mildly interested in one's friends' marriages, hoping they'll

2106
02:17:20,362 --> 02:17:24,082
turn out well and all that; but this was different.

2107
02:17:24,082 --> 02:17:29,032
The average man isn't like Bobbie, and the average girl isn't like Mary.

2108
02:17:29,032 --> 02:17:33,832
It was that old business of the immovable mass and the irresistible force.

2109
02:17:33,832 --> 02:17:39,482
There was Bobbie, ambling gently through life, a dear old chap in a hundred ways,

2110
02:17:39,482 --> 02:17:45,772
but undoubtedly a chump of the first water. And there was Mary, determined that he

2111
02:17:45,772 --> 02:17:47,862
shouldn't be a chump.

2112
02:17:47,862 --> 02:17:54,722
And Nature, mind you, on Bobbie's side. When Nature makes a chump like dear old

2113
02:17:54,722 --> 02:17:59,292
Bobbie, she's proud of him, and doesn't want her handiwork disturbed.

2114
02:17:59,292 --> 02:18:04,931
She gives him a sort of natural armour to protect him against outside interference.

2115
02:18:04,931 --> 02:18:10,772
And that armour is shortness of memory. Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump,

2116
02:18:10,772 --> 02:18:14,352
when, but for it, he might cease to be one.

2117
02:18:14,352 --> 02:18:17,542
Take my case, for instance. I'm a chump.

2118
02:18:17,542 --> 02:18:20,912
Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my

2119
02:18:20,912 --> 02:18:24,462
life, my size in hats would be about number nine.

2120
02:18:24,462 --> 02:18:25,532
But I didn't.

2121
02:18:25,532 --> 02:18:29,102
I forgot them. And it was just the same with Bobbie.

2122
02:18:29,102 --> 02:18:35,762
For about a week, perhaps a bit more, the recollection of that quiet little domestic

2123
02:18:35,762 --> 02:18:38,332
evening bucked him up like a tonic.

2124
02:18:38,332 --> 02:18:43,431
Elephants, I read somewhere, are champions at the memory business, but they were fools

2125
02:18:43,431 --> 02:18:48,472
to Bobbie during that week. But, bless you, the shock wasn't nearly big

2126
02:18:48,472 --> 02:18:49,392
enough.

2127
02:18:49,392 --> 02:18:53,931
It had dinted the armour, but it hadn't made a hole in it.

2128
02:18:53,931 --> 02:18:59,642
Pretty soon he was back at the old game. It was pathetic, don't you know.

2129
02:18:59,642 --> 02:19:03,832
The poor girl loved him, and she was frightened.

2130
02:19:03,832 --> 02:19:07,582
It was the thin edge of the wedge, you see, and she knew it.

2131
02:19:07,582 --> 02:19:12,792
A man who forgets what day he was married, when he's been married one year, will

2132
02:19:12,792 --> 02:19:17,131
forget, at about the end of the fourth, that he's married at all.

2133
02:19:17,131 --> 02:19:21,972
If she meant to get him in hand at all, she had got to do it now, before he began to

2134
02:19:21,972 --> 02:19:23,832
drift away.

2135
02:19:23,832 --> 02:19:28,821
I saw that clearly enough, and I tried to make Bobbie see it, when he was by way of

2136
02:19:28,821 --> 02:19:31,722
pouring out his troubles to me one afternoon.

2137
02:19:31,722 --> 02:19:36,392
I can't remember what it was that he had forgotten the day before, but it was

2138
02:19:36,392 --> 02:19:40,172
something she had asked him to bring home for her--it may have been a book.

2139
02:19:40,172 --> 02:19:45,262
"It's such a little thing to make a fuss about," said Bobbie.

2140
02:19:45,262 --> 02:19:48,722
"And she knows that it's simply because I've got such an infernal memory about

2141
02:19:48,722 --> 02:19:49,751
everything.

2142
02:19:49,751 --> 02:19:53,681
I can't remember anything. Never could."

2143
02:19:53,681 --> 02:19:57,941
He talked on for a while, and, just as he was going, he pulled out a couple of

2144
02:19:57,941 --> 02:19:59,422
sovereigns.

2145
02:19:59,422 --> 02:20:02,052
"Oh, by the way," he said. "What's this for?"

2146
02:20:02,052 --> 02:20:04,972
I asked, though I knew. "I owe it you."

2147
02:20:04,972 --> 02:20:06,202
"How's that?"

2148
02:20:06,202 --> 02:20:10,001
I said. "Why, that bet on Tuesday.

2149
02:20:10,001 --> 02:20:11,592
In the billiard-room.

2150
02:20:11,592 --> 02:20:15,662
Murray and Brown were playing a hundred up, and I gave you two to one that Brown would

2151
02:20:15,662 --> 02:20:21,402
win, and Murray beat him by twenty odd." "So you do remember some things?"

2152
02:20:21,402 --> 02:20:23,112
I said.

2153
02:20:23,112 --> 02:20:24,821
He got quite excited.

2154
02:20:24,821 --> 02:20:28,792
Said that if I thought he was the sort of rotter who forgot to pay when he lost a

2155
02:20:28,792 --> 02:20:33,262
bet, it was pretty rotten of me after knowing him all these years, and a lot more

2156
02:20:33,262 --> 02:20:35,102
like that.

2157
02:20:35,102 --> 02:20:41,262
"Subside, laddie," I said. Then I spoke to him like a father.

2158
02:20:41,262 --> 02:20:45,642
"What you've got to do, my old college chum," I said, "is to pull yourself

2159
02:20:45,642 --> 02:20:47,922
together, and jolly quick, too.

2160
02:20:47,922 --> 02:20:53,612
As things are shaping, you're due for a nasty knock before you know what's hit you.

2161
02:20:53,612 --> 02:20:56,612
You've got to make an effort. Don't say you can't.

2162
02:20:56,612 --> 02:21:02,082
This two quid business shows that, even if your memory is rocky, you can remember some

2163
02:21:02,082 --> 02:21:02,972
things.

2164
02:21:02,972 --> 02:21:07,342
What you've got to do is to see that wedding anniversaries and so on are

2165
02:21:07,342 --> 02:21:11,892
included in the list. It may be a brainstrain, but you can't get

2166
02:21:11,892 --> 02:21:12,232
out of it."

2167
02:21:12,232 --> 02:21:19,181
"I suppose you're right," said Bobbie. "But it beats me why she thinks such a lot

2168
02:21:19,181 --> 02:21:21,392
of these rotten little dates.

2169
02:21:21,392 --> 02:21:26,102
What's it matter if I forgot what day we were married on or what day she was born on

2170
02:21:26,102 --> 02:21:31,642
or what day the cat had the measles? She knows I love her just as much as if I

2171
02:21:31,642 --> 02:21:33,542
were a memorizing freak at the halls."

2172
02:21:33,542 --> 02:21:39,672
"That's not enough for a woman," I said. "They want to be shown.

2173
02:21:39,672 --> 02:21:45,751
Bear that in mind, and you're all right. Forget it, and there'll be trouble."

2174
02:21:45,751 --> 02:21:48,902
He chewed the knob of his stick.

2175
02:21:48,902 --> 02:21:52,431
"Women are frightfully rummy," he said gloomily.

2176
02:21:52,431 --> 02:21:56,821
"You should have thought of that before you married one," I said.

2177
02:21:56,821 --> 02:21:59,501
I don't see that I could have done any more.

2178
02:21:59,501 --> 02:22:02,392
I had put the whole thing in a nutshell for him.

2179
02:22:02,392 --> 02:22:05,832
You would have thought he'd have seen the point, and that it would have made him

2180
02:22:05,832 --> 02:22:10,112
brace up and get a hold on himself. But no.

2181
02:22:10,112 --> 02:22:13,571
Off he went again in the same old way.

2182
02:22:13,571 --> 02:22:18,491
I gave up arguing with him. I had a good deal of time on my hands, but

2183
02:22:18,491 --> 02:22:22,672
not enough to amount to anything when it was a question of reforming dear old Bobbie

2184
02:22:22,672 --> 02:22:24,102
by argument.

2185
02:22:24,102 --> 02:22:29,741
If you see a man asking for trouble, and insisting on getting it, the only thing to

2186
02:22:29,741 --> 02:22:33,462
do is to stand by and wait till it comes to him.

2187
02:22:33,462 --> 02:22:35,881
After that you may get a chance.

2188
02:22:35,881 --> 02:22:41,592
But till then there's nothing to be done. But I thought a lot about him.

2189
02:22:41,592 --> 02:22:44,902
Bobbie didn't get into the soup all at once.

2190
02:22:44,902 --> 02:22:48,941
Weeks went by, and months, and still nothing happened.

2191
02:22:48,941 --> 02:22:53,811
Now and then he'd come into the club with a kind of cloud on his shining morning face,

2192
02:22:53,811 --> 02:22:58,751
and I'd know that there had been doings in the home; but it wasn't till well on in the

2193
02:22:58,751 --> 02:23:01,311
spring that he got the thunderbolt just

2194
02:23:01,311 --> 02:23:06,012
where he had been asking for it--in the thorax.

2195
02:23:06,012 --> 02:23:10,422
I was smoking a quiet cigarette one morning in the window looking out over Piccadilly,

2196
02:23:10,422 --> 02:23:15,422
and watching the buses and motors going up one way and down the other--most

2197
02:23:15,422 --> 02:23:18,621
interesting it is; I often do it--when in

2198
02:23:18,621 --> 02:23:23,852
rushed Bobbie, with his eyes bulging and his face the colour of an oyster, waving a

2199
02:23:23,852 --> 02:23:28,082
piece of paper in his hand. "Reggie," he said.

2200
02:23:28,082 --> 02:23:30,751
"Reggie, old top, she's gone!"

2201
02:23:30,751 --> 02:23:31,801
"Gone!" I said.

2202
02:23:31,801 --> 02:23:34,121
"Who?" "Mary, of course!

2203
02:23:34,121 --> 02:23:35,152
Gone!

2204
02:23:35,152 --> 02:23:37,642
Left me! Gone!"

2205
02:23:37,642 --> 02:23:39,381
"Where?" I said.

2206
02:23:39,381 --> 02:23:40,811
Silly question?

2207
02:23:40,811 --> 02:23:44,332
Perhaps you're right. Anyhow, dear old Bobbie nearly foamed at

2208
02:23:44,332 --> 02:23:46,691
the mouth. "Where?

2209
02:23:46,691 --> 02:23:48,431
How should I know where?

2210
02:23:48,431 --> 02:23:52,371
Here, read this." He pushed the paper into my hand.

2211
02:23:52,371 --> 02:23:55,181
It was a letter. "Go on," said Bobbie.

2212
02:23:55,181 --> 02:23:57,202
"Read it."

2213
02:23:57,202 --> 02:24:00,972
So I did. It certainly was quite a letter.

2214
02:24:00,972 --> 02:24:04,262
There was not much of it, but it was all to the point.

2215
02:24:04,262 --> 02:24:06,311
This is what it said:

2216
02:24:06,311 --> 02:24:11,512
"MY DEAR BOBBIE,--I am going away. When you care enough about me to remember

2217
02:24:11,512 --> 02:24:16,082
to wish me many happy returns on my birthday, I will come back.

2218
02:24:16,082 --> 02:24:19,431
My address will be Box 341, London Morning News."

2219
02:24:19,431 --> 02:24:26,392
I read it twice, then I said, "Well, why don't you?"

2220
02:24:26,392 --> 02:24:28,441
"Why don't I what?"

2221
02:24:28,441 --> 02:24:34,292
"Why don't you wish her many happy returns? It doesn't seem much to ask."

2222
02:24:34,292 --> 02:24:39,821
"But she says on her birthday." "Well, when is her birthday?"

2223
02:24:39,821 --> 02:24:41,232
"Can't you understand?" said Bobbie.

2224
02:24:41,232 --> 02:24:44,501
"I've forgotten." "Forgotten!"

2225
02:24:44,501 --> 02:24:46,382
I said. "Yes," said Bobbie.

2226
02:24:46,382 --> 02:24:47,362
"Forgotten."

2227
02:24:47,362 --> 02:24:51,182
"How do you mean, forgotten?" I said.

2228
02:24:51,182 --> 02:24:54,742
"Forgotten whether it's the twentieth or the twenty-first, or what?

2229
02:24:54,742 --> 02:24:55,862
How near do you get to it?"

2230
02:24:55,862 --> 02:25:01,752
"I know it came somewhere between the first of January and the thirty-first of

2231
02:25:01,752 --> 02:25:04,262
December. That's how near I get to it."

2232
02:25:04,262 --> 02:25:07,822
"Think."

2233
02:25:07,822 --> 02:25:10,522
"Think? What's the use of saying 'Think'?

2234
02:25:10,522 --> 02:25:14,822
Think I haven't thought? I've been knocking sparks out of my brain

2235
02:25:14,822 --> 02:25:17,102
ever since I opened that letter."

2236
02:25:17,102 --> 02:25:18,822
"And you can't remember?" "No."

2237
02:25:18,822 --> 02:25:23,072
I rang the bell and ordered restoratives.

2238
02:25:23,072 --> 02:25:28,372
"Well, Bobbie," I said, "it's a pretty hard case to spring on an untrained amateur like

2239
02:25:28,372 --> 02:25:30,182
me.

2240
02:25:30,182 --> 02:25:35,012
Suppose someone had come to Sherlock Holmes and said, 'Mr. Holmes, here's a case for

2241
02:25:35,012 --> 02:25:38,362
you. When is my wife's birthday?'

2242
02:25:38,362 --> 02:25:40,682
Wouldn't that have given Sherlock a jolt?

2243
02:25:40,682 --> 02:25:44,902
However, I know enough about the game to understand that a fellow can't shoot off

2244
02:25:44,902 --> 02:25:49,792
his deductive theories unless you start him with a clue, so rouse yourself out of that

2245
02:25:49,792 --> 02:25:53,042
pop-eyed trance and come across with two or three.

2246
02:25:53,042 --> 02:25:56,452
For instance, can't you remember the last time she had a birthday?

2247
02:25:56,452 --> 02:25:58,382
What sort of weather was it?

2248
02:25:58,382 --> 02:26:02,632
That might fix the month." Bobbie shook his head.

2249
02:26:02,632 --> 02:26:06,142
"It was just ordinary weather, as near as I can recollect."

2250
02:26:06,142 --> 02:26:07,522
"Warm?"

2251
02:26:07,522 --> 02:26:10,322
"Warmish." "Or cold?"

2252
02:26:10,322 --> 02:26:16,702
"Well, fairly cold, perhaps. I can't remember."

2253
02:26:16,702 --> 02:26:19,092
I ordered two more of the same.

2254
02:26:19,092 --> 02:26:22,142
They seemed indicated in the Young Detective's Manual.

2255
02:26:22,142 --> 02:26:27,972
"You're a great help, Bobbie," I said. "An invaluable assistant.

2256
02:26:27,972 --> 02:26:33,772
One of those indispensable adjuncts without which no home is complete."

2257
02:26:33,772 --> 02:26:38,312
Bobbie seemed to be thinking. "I've got it," he said suddenly.

2258
02:26:38,312 --> 02:26:39,252
"Look here.

2259
02:26:39,252 --> 02:26:44,322
I gave her a present on her last birthday. All we have to do is to go to the shop,

2260
02:26:44,322 --> 02:26:48,882
hunt up the date when it was bought, and the thing's done."

2261
02:26:48,882 --> 02:26:49,092
"Absolutely.

2262
02:26:49,092 --> 02:26:52,422
What did you give her?" He sagged.

2263
02:26:52,422 --> 02:26:59,092
"I can't remember," he said. Getting ideas is like golf.

2264
02:26:59,092 --> 02:27:04,602
Some days you're right off, others it's as easy as falling off a log.

2265
02:27:04,602 --> 02:27:09,522
I don't suppose dear old Bobbie had ever had two ideas in the same morning before in

2266
02:27:09,522 --> 02:27:13,402
his life; but now he did it without an effort.

2267
02:27:13,402 --> 02:27:17,912
He just loosed another dry Martini into the undergrowth, and before you could turn

2268
02:27:17,912 --> 02:27:23,752
round it had flushed quite a brain-wave. Do you know those little books called When

2269
02:27:23,752 --> 02:27:25,082
were you Born?

2270
02:27:25,082 --> 02:27:29,452
There's one for each month. They tell you your character, your talents,

2271
02:27:29,452 --> 02:27:34,082
your strong points, and your weak points at fourpence halfpenny a go.

2272
02:27:34,082 --> 02:27:38,852
Bobbie's idea was to buy the whole twelve, and go through them till we found out which

2273
02:27:38,852 --> 02:27:43,022
month hit off Mary's character. That would give us the month, and narrow it

2274
02:27:43,022 --> 02:27:45,592
down a whole lot.

2275
02:27:45,592 --> 02:27:49,232
A pretty hot idea for a non-thinker like dear old Bobbie.

2276
02:27:49,232 --> 02:27:53,932
We sallied out at once. He took half and I took half, and we

2277
02:27:53,932 --> 02:27:55,822
settled down to work.

2278
02:27:55,822 --> 02:28:00,492
As I say, it sounded good. But when we came to go into the thing, we

2279
02:28:00,492 --> 02:28:02,762
saw that there was a flaw.

2280
02:28:02,762 --> 02:28:07,222
There was plenty of information all right, but there wasn't a single month that didn't

2281
02:28:07,222 --> 02:28:10,412
have something that exactly hit off Mary.

2282
02:28:10,412 --> 02:28:15,612
For instance, in the December book it said, "December people are apt to keep their own

2283
02:28:15,612 --> 02:28:19,252
secrets. They are extensive travellers."

2284
02:28:19,252 --> 02:28:24,232
Well, Mary had certainly kept her secret, and she had travelled quite extensively

2285
02:28:24,232 --> 02:28:28,672
enough for Bobbie's needs. Then, October people were "born with

2286
02:28:28,672 --> 02:28:31,922
original ideas" and "loved moving."

2287
02:28:31,922 --> 02:28:35,042
You couldn't have summed up Mary's little jaunt more neatly.

2288
02:28:35,042 --> 02:28:40,682
February people had "wonderful memories"-- Mary's speciality.

2289
02:28:40,682 --> 02:28:43,602
We took a bit of a rest, then had another go at the thing.

2290
02:28:43,602 --> 02:28:49,272
Bobbie was all for May, because the book said that women born in that month were

2291
02:28:49,272 --> 02:28:55,212
"inclined to be capricious, which is always a barrier to a happy married life"; but I

2292
02:28:55,212 --> 02:28:57,962
plumped for February, because February

2293
02:28:57,962 --> 02:29:03,472
women "are unusually determined to have their own way, are very earnest, and expect

2294
02:29:03,472 --> 02:29:09,082
a full return in their companion or mates." Which he owned was about as like Mary as

2295
02:29:09,082 --> 02:29:11,382
anything could be.

2296
02:29:11,382 --> 02:29:16,662
In the end he tore the books up, stamped on them, burnt them, and went home.

2297
02:29:16,662 --> 02:29:22,062
It was wonderful what a change the next few days made in dear old Bobbie.

2298
02:29:22,062 --> 02:29:25,012
Have you ever seen that picture, "The Soul's Awakening"?

2299
02:29:25,012 --> 02:29:30,252
It represents a flapper of sorts gazing in a startled sort of way into the middle

2300
02:29:30,252 --> 02:29:35,432
distance with a look in her eyes that seems to say, "Surely that is George's step I

2301
02:29:35,432 --> 02:29:36,712
hear on the mat!

2302
02:29:36,712 --> 02:29:42,282
Can this be love?" Well, Bobbie had a soul's awakening too.

2303
02:29:42,282 --> 02:29:48,222
I don't suppose he had ever troubled to think in his life before--not really think.

2304
02:29:48,222 --> 02:29:51,312
But now he was wearing his brain to the bone.

2305
02:29:51,312 --> 02:29:56,222
It was painful in a way, of course, to see a fellow human being so thoroughly in the

2306
02:29:56,222 --> 02:30:00,122
soup, but I felt strongly that it was all for the best.

2307
02:30:00,122 --> 02:30:05,532
I could see as plainly as possible that all these brainstorms were improving Bobbie out

2308
02:30:05,532 --> 02:30:06,662
of knowledge.

2309
02:30:06,662 --> 02:30:11,222
When it was all over he might possibly become a rotter again of a sort, but it

2310
02:30:11,222 --> 02:30:15,032
would only be a pale reflection of the rotter he had been.

2311
02:30:15,032 --> 02:30:21,352
It bore out the idea I had always had that what he needed was a real good jolt.

2312
02:30:21,352 --> 02:30:26,292
I saw a great deal of him these days. I was his best friend, and he came to me

2313
02:30:26,292 --> 02:30:27,682
for sympathy.

2314
02:30:27,682 --> 02:30:33,192
I gave it him, too, with both hands, but I never failed to hand him the Moral Lesson

2315
02:30:33,192 --> 02:30:35,132
when I had him weak.

2316
02:30:35,132 --> 02:30:39,452
One day he came to me as I was sitting in the club, and I could see that he had had

2317
02:30:39,452 --> 02:30:42,372
an idea. He looked happier than he had done in

2318
02:30:42,372 --> 02:30:44,662
weeks.

2319
02:30:44,662 --> 02:30:49,922
"Reggie," he said, "I'm on the trail. This time I'm convinced that I shall pull

2320
02:30:49,922 --> 02:30:52,832
it off. I've remembered something of vital

2321
02:30:52,832 --> 02:30:54,322
importance."

2322
02:30:54,322 --> 02:30:55,512
"Yes?" I said.

2323
02:30:55,512 --> 02:31:01,752
"I remember distinctly," he said, "that on Mary's last birthday we went together to

2324
02:31:01,752 --> 02:31:03,082
the Coliseum.

2325
02:31:03,082 --> 02:31:07,672
How does that hit you?" "It's a fine bit of memorizing," I said;

2326
02:31:07,672 --> 02:31:11,782
"but how does it help?" "Why, they change the programme every week

2327
02:31:11,782 --> 02:31:12,722
there."

2328
02:31:12,722 --> 02:31:14,122
"Ah!" I said.

2329
02:31:14,122 --> 02:31:18,802
"Now you are talking." "And the week we went one of the turns was

2330
02:31:18,802 --> 02:31:22,572
Professor Some One's Terpsichorean Cats.

2331
02:31:22,572 --> 02:31:27,292
I recollect them distinctly. Now, are we narrowing it down, or aren't

2332
02:31:27,292 --> 02:31:27,432
we?

2333
02:31:27,432 --> 02:31:32,092
Reggie, I'm going round to the Coliseum this minute, and I'm going to dig the date

2334
02:31:32,092 --> 02:31:37,282
of those Terpsichorean Cats out of them, if I have to use a crowbar."

2335
02:31:37,282 --> 02:31:42,162
So that got him within six days; for the management treated us like brothers;

2336
02:31:42,162 --> 02:31:46,432
brought out the archives, and ran agile fingers over the pages till they treed the

2337
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:48,992
cats in the middle of May.

2338
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:53,272
"I told you it was May," said Bobbie. "Maybe you'll listen to me another time."

2339
02:31:53,272 --> 02:31:58,572
"If you've any sense," I said, "there won't be another time."

2340
02:31:58,572 --> 02:32:00,832
And Bobbie said that there wouldn't.

2341
02:32:00,832 --> 02:32:05,572
Once you get your money on the run, it parts as if it enjoyed doing it.

2342
02:32:05,572 --> 02:32:09,562
I had just got off to sleep that night when my telephone-bell rang.

2343
02:32:09,562 --> 02:32:11,382
It was Bobbie, of course.

2344
02:32:11,382 --> 02:32:15,772
He didn't apologize. "Reggie," he said, "I've got it now for

2345
02:32:15,772 --> 02:32:18,042
certain. It's just come to me.

2346
02:32:18,042 --> 02:32:22,092
We saw those Terpsichorean Cats at a matinee, old man."

2347
02:32:22,092 --> 02:32:23,682
"Yes?" I said.

2348
02:32:23,682 --> 02:32:27,142
"Well, don't you see that that brings it down to two days?

2349
02:32:27,142 --> 02:32:32,062
It must have been either Wednesday the seventh or Saturday the tenth."

2350
02:32:32,062 --> 02:32:36,532
"Yes," I said, "if they didn't have daily matinees at the Coliseum."

2351
02:32:36,532 --> 02:32:40,532
I heard him give a sort of howl. "Bobbie," I said.

2352
02:32:40,532 --> 02:32:43,332
My feet were freezing, but I was fond of him.

2353
02:32:43,332 --> 02:32:46,672
"Well?" "I've remembered something too.

2354
02:32:46,672 --> 02:32:48,132
It's this.

2355
02:32:48,132 --> 02:32:52,302
The day you went to the Coliseum I lunched with you both at the Ritz.

2356
02:32:52,302 --> 02:32:56,452
You had forgotten to bring any money with you, so you wrote a cheque."

2357
02:32:56,452 --> 02:32:59,432
"But I'm always writing cheques."

2358
02:32:59,432 --> 02:33:02,532
"You are. But this was for a tenner, and made out to

2359
02:33:02,532 --> 02:33:03,662
the hotel.

2360
02:33:03,662 --> 02:33:08,022
Hunt up your cheque-book and see how many cheques for ten pounds payable to the Ritz

2361
02:33:08,022 --> 02:33:11,862
Hotel you wrote out between May the fifth and May the tenth."

2362
02:33:11,862 --> 02:33:13,972
He gave a kind of gulp.

2363
02:33:13,972 --> 02:33:18,192
"Reggie," he said, "you're a genius. I've always said so.

2364
02:33:18,192 --> 02:33:21,452
I believe you've got it. Hold the line."

2365
02:33:21,452 --> 02:33:22,432
Presently he came back again.

2366
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:26,662
"Halloa!" he said. "I'm here," I said.

2367
02:33:26,662 --> 02:33:29,752
"It was the eighth. Reggie, old man, I----"

2368
02:33:29,752 --> 02:33:30,962
"Topping," I said.

2369
02:33:30,962 --> 02:33:34,402
"Good night." It was working along into the small hours

2370
02:33:34,402 --> 02:33:38,882
now, but I thought I might as well make a night of it and finish the thing up, so I

2371
02:33:38,882 --> 02:33:42,272
rang up an hotel near the Strand.

2372
02:33:42,272 --> 02:33:47,692
"Put me through to Mrs. Cardew," I said. "It's late," said the man at the other end.

2373
02:33:47,692 --> 02:33:50,812
"And getting later every minute," I said. "Buck along, laddie."

2374
02:33:50,812 --> 02:33:54,332
I waited patiently.

2375
02:33:54,332 --> 02:34:00,632
I had missed my beauty-sleep, and my feet had frozen hard, but I was past regrets.

2376
02:34:00,632 --> 02:34:04,792
"What is the matter?" said Mary's voice. "My feet are cold," I said.

2377
02:34:04,792 --> 02:34:07,582
"But I didn't call you up to tell you that particularly.

2378
02:34:07,582 --> 02:34:10,792
I've just been chatting with Bobbie, Mrs. Cardew."

2379
02:34:10,792 --> 02:34:13,212
"Oh! is that Mr. Pepper?"

2380
02:34:13,212 --> 02:34:17,762
"Yes. He's remembered it, Mrs. Cardew."

2381
02:34:17,762 --> 02:34:22,012
She gave a sort of scream. I've often thought how interesting it must

2382
02:34:22,012 --> 02:34:24,462
be to be one of those Exchange girls.

2383
02:34:24,462 --> 02:34:29,832
The things they must hear, don't you know. Bobbie's howl and gulp and Mrs. Bobbie's

2384
02:34:29,832 --> 02:34:33,762
scream and all about my feet and all that. Most interesting it must be.

2385
02:34:33,762 --> 02:34:36,702
"He's remembered it!" she gasped.

2386
02:34:36,702 --> 02:34:40,022
"Did you tell him?" "No."

2387
02:34:40,022 --> 02:34:42,432
Well, I hadn't. "Mr. Pepper."

2388
02:34:42,432 --> 02:34:43,792
"Yes?"

2389
02:34:43,792 --> 02:34:49,592
"Was he--has he been--was he very worried?" I chuckled.

2390
02:34:49,592 --> 02:34:52,422
This was where I was billed to be the life and soul of the party.

2391
02:34:52,422 --> 02:34:54,502
"Worried!

2392
02:34:54,502 --> 02:34:58,282
He was about the most worried man between here and Edinburgh.

2393
02:34:58,282 --> 02:35:02,012
He has been worrying as if he was paid to do it by the nation.

2394
02:35:02,012 --> 02:35:05,002
He has started out to worry after breakfast, and----"

2395
02:35:05,002 --> 02:35:08,532
Oh, well, you can never tell with women.

2396
02:35:08,532 --> 02:35:12,582
My idea was that we should pass the rest of the night slapping each other on the back

2397
02:35:12,582 --> 02:35:16,892
across the wire, and telling each other what bally brainy conspirators we were,

2398
02:35:16,892 --> 02:35:19,032
don't you know, and all that.

2399
02:35:19,032 --> 02:35:22,792
But I'd got just as far as this, when she bit at me.

2400
02:35:22,792 --> 02:35:25,172
Absolutely! I heard the snap.

2401
02:35:25,172 --> 02:35:28,682
And then she said "Oh!" in that choked kind of way.

2402
02:35:28,682 --> 02:35:34,692
And when a woman says "Oh!" like that, it means all the bad words she'd love to say

2403
02:35:34,692 --> 02:35:37,052
if she only knew them.

2404
02:35:37,052 --> 02:35:40,972
And then she began. "What brutes men are!

2405
02:35:40,972 --> 02:35:42,012
What horrid brutes!

2406
02:35:42,012 --> 02:35:47,832
How you could stand by and see poor dear Bobbie worrying himself into a fever, when

2407
02:35:47,832 --> 02:35:51,692
a word from you would have put everything right, I can't----"

2408
02:35:51,692 --> 02:35:52,062
"But----"

2409
02:35:52,062 --> 02:35:55,782
"And you call yourself his friend! His friend!"

2410
02:35:55,782 --> 02:36:01,292
(Metallic laugh, most unpleasant.) "It shows how one can be deceived.

2411
02:36:01,292 --> 02:36:04,322
I used to think you a kind-hearted man."

2412
02:36:04,322 --> 02:36:08,262
"But, I say, when I suggested the thing, you thought it perfectly----"

2413
02:36:08,262 --> 02:36:13,742
"I thought it hateful, abominable." "But you said it was absolutely top----"

2414
02:36:13,742 --> 02:36:15,472
"I said nothing of the kind.

2415
02:36:15,472 --> 02:36:18,592
And if I did, I didn't mean it.

2416
02:36:18,592 --> 02:36:23,082
I don't wish to be unjust, Mr. Pepper, but I must say that to me there seems to be

2417
02:36:23,082 --> 02:36:27,722
something positively fiendish in a man who can go out of his way to separate a husband

2418
02:36:27,722 --> 02:36:32,532
from his wife, simply in order to amuse himself by gloating over his agony----"

2419
02:36:32,532 --> 02:36:35,402
"But----!" "When one single word would have----"

2420
02:36:35,402 --> 02:36:38,542
"But you made me promise not to----" I bleated.

2421
02:36:38,542 --> 02:36:43,002
"And if I did, do you suppose I didn't expect you to have the sense to break your

2422
02:36:43,002 --> 02:36:44,622
promise?"

2423
02:36:44,622 --> 02:36:48,922
I had finished. I had no further observations to make.

2424
02:36:48,922 --> 02:36:52,642
I hung up the receiver, and crawled into bed.

2425
02:36:52,642 --> 02:36:58,162
I still see Bobbie when he comes to the club, but I do not visit the old homestead.

2426
02:36:58,162 --> 02:37:02,712
He is friendly, but he stops short of issuing invitations.

2427
02:37:02,712 --> 02:37:07,562
I ran across Mary at the Academy last week, and her eyes went through me like a couple

2428
02:37:07,562 --> 02:37:09,662
of bullets through a pat of butter.

2429
02:37:09,662 --> 02:37:15,042
And as they came out the other side, and I limped off to piece myself together again,

2430
02:37:15,042 --> 02:37:19,832
there occurred to me the simple epitaph which, when I am no more, I intend to have

2431
02:37:19,832 --> 02:37:22,012
inscribed on my tombstone.

2432
02:37:22,012 --> 02:37:26,762
It was this: "He was a man who acted from the best motives.

2433
02:37:26,762 --> 02:37:34,196
There is one born every minute."

2434
02:37:34,196 --> 99:59:59,999

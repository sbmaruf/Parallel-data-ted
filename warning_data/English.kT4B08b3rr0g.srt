1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,890
On February 2, 2010 the U.S.
Treasury estimated the

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,900
national debt at 1.2278 times
10 to the 13th power.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,930
And just to get a sense of
things, 1 times 10 to the

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,330
sixth is a million, 1 times 10
to the ninth is a billion, 1

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,470
times 10 to the 12th
is a trillion.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,450
So we're talking on the
order of magnitude

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,210
of 10 trillion dollars.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,470
So this is about 12
trillion dollars.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,970
Then they tell us that the U.S.
Census Bureau's estimate

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,390
for the U.S. population was
about 3.086 times 10 to the

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,100
eighth power.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,875
So this is a little over
300 million people.

13
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,900
So that's an interesting number
right there, it's the

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,870
population.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,510
And then they say, using these
estimates calculate the

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,400
per-person share of
the national debt.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,840
So essentially, we want to
take the entire debt and

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,450
divide by the number
of people.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,850
That'll give us the per-person
share of the national debt.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,320
Use scientific notation to make
your calculations and

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,630
express your answer in both

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,710
scientific and decimal notation.

23
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,860
Which means just as
a regular number.

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,410
Round to four decimal places
while making calculations.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,990
So we want the per-person
debt.

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,430
So we want to take the total
debt and divide by

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,050
the number of people.

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:26,270
So the total debt is 1.2278
times 10 to the 13th.

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,610
And we want to divide that by
the total number of people,

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,660
which is 3.086 times
10 to the eighth.

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,160
And we could separate this into
two division problems. We

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,070
could say that this is equal
to the division right here,

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:56,310
1.2278 divided by 3.086.

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,630
And then times 10 to the 13th
divided by 10 to the eighth.

35
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,280
Now, what's 10 to the 13th
divided by 10 to the eighth?

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,530
Let me do it over here.

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,590
The way I think about it, this
is the exact same thing as 10

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,860
to the 13th times 10 to
the negative eight.

39
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,530
This is an eight right here.

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,610
If you have a 10 to the eighth
in the denominator, that's

41
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,870
like multiplying by 10 to
the negative eight.

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,660
So you have 13, you the same
base 10, so 10 to the 13th

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,770
times 10 to the negative eight
is going to be 10 to

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,390
the 13 minus 8.

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,070
Which is 10 to the fifth.

46
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,910
Or another way to think about
it: If you have the base in

47
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,880
the denominator, you subtract
the exponents.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,190
So it's 13 minus 8.

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,420
10 to the fifth.

50
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:52,360
So it's this blue expression
times 10 to the fifth.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,240
And let's get a calculator out
to calculate this right here.

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,985
And they say round everything
to four decimal places, so

53
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:02,550
I'll keep that in mind.

54
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,720
Let me turn my calculator on.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:22,760
1.2278 divided by 3.086
is equal to 0.3979.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,020
Because we want to round
right there.

57
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,005
Let me remember that.

58
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,780
Or let me just put it
on the side so I can

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,020
still look at it.

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,810
So this this little
dividing decimals

61
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:44,840
problem results in 0.3979.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,510
And of course, times 10 to the
fifth dollars per person.

63
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,640
Once again, you might be tempted
to say, hey this is in

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,590
scientific notation.

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,760
I have some number times
a power of ten.

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,250
But notice, this number is not
greater than or equal to 1.

67
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,010
Remember, this number, if you
want to be formal about

68
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,260
scientific notation, has to be
greater than or equal to 1, or

69
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,770
less than 10.

70
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,020
So what we can do here
is we can multiply.

71
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,580
If we don't want to change the
number, we can multiply this

72
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,630
number by 10 and divide
this number by 10.

73
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,209
Or another way you can think
about it is, this whole thing

74
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:26,180
can be rewritten as
0.3979 times 10

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,110
times 10 to the fourth.

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,510
What I did was just now was I
broke up the 10 of the fifth

77
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,710
into a 10 and a 10
to the fourth.

78
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,120
And I did that because I want
to multiply this by 10 so I

79
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,250
can get a 3 out front
instead of a 0.3.

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,370
So let's do that.

81
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,400
So essentially, I took a 10 out
of the 10 to the fifth.

82
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,690
I divided it by 10, I multiplied
this other guy by

83
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,670
10, not changing the
whole number.

84
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:57,840
So then this right here will
become 3.979 and then times 10

85
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,090
to the fourth.

86
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,630
So that's how much debt
there is per-person

87
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,140
in scientific notation.

88
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,240
Now, in the problem they also
wanted us to express it in

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,700
decimal notation.

90
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,420
Which is just kind of standard
writing it as a number with

91
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,080
our standard numeric
decimal system.

92
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,100
So what is 3.979 times
10 to the fourth?

93
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,350
Let's think about it.

94
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,830
Well let me just
do it this way.

95
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,670
Let's just move the
decimal space.

96
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,910
If we multiply it by 10, we're
going to get 39.79.

97
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,590
If we multiply it by
10 squared, we're

98
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,335
going to get 397.9.

99
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:47,250
If we multiply it by 10
to the third, we're

100
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,655
going to get 3,979.

101
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:53,020
If we multiply it by 10 to the
fourth, we're going to get one

102
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,340
more zero right there.

103
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,320
So we're essentially
going to move the

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
decimal four to the right.

105
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,950
So I could write it like this.

106
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,620
This is equal to $39,970.

107
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,000
So if you think about the
national debt per person.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,070
Every man, woman, and child in
the United States essentially

109
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,860
owes $39,970.

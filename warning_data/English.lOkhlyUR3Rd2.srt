1
00:00:00,575 --> 00:00:04,525
Patani students campaign for peace on the International Day of Peace.

2
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:19,996
On the international Day of Peace

3
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:27,154
this is a small campaign by members of 
Thailand's Federation of Southern Students.

4
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:30,822
They come together to campaign for peace.

5
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,646
We will display our cards of words.

6
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:39,674
To let people suggest 
what peace means for each of them.

7
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,821
I've seen what the students do today,

8
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:00,714
of their activities for peace.

9
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,023
They suggest peaceful solution

10
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:05,783
to the conflict and violence 
in the three southern provinces

11
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:10,666
I myself have joined a campaign group
for peace in the south.

12
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:15,753
This is therefor something
I'd like to see students participate.

13
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,558
Because part of the problem

14
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:22,239
comes from some young people and students.

15
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:26,566
If they join this campaign, 
it will offer us the best way-out.

16
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,543
Peace for me means no problem.

17
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:51,819
But of course, there's no society 
without problem.

18
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,759
What we have to do is to try 
to reduce the problem as best we can.

19
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:59,933
When it happens, peace begins. 
It begins when we respect each others.

20
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:03,531
Peace begins 
when we understand each others.

21
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:16,334
I think this is good,
that we let people express themselves.

22
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:20,285
They can tell us how they think of peace.

23
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,979
When we don't have a chance like this,

24
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:27,689
we could forget peace 
or that such word exists.

25
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:50,728
Today is the International Day of Peace.

26
00:02:51,963 --> 00:03:01,313
I am one of those people 
who want global peace.

27
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,795
Especially in the three southern provinces.

28
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:16,351
May God protect us and give us, 
people in the south, peace,

29
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,559
which we've been deprived of 
for many years.

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,367
The government should understand that

31
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:26,418
we are under the law which is not 
by international standard.

32
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:36,896
I'd like the government to consider this
as well as peace.

33
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,152
Patani wants peace.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000

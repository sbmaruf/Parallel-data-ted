1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,140
We're asked to solve
the proportion.

3
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,290
We have 8 36ths is
equal to 10 over what.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,584
Or the ratio of 8/36 is equal
to the ratio of 10 to what.

5
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,750
And there's a bunch of
different ways to solve this.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,540
And I'll explore
really all of them,

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,810
or a good selection of them.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,900
So one way to think about
it is, these two need

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,460
to be equivalent ratios, or
really, equivalent fractions.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,240
So whatever happened
to the numerator also

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,420
has to happen to
the denominator.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,400
So what do we have to
multiply 8 by to get 10?

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,560
Well you could
multiply 8 times 10/8.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,660
It will definitely give you 10.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,340
So we're multiplying
by 10/8 over here.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,340
Or another way to write 10/8,
10/8 is the same thing as 5/4.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,417
So we're multiplying by 5/4
to get to 10, from 8 to 10.

18
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, if we did that
to the numerator,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,270
in order to have an
equivalent fraction,

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,440
you have to do the same
thing to the denominator.

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,100
You have to multiply it.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,030
You have to multiply
it times 5/4.

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,110
And so we could say this n, this
thing that we just solved for,

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,202
this n is going to be equal
to 36 times 5 divided by 4.

25
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,660
Or you could say
that this is going

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,080
to be equal to 36
times 5 divided by 4.

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,340
And now, 36 divided by
4, we know what that is.

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,640
We could divide both the
numerator and the denominator

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,410
by 4.

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,660
You divide the numerator
by 4, you get 9.

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,950
Divide the denominator
by 4 you get 1.

32
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,991
You get 45.

33
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,490
So that's one way
to think about it.

34
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,575
8/36 is equal to 10/45.

35
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:35,190

36
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,910
Another way to
think about it is,

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,750
what do we have to multiply
8 by to get its denominator.

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,300
How much larger is the
denominator 36 than 8?

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,540
Well let's just divide 36/8.

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,170
So 36/8 is the same
thing as-- so we

41
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,580
can simplify, dividing the
numerator and the denominator

42
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,320
by 4.

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,170
That's the greatest
common divisor.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,480
That's the same thing as 9/2.

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,080
So if you multiply
the numerator by 9/2,

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,640
you get the denominator.

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,527
So we're multiplying by 9/2 to
get the denominator over here.

48
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,610
Well, then we have to do
the same thing over here.

49
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,510
If 36 is 9/2 times
8, let me write this.

50
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:24,480
8 times 9/2 is equal to 36.

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,980
Right?

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
That's how we go from the
numerator to the denominator.

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,790
Then to figure out what
the denominator here

54
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,165
is, if we want
the same fraction,

55
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:33,320
we have to multiply
by 9/2 again.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,880
So then we'll get 10 times
9/2 is going to be equal to n,

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,290
is going to be equal
to this denominator.

58
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,474
And so this is the same
thing as saying 10 times 9/2.

59
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:48,390
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2,

60
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,170
you get 5/1, which is 45.

61
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,480
So 45 is equal to n.

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,880
Once again, we got the same
way, completely legitimate way,

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,180
to solve it.

64
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,990
Now sometimes when you
see proportion like this,

65
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,045
sometimes people say, oh
you can cross-multiply.

66
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:06,170
And you can cross-multiply.

67
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,690
And I'll teach you
how to do that.

68
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,570
And that's sometimes
a quick way to do it.

69
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,389
But I don't like teaching
it the first time you

70
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,680
look at proportions, because
it's really just something

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,260
mechanical.

72
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,610
You really don't understand
what you're doing.

73
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,590
And it really comes out of
a little bit of algebra.

74
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,190
And I'll show you
the algebra as well.

75
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,330
But if you don't
understand it, or if it

76
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,329
doesn't make as much sense
to you at this point,

77
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,060
don't worry too much about it.

78
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,860
So we have 8/36
is equal to 10/n.

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,780
When you cross-multiply,
you're saying

80
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,990
that the numerator here, times
the denominator over here,

81
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,600
is going to be equal
to, so 8 times n,

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,060
is going to be equal to
the denominator over here,

83
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,170
let me just different color,
the denominator over here,

84
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,420
times the numerator over here.

85
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,190
This is what it means
to cross-multiply.

86
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,760
So this is going to be
equal to 36 times 10.

87
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,350

88
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,690
Let me do this in a
neutral color now.

89
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,840
You could say that
8n is equal to 360.

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,390
And so you're saying 8
times what is equal to 360.

91
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,090
Or to figure out
what that times what

92
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,339
is, you divide 360 divided by 8.

93
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,880
So we could divide, and this is
a little bit of algebra here,

94
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,529
we're dividing both sides
of the equation by 8.

95
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,574
And we're getting n is
equal to 360 divided by 8.

96
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:21,990
You could do that
without thinking

97
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,730
in strict algebraic terms.

98
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,090
You could say 8
times what is 360.

99
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,980
Well 8 times 360/8.

100
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,620
If I write 8 times question
mark is equal to 360,

101
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,230
well, question mark could
definitely be 360/8.

102
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,890
If I multiply these out, this
guy and that guy cancel out,

103
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,060
and it's definitely 360.

104
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,884
And that's why it's 360/8.

105
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,300
But now we want
to actually divide

106
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,690
this to actually get our right
answer, or a simplified answer.

107
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,390
8 goes into 360, 8 goes into
36 4 times, 4 times 8 is 32.

108
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,920
You have a remainder of 4.

109
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,210
Bring down the 0.

110
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,300
8 goes into 40 5 times.

111
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,430
5 times 8 is 40.

112
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,444
And then you have no remainder.

113
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:06,110
And you're done.

114
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,404
Once again, we got
n is equal to 45.

115
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,070
Now the last thing
I'm going to show you

116
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,740
involves a little
bit of algebra.

117
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,990
If any of the ways before
this worked, that's fine.

118
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,590
And where this is
sitting in the playlist,

119
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,280
you're not expected
to know the algebra.

120
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,070
But I want to show
you the algebra just

121
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,528
because I wanted to show you
that this cross-multiplication

122
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,380
isn't some magic,
that using algebra,

123
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,450
we will get this
exact same thing.

124
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,930
But you could stop
watching this,

125
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,280
if you'll find this
part confusing.

126
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,340
So let's rewrite our proportion,
8/36 is equal to 10/n.

127
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,860

128
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,390
And we want to solve for n.

129
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,912
Well the easiest way to solve
for n is maybe multiply both--

130
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:49,370
this thing on the left is equal
to this thing on the right.

131
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,910
So we can multiply them
both by the same thing.

132
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,500
And the equality
will still hold.

133
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,950
So we could multiply
both of them by n.

134
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,080
On the right-hand side,
the n's cancel out.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,220
On the left-hand side, we have
8/36 times n is equal to 10.

136
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,150
Now if we want to solve for n,
we could literally multiply.

137
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,920
If we want just an
n here, we would

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,775
want to multiply
this side times 36--

139
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,350
I'll do that in a
different color--

140
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,960
we'd want to multiply this
side times 36 times 8,

141
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,510
because if you multiply
these guys out, you get 1.

142
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,820
And you just have an n.

143
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,778
But since we're doing it
to the left-hand side,

144
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:32,170
we also have to do it to the
right-hand side, so times 36/8.

145
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,330
These guys cancel out
and we're left with n

146
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,480
is equal to 10
times 36 is 360/8.

147
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,410
And notice, we're getting
the exact same value

148
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,220
that we got with
cross-multiplying.

149
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,160
And with
cross-multiplying, you're

150
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,500
actually doing two steps.

151
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,250
Actually, you're doing
an extra step here.

152
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,540
You're multiplying both sides
by n, so that you had your 8n.

153
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,110
And then you're multiplying
both sides by 36,

154
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,510
so that you get your
36 on both sides.

155
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,740
And you get this value here.

156
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,281
But at the end, when
you simplify it,

157
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,330
you'll get the
exact same answer.

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,930
So those are all different
ways to solve this proportion.

159
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,340
Probably the most obvious
way, or the easiest way

160
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,345
to do it in your head,
was either just looking

161
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:14,220
at what you have to
multiply the numerator by

162
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,830
and then doing the same
thing to the denominator,

163
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,332
or maybe by
cross-multiplication.

164
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:19,831

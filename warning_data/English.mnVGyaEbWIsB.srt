1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,045
This triangle that we have right
over here is a right triangle.

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,600
And it's a right triangle
because it has a 90 degree

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,240
angle, or has a
right angle in it.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,520
Now, we call the longest
side of a right triangle,

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,599
we call that side,
and you could either

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,140
view it as the longest side of
the right triangle or the side

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,980
opposite the 90 degree angle,
it is called a hypotenuse.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,740
It's a very fancy word
for a fairly simple idea,

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,140
just the longest side of a
right triangle or the side

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,542
opposite the 90 degree angle.

12
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,500
And it's just good to
know that because someone

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,090
might say hypotenuse.

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,548
You're like, oh, they're just
talking about this side right

15
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:36,580
here, the side longest, the side
opposite the 90 degree angle.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,860
Now, what I want
to do in this video

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,167
is prove a relationship, a
very famous relationship.

18
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,750
And you might see
where this is going.

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,370
A very famous relationship
between the lengths

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,840
of the sides of
a right triangle.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,210
So let's say that the length of
AC, so uppercase A, uppercase

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,930
C, let's call that
length lowercase a.

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,040
Let's call the length of BC
lowercase b right over here.

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,420
I'll use uppercases for
points, lowercases for lengths.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,630
And let's call the length of the
hypotenuse, the length of AB,

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,822
let's call that c.

27
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:10,030
And let's see if we can come
up with the relationship

28
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,790
between a, b, and c.

29
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,780
And to do that I'm
first going to construct

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,410
another line or
another segment, I

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,520
should say, between
c and the hypotenuse.

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
And I'm going to
construct it so that they

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,880
intersect at a right angle.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,006
And you can always do that.

35
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,005
And we'll call this point
right over here we'll.

36
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,120
Call this point capital D.

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,010
And if you're wondering,
how can you always do that?

38
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,634
You could imagine rotating
this entire triangle like this.

39
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,050
This isn't a rigorous proof,
but it just kind of gives you

40
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,100
the general idea of
how you can always

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,810
construct a point like this.

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,260
So if I've rotated it around.

43
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,750
So now our hypotenuse, we're
now sitting on our hypotenuse.

44
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,414
This is now point
B, this is point A.

45
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:50,580
So we've rotated the whole
thing all the way around.

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,710
This is point C. You
could imagine just

47
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,820
dropping a rock from point C,
maybe with a string attached,

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,460
and it would hit the
hypotenuse at a right angle.

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,980
So that's all we did here to
establish segment CD into where

50
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,570
we put our point D
right over there.

51
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,220
And the reason why
did that is now we

52
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,289
can do all sorts of
interesting relationships

53
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,490
between similar triangles.

54
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,180
Because we have
three triangles here.

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,604
We have triangle ADC,
we have triangle DBC,

56
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:17,520
and then we have the
larger original triangle.

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,890
And we can hopefully
establish similarity

58
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,980
between those triangles.

59
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,590
And first I'll show you that ADC
is similar to the larger one.

60
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,710
Because both of them
have a right angle.

61
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,070
ADC has a right angle
right over here.

62
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,571
Clearly if this
angle is 90 degrees,

63
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,653
then this angle is going
to be 90 degrees as well.

64
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:36,660
They are supplementary.

65
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,510
They have to add up to 180.

66
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,440
And so they both have
a right angle in them.

67
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,060
So the smaller one
has a right angle.

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,590
The larger one clearly
has a right angle.

69
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,840
That's where we started from.

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,690
And they also both
share this angle right

71
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,150
over here, angle
DAC or BAC, however

72
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,580
you want to refer to it.

73
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,720
So we can actually write
down that triangle.

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,290
I'm going to start with
the smaller one, ADC.

75
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,190
And maybe I'll shade
it in right over here.

76
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,023
So this is the triangle
we're talking about.

77
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:05,429
Triangle ADC.

78
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:07,470
And I went from the blue
angle to the right angle

79
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,620
to the unlabeled angle from the
point of view of triangle ADC.

80
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,860
This right angle isn't applying
to that right over there.

81
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,820
It's applying to
the larger triangle.

82
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:24,820
So we could say triangle
ADC is similar to triangle--

83
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,130
once again, you want to
start at the blue angle.

84
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,500
A. Then we went to
the right angle.

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,220
So we have to go to
the right angle again.

86
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,830
So it's ACB.

87
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,190

88
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,270
And because they're
similar, we can set up

89
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,220
a relationship between
the ratios of their sides.

90
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,705
For example, we know the
ratio of corresponding sides

91
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:47,080
are going to do, well, in
general for a similar triangle,

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,640
we know the ratio of
the corresponding sides

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,890
are going to be a constant.

94
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,100
So we could take the ratio of
the hypotenuse of the smaller

95
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,960
triangle.

96
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,350
So the hypotenuse is AC.

97
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,710
So AC over the hypotenuse
over the larger one, which

98
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:10,480
is a AB, AC over AB is going
to be the same thing as AD

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,180
as one of the legs, AD.

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,959
And just to show that, I'm just
taking corresponding points

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,794
on both similar triangles,
this is AD over AC.

102
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,960
You could look at these
triangles yourself and show,

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,930
look, AD, point AD, is
between the blue angle

104
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,410
and the right angle.

105
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,760
Sorry, side AD is between the
blue angle and the right angle.

106
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,025
Side AC is between the blue
angle and the right angle

107
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,010
on the larger triangle.

108
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,950
So both of these are
from the larger triangle.

109
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,660
These are the corresponding
sides on the smaller triangle.

110
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,990
And if that is confusing
looking at them visually,

111
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,199
as long as we wrote our
similarity statement correctly,

112
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,990
you can just find the
corresponding points.

113
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,590
AC corresponds to AB
on the larger triangle,

114
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,840
AD on the smaller
triangle corresponds

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,330
to AC on the larger triangle.

116
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,920
And we know that AC, we can
rewrite that as lowercase a.

117
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,860
AC is lowercase a.

118
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,810
We don't have any
label for AD or for AB.

119
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,900
Sorry, we do have
a label for AB.

120
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,590
That is c right over here.

121
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,790
We don't have a label for AD.

122
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,840
So AD, let's just
call that lowercase d.

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,400
So lowercase d applies to
that part right over there.

124
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,560
c applies to that entire
part right over there.

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,905
And then we'll call DB,
let's call that length e.

126
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,700
That'll just make things a
little bit simpler for us.

127
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,760
So AD we'll just call d.

128
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,850
And so we have a over
c is equal to d over a.

129
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,830
If we cross multiply, you have
a times a, which is a squared,

130
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,791
is equal to c times
d, which is cd.

131
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,790
So that's a little bit
of an interesting result.

132
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,789
Let's see what we can do
with the other triangle

133
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:55,930
right over here.

134
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,940
So this triangle
right over here.

135
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,490
So once again, it
has a right angle.

136
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,865
The larger one
has a right angle.

137
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:04,270
And they both share this
angle right over here.

138
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,070
So by angle, angle
similarity, the two triangles

139
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,210
are going to be similar.

140
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,040
So we could say triangle
BDC, we went from pink

141
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,970
to right to not labeled.

142
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:20,352
So triangle BDC is
similar to triangle.

143
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:22,310
Now we're going to look
at the larger triangle,

144
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,430
we're going to start
at the pink angle.

145
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,567
B. Now we're going to
go to the right angle.

146
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,066
CA.

147
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:29,190

148
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,680
BCA.

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,979
From pink angle to right
angle to non-labeled angle,

150
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,520
at least from the
point of view here.

151
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,420
We labeled it before
with that blue.

152
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,620
So now let's set up some
type of relationship here.

153
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,040
We can say that the ratio on
the smaller triangle, BC, side

154
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,130
BC over BA, BC over
BA, once again,

155
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,230
we're taking the
hypotenuses of both of them.

156
00:06:53,230 --> 00:07:00,593
So BC over BA is going
to be equal to BD.

157
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,590
Let me do this in another color.

158
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,450
BD.

159
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,890
So this is one of the legs.

160
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,570
BD.

161
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,430
The way I drew it
is the shorter legs.

162
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,370
BD over BC.

163
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,770
I'm just taking the
corresponding vertices.

164
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,600
Over BC.

165
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,203
And once again, we know BC is
the same thing as lowercase b.

166
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,322
BC is lowercase b.

167
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:22,926
BA is lowercase c.

168
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,570

169
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,740
And then BD we defined
as lowercase e.

170
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,260
So this is lowercase e.

171
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,210
We can cross
multiply here and we

172
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,830
get b times b, which, and I've
mentioned this in many videos,

173
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,310
cross multiplying is really
the same thing as multiplying

174
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,680
both sides by both denominators.

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,960
b times b is b squared
is equal to ce.

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,010
And now we can do something
kind of interesting.

177
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,406
We can add these two statements.

178
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:53,030
Let me rewrite the
statement down here.

179
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,100
So b squared is equal to ce.

180
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,310
So if we add the
left hand sides,

181
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,120
we get a squared plus b squared.

182
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,420
a squared plus b squared
is equal to cd plus ce.

183
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,595

184
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,917
And then we have a c
both of these terms,

185
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,000
so we could factor it out.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,880
So this is going to be equal
to-- we can factor out the c.

187
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,952
It's going to be equal
to c times d plus e.

188
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:29,790
c times d plus e and
close the parentheses.

189
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,460
Now what is d plus e?

190
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,159
d is this length,
e is this length.

191
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,169
So d plus e is actually
going to be c as well.

192
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,496
So this is going to be c.

193
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,039
So you have c times c,
which is just the same thing

194
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,030
as c squared.

195
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,700
So now we have an
interesting relationship.

196
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,150
We have that a squared plus b
squared is equal to c squared.

197
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,580
Let me rewrite that.

198
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,300
a squared.

199
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,623
Well, let me just do
an arbitrary new color.

200
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,380
I deleted that by accident,
so let me rewrite it.

201
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,390
So we've just established
that a squared plus b squared

202
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,400
is equal to c squared.

203
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,320
And this is just an
arbitrary right triangle.

204
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,590
This is true for any
two right triangles.

205
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,120
We've just established that
the sum of the squares of each

206
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,060
of the legs is equal to the
square of the hypotenuse.

207
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,550
And this is probably
what's easily

208
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,220
one of the most famous
theorem in mathematics, named

209
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,360
for Pythagoras.

210
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,370
Not clear if he's the first
person to establish this,

211
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,310
but it's called the
Pythagorean Theorem.

212
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,290

213
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,469
And it's really the basis of,
well, all not all of geometry,

214
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:43,510
but a lot of the geometry
that we're going to do.

215
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,880
And it forms the basis of a
lot of the trigonometry we're

216
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,230
going to do.

217
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,550
And it's a really
useful way, if you

218
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,299
know two of the sides
of a right triangle,

219
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,890
you can always find the third.

1
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:46,064
What?

2
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,036
Let go.

3
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:48,668
I don't want to.

4
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,004
I'm not going to let you go.

5
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:55,016
Hey, monkey.

6
00:00:55,016 --> 00:01:00,052
Okay. If you call me "monkey" I want to be a monkey for you.

7
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:13,044
Even if that's the only way. I've come to the point where I really want to cling to your shoulders.

8
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:16,036
The man that is right for you . .

9
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:19,032
is out there somewhere.

10
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:22,008
Because you . . .

11
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:25,126
aren't so bad.

12
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,598
I don't want some other guy.

13
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:32,008
If he's not Goo JoonPyo, then he won't do.

14
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,032
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:40,088
Is there someone you like?

16
00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:46,096
Yeah.

17
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:54,002
Aren't you going to ask who it is?

18
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,068
I don't want to hear.

19
00:01:55,068 --> 00:02:01,096
I can't hear a word. I don't want to hear one word. ahhhhhhh!

20
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:48,056
I don't want to hear anything!

21
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:52,012
Did you just see a ghost or something?

22
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,056
No.

23
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,018
I didn't see anything.

24
00:02:56,018 --> 00:03:00,064
I really didn't see anything!

25
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,092
Let's go.

26
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,012
Where?

27
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:04,088
If I leave you alone,

28
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:29,084
you might jump in the water again.

29
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:45,052
I feel like a fool. What is wrong with me?

30
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,044
You're not a fool.

31
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,064
So,

32
00:03:48,064 --> 00:05:21,084
don't scold yourself so much.

33
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:24,008
Why Macau of all places?

34
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,014
I'm trying to find someone.

35
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:29,076
Ah, your boyfriend?

36
00:05:29,076 --> 00:07:23,072
Uh, well, yeah.

37
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:59,034
Goo JoonPyo:"I'm leaving first."

38
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:00,076
Song WooBin!

39
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:02,072
You'd better hurry up and get down from there.

40
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,034
Hey, So YiJung.

41
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,068
Why are you still my friend?

42
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,096
What?

43
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:11,004
Give me a straight answer.

44
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:16,484
Aren't you embarrassed to be friends with the son of a mafia boss like me?

45
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:20,724
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and get down from there!

46
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:26,024
I'm embarrassed myself, so I can only imagine what it must be like for you guys.

47
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:29,051
It's only because of you guys that I get by.

48
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:34,052
Those from "decent" homes don't even consider me human.

49
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:36,009
even I know that.

50
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:43,002
Song WooBin, why are you...

51
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,082
But, I...

52
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:48,052
I'm only embarrassed in front of you guys.

53
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:52,068
My boss...the path I've got to take...

54
00:08:52,068 --> 00:09:00,152
I don't care what others say or think, but to you guys...in front of you guys...

55
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:03,269
I'm embarrassed sometimes.

56
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,056
That annoys me and I feel like I'm going to die.

57
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:12,032
Do you know? Do you guys even know?!

58
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:18,032
You jerk!

59
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,082
To you,

60
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:21,056
to you, that's all we're worth?

61
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you think we are any better than you?!

62
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,058
If you act like this, what about me? What about us?

63
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:34,000
If, once in a while you're embarrassed, can't you let it out in front of your friends?

64
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,094
Huh?

65
00:09:35,094 --> 00:10:07,566
So then, does that really make us friends? Brothers?! F4?! Tell me, you bastard!

66
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:57,006
So YiJung

67
00:10:57,006 --> 00:11:05,009
OMG! F4!

68
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:30,003
Hey, what do you think you're doing, you bastard?!

69
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:35,058
Get lost!

70
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:37,000
YiJung

71
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,005
Why'd you drink so much?

72
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:41,082
Ahh!

73
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,009
YiJung, are you okay?

74
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:46,094
Young Master, should we take care of this?

75
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:49,001
You guys stay out of it.

76
00:11:49,001 --> 00:12:03,046
I'll take care of those bastards on my own.

77
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:08,008
Do you know how much his hands are worth?

78
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:26,005
Even if Rodin could come back to life, I wouldn't trade it for that hand. Do you have any idea what you've done?!

79
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:43,082
Hang in there.

80
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:50,022
Good morning!

81
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:53,078
Unni did you sleep well, too?

82
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,058
I didn't sleep a wink.

83
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:59,058
Last night was a milestone event for Goo Joonpyo and Ha JaeKyung.

84
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:16,054
Joonpyo was so embarrassed, he took off first.

85
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,074
You two looked really good together yesterday, too.

86
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:26,042
See, wasn't it good that I suggested we come here?

87
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:29,042
Just as thread follows the needle, I'm going to take off now, too.

88
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,026
You two have fun and take your time coming back.

89
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:36,005
JiHoo, you have to make sure Jandi has a lot of fun okay?

90
00:13:36,005 --> 00:15:03,054
Uh, Unni, we, too . . .

91
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:19,062
<i>"Yoon JiHoo"</i>

92
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:25,078
<i>"Geum JanDi"</i><BR><i>"Praying for university acceptance"</i>

93
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:33,002
Y<i>"Yoon JiHoo"</i><BR><i>"Praying for constant happiness."</i>

94
00:15:33,002 --> 00:16:13,082
If you drink this, you're supposed to get in.

95
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:18,054
It's a good face.

96
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:24,018
That young lady's face is a lotus flower that can make muddy waters clear.

97
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:26,072
Cherish her.

98
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:29,012
Huh?

99
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:54,084
That girl is going to make a family for you.

100
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:58,009
How come I didn't see that girl here today?

101
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:03,004
Grandma, she's not a child working here.

102
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:05,000
Of course, she's not a child.

103
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,098
She's all grown up, a young lady.

104
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:11,022
- I love her to pieces. <BR>- Uh-huh, yes.

105
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:16,018
If I had a grandson, I would love to have her for a granddaughter-in-law.

106
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,064
No, no, that's not going to work,

107
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:24,002
because she's already been set aside for another.

108
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:29,074
Now, please be careful.

109
00:17:29,074 --> 00:18:23,005
Be careful on your way back.

110
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:30,006
I'm back.

111
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:32,319
Mom, what is all this?

112
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,024
Is there a war?

113
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:37,058
JanDi, sit down there.

114
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:40,007
We have an important announcement to make.

115
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:45,694
An announcement?

116
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:53,002
Geum JanDi, my eldest daughter, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

117
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:54,008
What is it this time?

118
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,046
Dad, did you get into trouble again?

119
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:59,009
Do you think your dad is someone who always gets into trouble!?

120
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,004
Well, you're right. So,

121
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:05,062
in order to cut off this horrible problem at its source,

122
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:09,005
I've made a crucial decision.

123
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:13,026
- A decision? <BR>- Uh-huh.

124
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,044
Early tomorrow morning,

125
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:21,006
Mom and Dad have decided to move down to where your uncle lives.

126
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,078
What?

127
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:29,004
It's been difficult to come out from under the hardship we're in now, it seems that there isn't any hope for us here.

128
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:37,001
Mom and dad are going to head down and work on the fishing boats there that way we can send you money to spend.

129
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,036
Our living expenses will be completely covered.

130
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:42,006
But then, what about KangSan and me?

131
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,008
You two have to stay here and go to school.

132
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:49,018
Geum Jandi, take good care of KangSan.

133
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:53,058
From now onwards, you are the head of the family.

134
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,086
Was there ever a time when nuna wasn't the head?

135
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:59,052
Ah, Mom!

136
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:02,024
Dad!

137
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sorry, JanDi.

138
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,032
Listen to nuna.

139
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:11,009
Make sure to wash properly and...

140
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:28,072
Oh, my poor baby.

141
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,343
Hey!

142
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,302
- Yes? <BR>- What's going on?

143
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:36,026
Um, that is...

144
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,004
Please set it here.

145
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:43,038
This . . .

146
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,094
Hey, monkey.

147
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:50,066
What are you doing at someone else's house!

148
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:52,046
Oh, my husband has woken up?

149
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,042
You must be hungry.

150
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:58,098
Let's eat breakfast.

151
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:07,058
Here, have a seat.

152
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,064
What... is all of this?

153
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:12,054
What else could they be? Obviously I prepared all of this be eaten.

154
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,034
There are chefs in my house.

155
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:19,005
I know, but I wanted to something for you and this was this only thing I could think of.

156
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:23,058
You and I are the same, there's never anything we need to buy or that we want right?

157
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:27,086
So I thought about what if it was me.

158
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:32,078
I thought, "What is it that I've always longed for?".

159
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:34,005
So what was it?

160
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:39,058
Initially, I wanted a happy, fulfilling breakfast table.

161
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:59,098
I hated eating all by myself at a huge table.

162
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:02,078
Since you've prepared everything, I'll eat it, but...

163
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:05,002
Really? Then start by eating this.

164
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:09,052
This is really good. And this is good, too.

165
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,098
This one.

166
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:21,042
Try to eat this.

167
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:24,001
All right, eat it before this gets cold . . .

168
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:29,419
You have to eat this when it's warm.

169
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:34,084
I was so happy when someone took the flesh off the bones and set the fish on my rice for me.

170
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:47,295
You've never done anything like this, have you?

171
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:51,066
Is it good?

172
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:54,058
That's a relief.

173
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,008
Eat this as well.

174
00:22:56,008 --> 00:23:00,009
And meat too.

175
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,007
Do you want to try this?

176
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:06,026
My ambitious work.

177
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:08,001
Have some of these vegetable too.

178
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,058
Dessert's after this.

179
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:23,345
Have you tried some soup? I made it really yummy.

180
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:25,096
Did you find anything?

181
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:26,068
No.

182
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:29,078
It's not really possible for there to be any.

183
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:34,086
A place with no deposit, cheap monthly rent, that's decent for a junior high and a high school student to live.

184
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:36,074
It's not likely.

185
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:41,044
Can't you just come to my house and live with me?

186
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,034
What about KangSan?

187
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:49,008
Ah yes. You have Geum KangSan.

188
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:54,509
There's no solution.

189
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:57,078
I'd better get going.

190
00:23:57,078 --> 00:24:08,007
You're the one who needs help now.

191
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:12,006
Here's the tea.

192
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:14,428
How's your shoulder?

193
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:22,053
It's better now, but now my knee is aching.

194
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:26,005
I'll get a hotpad for your knee.

195
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:33,002
Where did such a lovely sweetheart come from?

196
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:36,002
What is this?

197
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:37,012
House / Apartment

198
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:40,099
Is cutie looking for a place to stay?

199
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:43,086
Yes, I'm looking but it's not easy finding a cheap place.

200
00:24:43,086 --> 00:25:10,018
- Wait just a moment. I'll get you a hotpad for your knee. <BR>- No, no.

201
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:21,715
When did you get here?

202
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:23,002
Here.

203
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:29,066
What's this?

204
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:32,046
Though it's late, it's our engagement gift.

205
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:36,109
- Gift? <BR>- The one that our parents got is totally not my taste.

206
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:51,094
So, I had these made and I wanted to share them with you.

207
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:53,004
J J?

208
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:56,012
Uh-huh, Joonpyo and JaeKyung.

209
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,048
No, JaeKyung and Joonpyo.

210
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:04,096
Even our initials are fated, don't you think?

211
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:23,094
Put it on for me.

212
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:26,086
Where are you going?

213
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,016
There's a place I need to go to.

214
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:30,008
Where's that?

215
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,058
You're my fiancee, not my wife!

216
00:26:32,058 --> 00:29:17,018
Just go home.

217
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:18,082
Don't do that.

218
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:59,056
Straighten it out with that.

219
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:01,082
It's truly fascinating.

220
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:06,006
How can something like this be made from ordinary dirt?

221
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:13,001
You're more fascinating. What kind of girl has no other interests apart from pottery?

222
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:17,024
Then, what about you? Is there anything you like more than pottery?

223
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:21,066
- There is. <BR>- A girl?

224
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:27,096
Ummm, a girl is like a math problem.

225
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:31,014
In the beginning, I wonder how I'm going to solve it.

226
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:36,014
I figured out, if I just study it a bit more, then a solution can be found.

227
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:48,002
It's pretty simple, but there's still a wonder to it.

228
00:30:48,002 --> 00:30:52,667
Why are you looking at me like that?

229
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,136
To me, you

230
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:58,832
are like an unsolveable problem.

231
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:04,279
What?

232
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,784
A problem that starts off completely twisted and can't be solved.

233
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:29,008
Hey, get back here.

234
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:38,000
YiJung.

235
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,022
What on earth happened?

236
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:43,076
According to WooBin, your hand...

237
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:46,074
It's all over.

238
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,092
For real?

239
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:54,008
A swimmer who hurts her shoulder and has to stop swimming...

240
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:57,052
A potter,

241
00:31:57,052 --> 00:32:02,088
who ruins his hands and has to give up spinning.

242
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:07,088
Doesn't it seem like a survival documentary?

243
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:11,296
What is that supposed to mean?

244
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,359
By any chance...

245
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,008
are you talking about Geum Jandi?

246
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:22,056
Do we know any other swimmers besides Geum JanDi?

247
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,008
So YiJung,

248
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,012
Tell me straight.

249
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:29,005
What do you mean her shoulder's wrecked?

250
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:37,426
Is this what you were talking about in Macau?

251
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:44,066
If I think about it now, you really had your wits about you, back in Macau.

252
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:49,016
People like us can't have anything to do with stuff like...

253
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:52,056
innocence and love.

254
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:57,228
I said to tell it to me straight!

255
00:32:57,228 --> 00:33:01,000
Do you remember when JanDi threw herself in front of that chair so you wouldn't get hurt?

256
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,092
When she found out that she could never swim again,

257
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:12,471
do you know how much Geum Jandi cried?

258
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:18,064
Is that true?

259
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:23,028
No matter how much of a tantrum you throw, it's still the same.

260
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:28,072
People like us,

261
00:33:28,072 --> 00:34:06,076
we do nothing but hurt the women we love.

262
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:13,072
Here, right here, KangSan.

263
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:16,008
Is it okay? Just the two of you in living here?

264
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:22,002
It'll be fine. The room has a good view and it's kind of cozy, right Noona?

265
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:27,052
Thanks, GaEul. It's really late.

266
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:29,016
- I'll go then. <BR>- Thanks.

267
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,096
- See you, San. <BR>- Be careful.

268
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:38,002
Uh-huh.

269
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:41,006
KangSan, are you going to be okay?

270
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:45,016
Noona, you just don't overdo it yourself.

271
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:49,048
Let's take care not to make our Mom and Dad worried.

272
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:52,064
Fighting. <BR> Fighting.

273
00:34:52,064 --> 00:34:56,012
- Okay, Noona, over there. <BR>- Let's start cleaning.

274
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,042
You do.

275
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,007
Noona, I'll get that first.

276
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,044
I'm going to hang a framed picture on the wall

277
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:27,096
Here?

278
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:31,012
Whose fault is it that Geum JanDi can't swim anymore?!

279
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,064
Why aren't you swimming anymore?

280
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:34,002
I quit.

281
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:36,004
Why would a swimmer quit swimming?

282
00:35:36,004 --> 00:36:04,008
Its none of your business.

283
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:10,001
Watch over JoonPyo while I'm gone.

284
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,052
You know what I mean, don't you?

285
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,056
I understand.

286
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:18,008
Get a hold of me right away if anything seems remotely strange.

287
00:36:18,008 --> 00:38:41,005
Don't worry. Have a good trip.

288
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:43,076
Hey, delivery girl!

289
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:49,054
One milk for me, too.

290
00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:51,084
Hurry up and throw it-- one milk.

291
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,014
Big brother Joonpyo?

292
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:55,002
Hey! Goo Joonpyo!

293
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,048
What are you doing here?

294
00:38:57,048 --> 00:39:00,064
So, is there anything weird about me being at my own house?

295
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:01,008
Your house?

296
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:06,396
From today on, I've decided to live here.

297
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:20,006
Why? Why would you live here?

298
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:23,072
Shall we say it's some kind of preparation for independence?

299
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:26,056
Why on earth would you do something like that here?

300
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:28,009
Don't you watch any dramas?

301
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:34,058
It's pretty standard procedure to toughen up the princely heir, to train him.

302
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:39,018
Haven't you heard about deliberately throwing the son off a cliff?

303
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:44,064
- Where was that? Ssss... S...<BR>- Sparta?

304
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:46,764
Yes, that's right.

305
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:52,062
Hey little bro. Don't study all by yourself. Help your sister to study too.

306
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:56,036
It's hard to communicate when we're on such totally different livers.

307
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:57,072
Different livers?

308
00:39:57,072 --> 00:40:01,076
Different levels.

309
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:05,056
Whatever training thing you're doing, I wish you well, but could you get out already?

310
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:14,034
We are a little busy here.

311
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,068
What?

312
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:20,902
Regardless, we're neighbors now.

313
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,536
Let's try to be good neighbors.

314
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:27,012
If you have any difficulties, I'll help.

315
00:40:27,012 --> 00:41:04,016
Can I reject that request?

316
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:16,129
What I've just shown you is the wheel procedure and what you are doing is the coiling procedure...

317
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:21,048
Pay attention to the details, please.

318
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:25,004
That's it for today.

319
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:41,052
Thank you.

320
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:43,072
Confess.

321
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:45,004
Huh?

322
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:51,008
Hurry up and confess your feelings to him before it it's too late.

323
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,335
The thing is...

324
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:59,028
I'm a little scared.

325
00:41:59,028 --> 00:42:04,169
He's totally different from me.

326
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:08,096
The thing is, love cannot be achieved by patience.

327
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:14,068
You can't hide it because you want to.

328
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:22,064
Anyway, why did you break up with your lover, teacher?

329
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:28,036
I wanted to stay by his side, the way he wanted me to, but...

330
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:31,084
I wasn't able to do that.

331
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:36,092
Because I kept wanting more, and it was too hard.

332
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:40,016
Did you confess your feelings?

333
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:46,277
I wonder... did I confess?

334
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:57,092
If you don't want to regret it later, like I do. Then GaEul, you should build up your courage and confess your feelings.

335
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:03,024
What is all this?

336
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:07,054
Hey! What kind of student comes back so late?

337
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:10,153
When you're done, you should hurry up and come home..

338
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:15,008
Hey! By any chance, did you buy all this stuff?

339
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:20,007
Oh, this? I couldn't use it all by myself, so I threw it away here.

340
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:28,056
Threw away?

341
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:31,018
But...

342
00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:55,000
what's that smell?

343
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,028
Looks yummy.

344
00:43:57,028 --> 00:44:10,044
KangSan, watch out since it's hot.

345
00:44:10,044 --> 00:44:13,008
Why? What?

346
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:18,044
Yours seems more tasty.

347
00:44:18,044 --> 00:44:22,066
What? Did I cook mine separately? It's the same as yours.

348
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:26,068
Give that to me.

349
00:44:26,068 --> 00:44:34,072
Hurry up and hand it over!!

350
00:44:34,072 --> 00:45:01,076
Mmmmm, hey, don't!

351
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,044
That was really delicious!

352
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:08,074
Little bro isn't there any more?

353
00:45:08,074 --> 00:45:12,058
Because of you, we didn't get more than one mouthful!

354
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:16,052
All this time, you guys planned to keep this delicious food to yourselves?

355
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:19,008
That's awfully childish, between neighbors.

356
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,032
Are you done eating?

357
00:45:20,032 --> 00:45:25,036
Then you can leave. Go!

358
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:36,048
Little bro, don't you have more ramen?

359
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:38,016
What's up?

360
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:42,096
I don't like people who come over without a reason.

361
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:48,012
I do have . . . a reason.

362
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,088
With me,

363
00:45:50,088 --> 00:45:57,052
Will you go on a date with me?

364
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:59,064
A date?

365
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:02,536
Didn't we already do that last time?

366
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:09,002
Not a fake one. A real date.

367
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:14,082
GaEul, did something shocking happen to you?

368
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:17,006
Or, did you get dumped by some guy?

369
00:46:17,006 --> 00:46:21,056
I'm not kidding.

370
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:24,004
I . . .

371
00:46:24,004 --> 00:46:37,012
I like you, YiJung SunBae.

372
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:39,076
Thank you.

373
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:41,008
Thanks, but...

374
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:44,028
I have a few rules when it comes to dating.

375
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:46,086
Rules?

376
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:51,044
One. I don't mess with good girls.

377
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:56,713
Two. I also don't mess with idiotic girls.

378
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:06,024
Three. Never mess with girls related to my friends.

379
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:09,036
GaEul, you go against all 3 rules.

380
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,447
You know that, right?

381
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:12,088
Hence, my answer is, "No."

382
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:14,000
Sunbae.

383
00:47:14,000 --> 00:48:47,969
You know where the exit is, right?

384
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:54,054
Argh! What the heck is this? Ahhh!

385
00:48:54,054 --> 00:49:03,000
Hey! Aishhh, what is that?

386
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,032
AH~~ What's that!

387
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:06,000
Help me!!

388
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,004
Hey! Don't come!

389
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:31,052
Hey! Goo JoonPyo, what's wrong? Are you ok?

390
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:40,048
Hey! That thing...

391
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:42,004
Is this ok?

392
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:44,068
I couldn't study because you are so noisy.

393
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:49,006
Such things are a nuisance in this neighborhood.

394
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:55,008
If you do this one more time, I'm going to call the police!

395
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:55,088
Hey, Geum JanDi.

396
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:57,036
Why! What?!

397
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,022
Wait,

398
00:49:59,022 --> 00:51:44,084
Can you stay for a little while?

399
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:48,096
Unni! (*Older sister)

400
00:51:48,096 --> 00:51:50,092
JanDi!

401
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:55,008
Why didn't you tell me you moved?

402
00:51:55,008 --> 00:51:57,004
How did you find out?

403
00:51:57,004 --> 00:52:01,042
I went to your house but no one was there so I asked GaEul.

404
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:08,042
I heard about your parents. Are you okay?

405
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,007
But what is all this?

406
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:12,063
Moving presents!

407
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:16,849
Moving presents?

408
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:24,074
Chen, wait in the car. <BR> Yes, miss.

409
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:29,044
So this is the neigborhood rooftop house.

410
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:33,004
It's really romantic.

411
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:37,054
Ah, sorry. If it hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

412
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:39,098
I really didn't mean that.

413
00:52:39,098 --> 00:52:43,004
I know.

414
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:46,008
It's cold. Do you want a cup of tea before you leave?

415
00:52:46,008 --> 00:52:48,173
Is that okay?

416
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:50,898
Here. Sit here.

417
00:52:50,898 --> 00:54:41,008
Okay. Are you sure its ok?

418
00:54:41,008 --> 00:54:56,047
Is this your new way of waking people up?

419
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:59,504
I didn't know you were interested in art.

420
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,074
Ah, this?

421
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:07,471
I was supposed to go to a showing and write an art report, but it ended.

422
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:11,052
But it was so expensive, I probably wouldn't have been able to go anyway.

423
00:55:11,052 --> 00:55:14,572
So I thought I'd look at this book and write it.

424
00:55:14,572 --> 00:55:16,046
When is it due?

425
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,008
Huh?

426
00:55:17,008 --> 00:55:53,002
When is that report due?

427
00:55:53,002 --> 00:56:24,046
There is no exhibition today.

428
00:56:24,046 --> 00:57:27,056
Come in..

429
00:57:27,056 --> 00:57:30,357
Do you want that one?

430
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:32,000
Uh, no.

431
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,628
This is good enough for me.

432
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:41,059
Do you know by chance,

433
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:45,042
why the lotus blooms in the mud?

434
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:47,076
What?

435
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:56,007
Never mind.

436
00:57:56,007 --> 00:58:00,005
That girl is like the lotus flower, able to clear a muddy water.

437
00:58:00,005 --> 00:58:05,009
- Cherish her. <BR>- Pardon me?

438
00:58:05,009 --> 00:59:03,000
That girl will make a family for you.

439
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,036
Now I've become your model as well?

440
00:59:06,036 --> 00:59:10,744
Did you just wake up?

441
00:59:10,744 --> 00:59:16,072
If I'd only known, then I would have made a book.

442
00:59:16,072 --> 00:59:19,066
What kind of book?

443
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:25,022
An accounting book for all the money I should collect from Geum JanDi: transportation fee, coffee,

444
00:59:25,022 --> 00:59:29,058
for this exhibiton, and now modeling fees.

445
00:59:29,058 --> 00:59:34,034
If I add it all up, it should be a big lump sum.

446
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:48,002
Well, here's the modeling fee for a start.

447
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:51,862
Since it's drawn so well...

448
00:59:51,862 --> 01:00:01,000
I should give you something in return.

449
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:23,478
Here.

450
01:00:23,478 --> 01:00:25,088
The lotus flower,

451
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:33,016
clears and refreshes even in the muddiest of waters.

452
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:38,133
The name is pretty and its function is pretty too.

453
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:39,008
Just like you.

454
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:42,409
Huh?

455
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:43,004
That's it.

456
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:45,957
The answer to my homework.

457
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:50,046
Homework?

458
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:55,084
The more I see you, the more I'm reminded of the lotus flower.

459
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,048
Lotus flower?

460
01:00:58,048 --> 01:01:02,353
Do you know why the lotus blooms in mud?

461
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:02,898
Huh?

462
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:07,000
That's your homework until next time.

463
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,008
Thanks for the present!

464
01:01:12,008 --> 01:01:22,094
(What homework?)

465
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:24,014
What about the witch?

466
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,074
She's still in Vancouver.

467
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:28,092
- Help cover things up for me. <BR>- I understand.

468
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:30,081
Goo Joonpyo!

469
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:35,072
Please, you really can't do this.

470
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:38,052
Goo Joonpyo!

471
01:01:38,052 --> 01:01:40,036
Hey, you again?

472
01:01:40,036 --> 01:01:42,009
Obviously, the two of us connect.

473
01:01:42,009 --> 01:01:46,026
For some reason, I just felt that if I came by the house, I'd get to see you.

474
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:49,011
Did you boil your cell phone or put it somewhere?

475
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:51,092
You're supposed to call and get permission to visit before going to someone's house.

476
01:01:51,092 --> 01:01:55,054
Didn't you learn stuff like that?

477
01:01:55,054 --> 01:01:57,714
Oh, I'm tired!

478
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,068
Now that I think about it, I don't recall ever learning anything like that.

479
01:02:01,068 --> 01:02:03,072
Joonpyo, do you do that?

480
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:05,052
Hey, monkey.

481
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:07,206
Aren't you getting up?

482
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:11,002
Why are you lying down on my bed?

483
01:02:11,002 --> 01:02:13,082
Get up, hurry!

484
01:02:13,082 --> 01:02:16,028
Get up! Hurry!

485
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:23,048
Get up!

486
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:53,028
Do you want to make a bet with me?

487
01:02:53,028 --> 01:02:57,092
It's so quiet, it's making me antsy.

488
01:02:57,092 --> 01:03:00,096
I have one question for you. Will you answer?

489
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:03,002
Love or friendship . . .

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm a savant,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
or more precisely,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
a high-functioning

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
autistic savant.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a rare condition.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And rarer still when accompanied,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
as in my case,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
by self-awareness

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and a mastery of language.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Very often when I meet someone

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and they learn this about me,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
there's a certain kind of awkwardness.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I can see it in their eyes.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They want to ask me something.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And in the end, quite often,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the urge is stronger than they are

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and they blurt it out:

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
"If I give you my date of birth,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
(Laughter)

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or they mention cube roots

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or ask me to recite a long number or long text.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I hope you'll forgive me

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
if I don't perform

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a kind of one-man savant show for you today.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to talk instead

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
about something

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
far more interesting

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
than dates of birth or cube roots --

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
a little deeper

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to talk to you briefly

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
about perception.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When he was writing the plays and the short stories

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that would make his name,

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Anton Chekhov kept a notebook

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
in which he noted down

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
his observations

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
of the world around him --

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little details

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that other people seem to miss.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Every time I read Chekhov

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and his unique vision of human life,

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm reminded of why I too

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
became a writer.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In my books,

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I explore the nature of perception

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and how different kinds of perceiving

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
create different kinds of knowing

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and understanding.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here are three questions

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
drawn from my work.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Rather than try to figure them out,

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the intuitions

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and the gut instincts

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that are going through your head and your heart

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
as you look at them.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
For example, the calculation:

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
can you feel where on the number line

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the solution is likely to fall?

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds:

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
can you get a sense of the range of meanings

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that it's pointing you towards?

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And in terms of the line of poetry,

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
why does the poet use the word hare

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
rather than rabbit?

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm asking you to do this

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
because I believe our personal perceptions, you see,

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
are at the heart

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
of how we acquire knowledge.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Aesthetic judgments,

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
rather than abstract reasoning,

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
guide and shape the process

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
by which we all come to know

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
what we know.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm an extreme example of this.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
My worlds of words and numbers

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
blur with color, emotion

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and personality.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As Juan said,

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
an unusual cross-talk

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
between the senses.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here are the numbers one to 12

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
as I see them --

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
every number with its own shape and character.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
One is a flash of white light.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The sketches are in black and white here,

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but in my mind they have colors.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Three is green.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Four is blue.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Five is yellow.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I paint as well.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And here is one of my paintings.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Three-dimensional shapes

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and the space they create in the middle

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
creates a new shape,

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the answer to the sum.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What about bigger numbers?

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well you can't get much bigger than Pi,

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the mathematical constant.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's an infinite number --

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
literally goes on forever.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In this painting that I made

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
of the first 20 decimals of Pi,

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I take the colors

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and the emotions and the textures

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and I pull them all together

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Words too, for me,

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
have colors and emotions

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and textures.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And this is an opening phrase

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
from the novel "Lolita."

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And you can see here

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
how my perception of the sound L

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
helps the alliteration

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to jump right out.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Another example:

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
a little bit more mathematical.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I wonder if some of you will notice

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the construction of the sentence

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
from "The Great Gatsby."

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There is a procession of syllables --

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
wheat, one;

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
prairies, two;

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
lost Swede towns, three --

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
one, two, three.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind,

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and it helps the sentence

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to feel right.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go back to the questions

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I posed you a moment ago.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
64 multiplied by 75.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If some of you play chess,

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you'll know that 64

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is a square number,

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and that's why chessboards,

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
eight by eight,

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
have 64 squares.

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So that gives us a form

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that we can picture, that we can perceive.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What about 75?

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well if 100,

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
if we think of 100 as being like a square,

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
75 would look like this.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So what we need to do now

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is put those two pictures

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
together in our mind --

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
something like this.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
64 becomes 6,400.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And in the right-hand corner,

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you don't have to calculate anything.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Four across, four up and down --

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
it's 16.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So what the sum is actually asking you to do

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is 16,

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
16, 16.

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's a lot easier

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's 16, 16, 16, 48,

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
4,800 --

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
4,800,

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the answer to the sum.

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Easy when you know how.

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
(Laughter)

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The second question was an Icelandic word.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm assuming there are not many people here

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
who speak Icelandic.

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So let me narrow the choices down to two.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hnugginn:

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is it a happy word,

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
or a sad word?

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What do you say?

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Some people say it's happy.

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Most people, a majority of people,

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
say sad.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And it actually means sad.

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
(Laughter)

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why do, statistically,

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
a majority of people

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
say that a word is sad, in this case,

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
heavy in other cases?

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In my theory, language evolves in such a way

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that sounds match,

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
correspond with, the subjective,

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
with the personal,

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
intuitive experience

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
of the listener.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's have a look at the third question.

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's a line from a poem by John Keats.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Words, like numbers,

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
express fundamental relationships

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
between objects

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and events and forces

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that constitute our world.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It stands to reason that we, existing in this world,

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
should in the course of our lives

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
absorb intuitively those relationships.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And poets, like other artists,

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
play with those intuitive understandings.

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In the case of hare,

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
it's an ambiguous sound in English.

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And if we think of that --

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
let me put the picture up --

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the fibers represent vulnerability.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They yield to the slightest movement

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
or motion or emotion.

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So what you have is an atmosphere

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
of vulnerability and tension.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The hare itself, the animal --

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
not a cat, not a dog, a hare --

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
why a hare?

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because think of the picture --

222
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
not the word, the picture.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The overlong ears,

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the overlarge feet,

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
helps us to picture, to feel intuitively,

226
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
what it means to limp

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and to tremble.

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So in these few minutes,

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I hope I've been able to share

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
a little bit of my vision of things

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and to show you

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that words can have colors and emotions,

233
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
numbers, shapes and personalities.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The world is richer,

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
vaster

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
than it too often seems to be.

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I hope that I've given you the desire

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to learn to see the world with new eyes.

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you.

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
(Applause)

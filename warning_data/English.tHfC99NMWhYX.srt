1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,300
We're asked to sort the
following units of measurement

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,860
into two categories:
U.S. customary

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,260
units and metric units.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,430
So these are just two different
systems. You'll get

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,840
more and more familiar
with them.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,110
Then indicate whether each unit
measures length, weight,

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,390
mass, or volume.

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,970
Let's do the first. Let's see
which of these are U.S.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,590
customary unit versus
metric units.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,900
So the liter is a metric unit.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,020
You would use it in
the metric system.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,390
A gallon is a U.S.
customary unit.

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,700
We've been dealing with that.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,090
If you fill your gasoline in
Europe, you're going to be

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,410
filling it in terms of liters.

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,730
In the U.S., you're going
to be filling

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,570
it in terms of gallons.

19
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,190
And we're going to talk about
whether they're units of

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,970
volume and whatnot
in a little bit.

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,985
Decigram, that is
metric system.

22
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:53,530

23
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,750
In general, whenever you see
these prefixes, deci, centi,

24
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,000
kilo, you're dealing with
the metric system.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,840
No one ever talks about
a kilopound.

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,010
I guess you could, but no one
really talks about it.

27
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,379
Same thing, millimeter.

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,519
This is metric system.

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,190
A gram is metric system.

30
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,700
Meter is metric system.

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,700
The foot is a U.S.
customary unit.

32
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,750
We'll talk about whether it's
distance or any of that in a

33
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,450
little bit.

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,900
Kilogram, once again,
it is metric units.

35
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,630

36
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,750
In case you haven't gotten what
I'm doing here, blue for

37
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,540
metric, red for U.S. customary
units, or I guess magenta.

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,720
Centiliter, that is metric.

39
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,180
Centimeter, meters are metric.

40
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,880
And notice we have the
prefix in both cases.

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,110
Centi means 1/100.

42
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,840
Cup, that is U.S.
customary units.

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,800
I have to do that
in the magenta.

44
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,140
Cup, U.S. customary units.

45
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,830
Meter, that is the
metric system.

46
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,360

47
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,530
Pound, U.S. customary units.

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,220
It's getting a little tedious.

49
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,250
Inch, same thing, that's what
we use in the U.S. Ounce, we

50
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,600
use that in the U.S. And then
the yard, we also use that in

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,110
the U.S.

52
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,190
Now we've divided them up.

53
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,120
All the magenta ones are used
in the U.S. All of the blue

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,230
ones are used really in the
rest of the world, and

55
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,790
actually some places in
the U.S. as well.

56
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,260
I think a lot of the world is
frustrated that the U.S., that

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,450
we're not all converted to this
because the metric system

58
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,760
is actually a little
bit more logical.

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,870
It's easy to just figure out
what it's saying, and we'll

60
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,970
deal with that in more
detail in the future.

61
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,090
Now the next thing we to
figure out is whether

62
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,290
something is a measure of
length, weight/mass-- and

63
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,640
they're not exactly
the same thing.

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,580
Mass is how much of a substance
you have. Weight is

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,060
how much force with
which gravity is

66
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,590
pulling on that mass.

67
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,690
And it would change depending
on what planet you're on.

68
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,870
But on Earth, they tend to be
used interchangeably, so we'll

69
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,930
use it roughly interchangeably
here.

70
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,680
And then you have volume,
or how much space

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,820
something takes up.

72
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,380
So this is distance.

73
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,000
This is moving in
one dimension.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,790
Mass is how much
stuff there is.

75
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,540
Weight is how much the force
that stuff is pulled on, on a

76
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,470
planet, by gravity, or I
guess a star anywhere.

77
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,030
And volume is how much space
does that stuff take up.

78
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,000
Now let's think about it.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,580
Liter is volume.

80
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,380
This right here is volume.

81
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,390
How much space do you take up.

82
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,860
Gallon is also volume.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,390
That's in the U.S. And in
Europe, or in the metric

84
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,830
system, it would be a liter.

85
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,420
That's a gram.

86
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,745
Gram is a unit of mass.

87
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:32,760

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,110
So decigram just means
1/10 of a gram.

89
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,810
Millimeter.

90
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,610
Meter is a unit.

91
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,890
Meter right here, that is the
unit of distance or of length.

92
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,500
Millimeter, milli means
1/1,000 of a meter.

93
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,570
Foot, that is also
a unit of length.

94
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,250
Kilogram, that just
means 1,000 grams.

95
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,320
Kilo means a thousand.

96
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,800
Gram, we already said,
is a unit of mass.

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,900
Centiliter, that means
1/100 of a liter.

98
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,640
Liter, we already figured out,
is a unit of volume.

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,330
Centimeter, we already
figured out.

100
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,700
Meter is a unit of length.

101
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,650
Centimeter means 1/100
of a meter.

102
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,630
So this is a unit of length.

103
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,370
Cup, we've seen multiple
times already.

104
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,110
It is a unit of volume,
how much space does

105
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,240
something take up.

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,390
Meter, that is length.

107
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,210
We've seen it multiple
times already.

108
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,820
Pound, that is actually
a unit of weight.

109
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,720

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,490
An inch is a unit of length.

111
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,950
We're all familiar with it.

112
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,020
An ounce-- you have to be
careful here-- if someone just

113
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,830
has an ounce, that is
1/16 of a pound.

114
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,330
It as a unit of weight.

115
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,460
If it was written fluid ounce,
then we'd be talking about

116
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,790
1/16 of a pint, and then it
would be a unit of volume.

117
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,300
But since it's just ounce,
it's a unit of

118
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,380
weight, 1/16 of a pound.

119
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,690
And then finally, a yard
is a unit of length.

120
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,460
And we are done.

121
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,467

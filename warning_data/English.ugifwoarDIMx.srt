1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,590
Use the commutative law of
addition-- let me underline

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,970
that-- the commutative law
of addition to write the

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,510
expression 5 plus 8 plus 5
in a different way and

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,470
then find the sum.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,550
Now, this commutative law of
addition sounds like a very

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,790
fancy thing, but all it means
is if you're just adding a

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,680
bunch of numbers, it doesn't
matter what order you add the

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,500
numbers in.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,090
So we could add it as
5 plus 8 plus 5.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,990
We could order it as
5 plus 5 plus 8.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,140
We could order it
8 plus 5 plus 5.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,750
These are all going to add up
to the same things, and it

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,235
makes sense.

14
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:43,750
If I have 5 of something and
then I add 8 more and then I

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,250
add 5 more, I'm going to get
the same thing as if I had

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,280
took 5 of something, then added
the 5, then added the 8.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,270
You could try all
of these out.

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,770
You'll get the same thing.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,420
Now, they say in a different
way, and then find the sum.

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,480
The easiest one to find the sum
of-- actually, let's do

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,950
all of them.

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,110
But the easiest one, just
because a lot of people

23
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,660
immediately know that 5 plus 5
is 10, is to maybe start with

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,150
the 5 plus 5.

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,980
So if you have 5 plus
5, that's 10, plus

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,690
8 is equal to 18.

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,370
Now, let's verify that these two
are the same exact thing.

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,040
Up here, 5 plus 8 is 13.

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,840
13 plus 5 is also 18.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,520
That is also 18.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,550
If we go down here,
8 plus 5 is 13.

32
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,720
13 plus 5 is also equal to 18.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,900
So no matter how you do it and
no matter what order you do it

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,420
in-- and that's the commutative
law of addition.

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,790
It sounds very fancy, but it
just means that order doesn't

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,370
matter if you're adding
a bunch of things.

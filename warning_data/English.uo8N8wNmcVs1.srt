1
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:09,323
Tell me not to do it.

2
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:31,806
Tell me not to go!!

3
00:00:31,806 --> 00:02:17,297
Miss JaeKyung is looking for Miss Geum JanDi.

4
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:38,012
It seems the groom is running way too late...

5
00:02:38,012 --> 00:03:38,067
The groom is entering.

6
00:03:38,067 --> 00:04:28,567
The bride is entering.

7
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,939
Starting now,

8
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:41,258
the ceremony for the union of Goo JunPyo and Ha JaeKyung will begin.

9
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:59,151
To this couple comes marriage and the union of the bride and groom.

10
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:06,444
If anyone objects, please speak now,

11
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:14,564
or forever hold your peace.

12
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:22,949
The Lord . . .

13
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,953
What are you doing right now?

14
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:28,463
I...

15
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:32,004
I object to this wedding.

16
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,711
Miss JaeKyung!

17
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:39,054
JaeKyung, what are you doing?!

18
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:46,224
I, bride Ha JaeKyung, object to this wedding.

19
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,751
Wh-What?

20
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:54,975
Aren't there any others who object?

21
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:57,805
I also object.

22
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,434
I also object.

23
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:01,936
Me too.

24
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:03,387
Me too.

25
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:08,028
I also object.

26
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:09,682
Miss JaeKyung.

27
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:12,503
This joke seems a little overboard.

28
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:14,175
Having fun is fine, but...

29
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,643
Madam Chairman,

30
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,712
also Mom and Dad;

31
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,254
This isn't a joke.

32
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:31,573
I can't go along with this marriage to Goo JunPyo.

33
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:41,502
No matter how much I think about it, marriage just doesn't suit me right now.

34
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,189
I'm sorry.

35
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:48,901
Because of my conduct, I've caused a lot of trouble.

36
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,311
Dad.

37
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:59,052
Because this is all my fault, please don't take it out on Shinhwa Group.

38
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,183
Madam Chairman.

39
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:03,456
and

40
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,524
Goo JunPyo,

41
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:12,141
I'm sincerely sorry.

42
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:18,639
Please forgive me.

43
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:32,052
Unbelievable.

44
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:37,558
What happened?

45
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:41,829
I'm usually a pretty cool girl.

46
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:48,269
Unni!

47
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:53,474
Oh yeah, Chen...

48
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:57,812
Chen, how's it going?

49
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:32,545
We're bringing her there right now.

50
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,244
Goo JunPyo!

51
00:08:34,244 --> 00:09:31,772
JanDi.

52
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,408
Until when are you going to keep crying?

53
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,932
If someone saw,

54
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,179
I would look like the bad guy.

55
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:44,285
Where can you find something more than a beautiful happy ending?

56
00:09:44,285 --> 00:10:15,683
JaeKyung unni is so cool.

57
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:19,086
That day...

58
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:25,459
You asked why I didn't go, didn't you?

59
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,995
I...

60
00:10:27,995 --> 00:11:15,001
don't believe in happy endings.

61
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:31,873
Are you ok ?

62
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:34,922
This is why I always tell you to be careful all the time!

63
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:38,018
Sorry. I'm okay..

64
00:11:38,018 --> 00:12:03,035
You have guests, so I'll get going.

65
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:12,056
Weren't you waiting because you had something to tell me?

66
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:53,668
I have a favor to ask.

67
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:57,423
JanDi...

68
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:01,995
I can't let her go.

69
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:05,443
Even though I always make things hard for her.

70
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:10,102
I've sometimes thought it might be better to let her go to you.

71
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:15,788
I didn't even want to think about it, but if I had to

72
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:20,242
I thought you should be the one.

73
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:24,329
It can't be anyone else but you, JiHoo.

74
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,007
Goo JunPyo.

75
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:35,288
Even so, I don't think I can.

76
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:38,436
This lawn (JanDi) is the same as usual.

77
00:13:38,436 --> 00:14:35,856
I missed it.

78
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:38,906
Don't you regret it?

79
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:41,382
I do.

80
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:48,055
I've been regretting the moment I let Goo JunPyo go.

81
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,886
JiHoo, I was supporting you, but . . .

82
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:54,922
It's now a waste since I gave up.

83
00:14:54,922 --> 00:15:00,161
So I can't even do that.

84
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:03,036
Not long ago,

85
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:07,033
I asked JunPyo:

86
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:10,322
"Between friendship and love,

87
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:13,208
If you were to pick only one,

88
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:20,048
What would you choose?".

89
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:26,754
He said he wouldn't give up either

90
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:32,382
They say people get as much as they are greedy for.

91
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:40,935
Neither you nor I have enough greed.

92
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:49,048
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow.

93
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:59,072
Can you give this to JanDi for me?

94
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:03,018
That J J

95
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:09,038
You have no idea how much I hoped it meant JiHoo and JanDi.

96
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:19,574
JiHoo, you probably don't know.

97
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:25,098
Good luck!

98
00:16:25,098 --> 00:17:23,804
Take care.

99
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:30,344
Miss prepared this so that you can be comfortable.

100
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:34,448
Excuse me.

101
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:40,021
Please give this message to JaeKyung unni.

102
00:17:40,021 --> 00:19:58,492
If it's okay with her, nothing has changed with our sister relationship.

103
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:44,471
Eat.

104
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:49,343
Miss Geum JanDi.

105
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:52,058
Would you like to dance with me?

106
00:20:52,058 --> 00:21:22,509
I can't dance.

107
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:24,979
There's something I've been wanting to ask you from the beginning.

108
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,058
What is it?

109
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:29,075
Why was it me?

110
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:36,225
Me, I'm not pretty, I don' t have money or anything.

111
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:39,438
Why do you even like me?

112
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,584
Because I have everything.

113
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:43,069
What?

114
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:49,136
Because I have money, status, and looks. I have all that.

115
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:51,716
I don't need anything.

116
00:21:51,716 --> 00:22:03,262
Geum JanDi, all you need to be is Geum JanDi.

117
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:07,388
It's really pretty.

118
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,074
Do you see the brightest star right there?

119
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,313
Yeah.

120
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:16,763
It's a star called Sirius in the Orion Constellation.

121
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:20,464
The brightest star in the winter sky.

122
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,395
You could say its existence looks like Goo JunPyo.

123
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,467
How?

124
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,705
Then I'm that one.

125
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:30,246
That one, that one, that one!

126
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:32,449
I want to be that one.

127
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:35,916
You sure do have taste.

128
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:39,884
Thats the second brightest star, Procyon.

129
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:42,089
That's it, benevolence at someone else's expense.

130
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:45,162
You're always so outgoing and obnoxious

131
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,894
It suits you perfectly.

132
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:53,861
What?

133
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:54,932
But...

134
00:22:54,932 --> 00:23:05,512
How did you get to like stars?

135
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,993
When I was little,

136
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:13,287
my Dad sent me a telescope for my birthday.

137
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:22,949
He wrote in the card: study the stars well and we'll go look at them together.

138
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:26,148
So you went around looking at stars with your dad.

139
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:28,604
No.

140
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:31,438
I never went, not even once.

141
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:33,007
Why not?

142
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:40,742
Believing in that promise, I studied enough to go to major in astronomy, but

143
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:46,285
do you know what I got for Christmas a few years later?

144
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:52,558
A telescope.

145
00:23:52,558 --> 00:24:10,217
It was then that I realized it wasn't my Father sending those gifts, but his secretary.

146
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:13,514
Do you know what my dream is?

147
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:17,418
In the future, going to see the stars with your son.

148
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:20,287
How lame!

149
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:29,782
Not making promises I can't keep.

150
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:33,675
JanDi.

151
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:38,439
I'm sorry for hurting you.

152
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:40,441
JanDi.

153
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:46,088
What now?

154
00:24:46,088 --> 00:25:34,161
I love you.

155
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:39,199
Look at this bliss.

156
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,467
When did you arrive?

157
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,168
JanDi!

158
00:25:42,168 --> 00:26:18,438
GaEul!

159
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:20,674
It's a relief.

160
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,322
What is?

161
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:31,018
That you're smiling.

162
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:39,826
Here.

163
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,561
This...

164
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:44,731
I don't know why she had it, but

165
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:46,633
she told me to give it to you.

166
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:53,273
Where is she right now?

167
00:26:53,273 --> 00:28:05,412
She's about to depart.

168
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:20,394
Miss, it's time to go in.

169
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:24,598
Unni! JaeKyung unni! Hey, monkey!

170
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:26,533
JanDi! Goo JoonPyo!

171
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:29,403
How did you get here?

172
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,538
How can you just leave like this?

173
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:37,011
You weren't going to say goodbye to your little sis?

174
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:41,348
What kind of unni does that?

175
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:42,449
Sorry!

176
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:48,084
I'm really weak when it comes to saying goodbye.

177
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,039
Even the fierce Ha JaeKyung had a weak point?

178
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,062
That's right.

179
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:57,464
Have a safe journey.

180
00:28:57,464 --> 00:28:59,299
And...

181
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:06,315
Thanks.

182
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:09,009
If you guys break up, I'll die from the injustice of it.

183
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:13,733
So, if you want to break up, come report to me and get permission.

184
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:18,684
Got it?

185
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:22,171
Unni...

186
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:37,923
Let me hug you once, my little sis, Jandi.

187
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:58,638
I'm leaving.

188
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:35,295
Have an enjoyable flight.

189
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,221
This is mine.

190
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:38,658
I picked it though.

191
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:40,356
I had dibs on it first.

192
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:44,535
Hurry, let go!

193
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,606
What are you? Hey!

194
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:48,898
Hurry up and apologize, you jerk!

195
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,491
Get down!

196
00:30:50,491 --> 00:31:29,883
Apologize! Hurry!

197
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:33,787
I know this also, originally belonged to JanDi.

198
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:35,944
But, just this one thing,

199
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:39,751
this one thing, give it to me, please.

200
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:53,607
Don't you think I should have at least one special memory to treasure?

201
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:57,521
Shinhwa Group and JK's merger has become uncertain, and

202
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:01,681
the stock market and the government are watching Shinhwa's movements.

203
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:33,521
Shinhwa Group had planned to become in-laws with the American-based JK. Now due to the broken engagement, Shinhwa is...

204
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:37,022
Hey. Open the door.

205
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:40,052
Hey!

206
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:44,388
Open the door!

207
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:48,015
Hey! I said open the door!

208
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:50,875
Hey. Can't you hear me?

209
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:54,341
I said open the door!

210
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,566
This time, shouldn't you just come to my house?

211
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:59,639
What's the point of getting another house?

212
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:06,779
Who's to know whether that Evil Witch might tear down your house or kick you out in the middle of the night?

213
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,949
I should probably pack my belongings right away.

214
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:11,817
I'm really in trouble.

215
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:24,251
There's no need for that.

216
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:27,281
I knew you were something else, but

217
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:31,479
I didn't see you as someone who could pretend to be innocent, yet run around doing these kind of sly things behind people's backs.

218
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:34,151
It really is unbelievable.

219
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:38,357
It was my fault that I couldn't completely take care of things, but

220
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:40,525
I didn't know I would regret it so much.

221
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:42,815
Excuse me! Why are you treating JanDi like this?

222
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:52,463
JanDi did nothing, but actually helped the two of them so they could work out.

223
00:33:52,463 --> 00:34:01,449
If you have eyes, look at it.

224
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:05,838
Because of a worthless thing like you, do you know how huge a problem has been created?

225
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:09,913
A child like you couldn't even imagine the amount of damage that you've caused.

226
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:13,846
Look at what you have done to our household!

227
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:17,811
I'm not going to just sit back and suffer anymore.

228
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:22,661
It'd be best if you don't think I'll let things go like I have been.

229
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:29,228
I will make sure that you realize and understand and come to regret how monstrous a problem you've created.

230
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:32,077
isn't this what you wanted?

231
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:38,021
Hey there! It seems you're going a bit too far in the way you're talking to the child.

232
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,406
Grandpa!

233
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:43,142
Sir, how did you come to be here?

234
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:46,868
It's been a while, Shi Su.

235
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:52,552
Or do I need to call you Chairwoman Kang now?

236
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:56,489
You've changed a lot.

237
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:59,241
Let's talk about us later.

238
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:02,694
Let's talk about her first.

239
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:04,964
How do you know that child?

240
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:08,501
She's going to be my granddaughter-in-law.

241
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,067
What do you mean?

242
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:16,018
She's the girl I picked just for JiHoo.

243
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:17,743
Grandfather!

244
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,778
Are you serious?

245
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:27,487
Until now, I just kept an eye on her, but now, she's no different than family.

246
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:36,363
I would appreciate it if you didn't treat her so carelessly in the future.

247
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,364
JanDi, what are you doing?

248
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:41,314
Get your bags and follow me!

249
00:35:41,314 --> 00:36:06,625
Y-Y-Yes.

250
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:07,693
Sunbae.

251
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:12,314
Starting today, she's going to be living with us.

252
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:13,466
What?

253
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:15,051
JiHoo, what are you doing?

254
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:38,191
You should be showing her to her room.

255
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:41,006
I came because Grandfather dragged me here, but

256
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:51,017
I can go to GaEul's tomorrow.

257
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,638
You kids!

258
00:36:52,638 --> 00:37:00,231
Who said you two, all grown up boy and girl, could be in the same room together with the door closed?

259
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:03,916
Grandfather, I'm sorry and I'm grateful.

260
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,152
I'll spend the night here today.

261
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:08,054
Don't think about running away,

262
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:10,423
and there's nothing to be grateful for.

263
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:14,207
You're the person that forced me into this house with that kid.

264
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:17,043
I brought you here to punish you.

265
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:18,631
What?

266
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:25,471
Do you know how hard it is for me to walk on eggshells around that grandson of mine?

267
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:28,475
Grandfather and Sunbae are . . . and I'm-

268
00:37:28,475 --> 00:38:19,091
If you have caused trouble, then you should take the blame for it and accept your punishment.

269
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:22,962
JanDi might feel uncomfortable here.

270
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:29,435
It's not you who's uncomfortable?

271
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:34,741
I don't know anything about young people and their feelings being such and such.

272
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:38,211
I suppose things will happen as fate wills it to.

273
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:40,078
But that child

274
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:43,483
has no place under heaven to go.

275
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:49,155
I want to become a guardian for that child.

276
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:52,325
There's nothing to like or be uncomfortable about.

277
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:59,832
But for like a child like Jandi to be paired with someone as stoic as you...

278
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:25,324
I'm against it, my boy.

279
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:26,926
When I think about it,

280
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:29,829
That was the first time EunJae asked for a favor.

281
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:36,702
That day, do you know what I was doing?

282
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:39,839
I have a favor to ask.

283
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,847
Favor?

284
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:51,951
Tomorrow morning, by 7 come here to this place.

285
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:56,022
Don't ask me for a reason.

286
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:59,191
Cha EunJae.

287
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:01,399
What is this?

288
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:07,567
I'm leaving.

289
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:10,336
YiJung!

290
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:50,799
I really hope that you'll come out.

291
00:40:50,799 --> 00:41:00,082
<i>Mother

292
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:04,991
What is it now?

293
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:07,827
A farewell trip?

294
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:09,629
And if I get him for you?

295
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:14,834
What's the use?

296
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,017
Mom.

297
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:22,274
Can't you just let him go now?

298
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:23,576
Please.

299
00:41:23,576 --> 00:42:18,564
I said to give up now!

300
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:33,045
Please get in.

301
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:40,119
To be honest, I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Jandi.

302
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:55,134
A favor?

303
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:58,871
Whenever you have spare time, as a part-time job,

304
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,541
Can you come visit this person?

305
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,778
Me?

306
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:07,098
You can tell him stories

307
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:12,497
or you can just show your face once in a while.

308
00:43:12,497 --> 00:43:15,501
Who is this person?

309
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:18,361
To me, he's like an older brother.

310
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:24,748
He's the same as family.

311
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:27,767
But why did you ask me to do this?

312
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:34,414
Because what this person needs the most...is warmth.

313
00:43:34,414 --> 00:43:36,634
If I tell you that among the people I've met, Jandi, you

314
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:41,414
seem to be the warmest person,

315
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:46,118
would that be an answer?

316
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:49,121
Of course, you will be adequately compensated.

317
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,289
Oh, no!

318
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:55,294
If it is something I can help with, then of course, I'll do it.

319
00:43:55,294 --> 00:44:02,965
This is a personal favor; neither the young master nor the Chairwoman must find out.

320
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:12,396
Okay. Okay.

321
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,876
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

322
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:22,453
My name is Geum JanDi. Though I'm lacking in much, I'll be a good friend to you.

323
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:25,431
Starting today, let's get along with each other.

324
00:44:25,431 --> 00:45:21,163
Fighting!

325
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:23,553
Young Master.

326
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:25,417
What happened to JanDi?

327
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,557
Is she okay?

328
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,655
Dr. Yoon took her to his house.

329
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:30,841
To JiHoo's house?

330
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:44,036
Right now, that is the safest place she can be.

331
00:45:44,036 --> 00:46:08,536
Lend me your cell phone.

332
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:26,195
I feel assured since she's at your house.

333
00:46:26,195 --> 00:46:30,244
JoonPyo.

334
00:46:30,244 --> 00:46:35,421
But why am I feeling so anxious?

335
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:53,026
My heart keeps feeling anguished.

336
00:46:53,026 --> 00:47:19,631
<i> Goo JunPyo

337
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,401
Jan Di.

338
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:35,863
WooBin Sunbae.

339
00:47:35,863 --> 00:47:38,676
These days feel like death warmed over.

340
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:41,587
YiJung is acting like an invalid.

341
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:44,009
JoonPyo's under house arrest.

342
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:47,038
It's so stressful. Look!

343
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:51,033
Even my skin is a mess.

344
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,798
Don't worry too much.

345
00:47:52,798 --> 00:47:54,233
It's nothing big.

346
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:56,301
He's just not allowed to go out.

347
00:47:56,301 --> 00:48:00,339
He destroyed a wedding in front of that important figure.

348
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:03,776
It'd be even weirder if nothing happened.

349
00:48:03,776 --> 00:48:07,004
In any case, I was planning on going to see JoonPyo.

350
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:12,888
Do you have any message you want me to pass on to him?

351
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:16,004
JanDi, are you okay?

352
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:21,787
Ah! As for me, well, I'm doing really well.

353
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:23,145
What?

354
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:25,297
Why are you looking at me like that?

355
00:48:25,297 --> 00:48:27,132
Just because.

356
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:33,124
Living at JiHoo's house, both you and JiHoo look comfortable.

357
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:38,192
Geum JanDi, Goo JoonPyo, Yoon JiHoo. You three.

358
00:48:38,192 --> 00:48:41,078
Whatever kind of fate it is...

359
00:48:41,078 --> 00:48:43,682
it sure is complicated.

360
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:49,455
I'm just saying that's how it is.

361
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:52,039
Be strong, Geum JanDi.

362
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,026
And thanks.

363
00:48:55,026 --> 00:48:56,728
For what?

364
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,013
JiHoo.

365
00:48:58,013 --> 00:49:02,367
I don't think I've ever seen him so comfortable-looking.

366
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:03,936
And about finding his grandfather.

367
00:49:03,936 --> 00:49:05,204
It's all thanks to you.

368
00:49:05,204 --> 00:49:07,038
It's not.

369
00:49:07,038 --> 00:49:17,149
No, lately I'm the one that is being a burden.

370
00:49:17,149 --> 00:49:24,141
Here. I'll clean your hands.

371
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:38,203
It feels refreshing, doesn't it?

372
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:42,407
The worst kind of encounter is the fish meeting,

373
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:45,644
because meeting leaves a horrible fishy smell.

374
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:51,095
The encounter one must be most careful with is the flower meeting.

375
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:57,956
Because when it blooms, it has a wonderful fragrance, but when it wilts, it is thrown away.

376
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:04,095
The most beautiful encounter is the handkerchief meeting.

377
00:50:04,095 --> 00:50:44,536
Because when you exert yourself, the sweat is wiped away, and when you're sad, the tears are wiped away.

378
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:49,875
I really like this phrase,

379
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:56,247
a handkerchief-like meeting.

380
00:50:56,247 --> 00:51:00,686
Sir, how was it with you?

381
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:05,423
It would be great if I could be like a handkerchief to you.

382
00:51:05,423 --> 00:51:07,426
Don't you think?

383
00:51:07,426 --> 00:51:14,132
Isn't that right, sir?

384
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:58,944
Then, I'll read you something different next.

385
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:03,649
Do you want me to do it?

386
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:05,584
It's all right.

387
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:07,185
If I leave you to yourself,

388
00:52:07,185 --> 00:52:34,379
I don't think you'll be able to go to school tomorrow.

389
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:36,882
You can't right there!

390
00:52:36,882 --> 00:53:16,855
You can't cut the hair in the back!

391
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:19,191
I'll help you.

392
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:22,827
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

393
00:53:22,827 --> 00:54:01,955
You have to let me pay you back for trimming my hair.

394
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:41,703
It's a car wash!

395
00:54:41,703 --> 00:54:46,154
I wanted to tell you.

396
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:54,565
That...

397
00:54:54,565 --> 00:55:02,689
I love you.

398
00:55:02,689 --> 00:55:04,805
I wanted to say it out loud like that.

399
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:49,004
That is all.

400
00:55:49,004 --> 00:55:51,042
Are you quitting?

401
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:53,968
Are you really going to run away like this?

402
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:56,005
Do you think that this is what that person wants?

403
00:55:56,005 --> 00:55:57,599
It doesn't matter anymore.

404
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,107
It matters to me.

405
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:03,215
In order to make your heart strong so that it isn't easily broken

406
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:09,085
you said I needed to be molded, and shaped and burned in fiery oven; to endure that.

407
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:12,645
So that you don't have any regrets. You said that.

408
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:17,922
It was all nonsense.

409
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:19,463
It's not over yet.

410
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,475
You haven't done everything yet.

411
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:24,374
I can't give up like this.

412
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:42,059
I'm going to make this hand move again.

413
00:56:42,059 --> 00:57:43,316
I just need to get in. Go over there.

414
00:57:43,316 --> 00:57:47,078
Thank you.

415
00:57:47,078 --> 00:57:52,433
Take care.

416
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:54,575
Hey, GaEul.

417
00:57:54,575 --> 00:57:58,633
What's wrong? Are you okay?

418
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:02,804
Hey! What are you doing these days?

419
00:58:02,804 --> 00:58:07,088
You haven't been sleeping and you've been coming out before the crack of dawn.

420
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:10,718
Tell me. What's wrong?

421
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:14,533
Is it something I can help you with?

422
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:17,232
Don't worry.

423
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:25,487
I only have a little more to do before it's over.

424
00:58:25,487 --> 00:58:27,202
Are you ready?

425
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:28,663
Yeah. Okay.

426
00:58:28,663 --> 00:58:33,524
Let's move out.

427
00:58:33,524 --> 00:58:42,243
One. Two. Three.

428
00:58:42,243 --> 00:58:43,978
I'm going out with my friend.

429
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,048
Whether you decide to follow or not, do whatever you want.

430
00:58:46,048 --> 00:59:01,057
Then we shall go as well.

431
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:19,342
Manager Lee, you're ready, right?

432
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:28,122
Catch them! <BR> Hey! You almost caused an accident.

433
00:59:28,122 --> 00:59:29,413
Don't worry and do whatever you need.

434
00:59:29,413 --> 00:59:31,125
I'll take good care of him.

435
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,628
Mom will be right back. Have fun with Noona.

436
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:34,755
Please take care of him.

437
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:37,331
Say "Bye, Mom." Bye, Mom.

438
00:59:37,331 --> 00:59:39,634
Take care.

439
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:46,274
Let's have fun.

440
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:47,675
Gu JunPyo!

441
00:59:47,675 --> 00:59:51,579
Are you okay?

442
00:59:51,579 --> 01:00:19,774
Right now?

443
01:00:19,774 --> 01:00:26,814
I'm tired.

444
01:00:26,814 --> 01:00:28,828
What is it?

445
01:00:28,828 --> 01:00:30,651
This isn't an 'it', it's a kid.

446
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:34,262
We haven't seen each other in forever, why on earth would you bring a little leech with you?

447
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:37,425
Did you adopt him from somewhere?

448
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,994
Noona, let's go here.

449
01:00:39,994 --> 01:00:42,751
Okay, let's go.

450
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:46,052
I was wondering why you asked to meet at a zoo.

451
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:47,902
Is that little leech more important than I am?

452
01:00:47,902 --> 01:00:52,044
If you don't want to be a leech yourself, then stop whining and follow me.

453
01:00:52,044 --> 01:00:57,611
Let's go.

454
01:00:57,611 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's go together.

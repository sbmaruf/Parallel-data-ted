1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,261
It's here.

2
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:11,675
Master.

3
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:13,167
Hyung-nim.

4
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:16,695
We should go inside.

5
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:19,075
Relocate my arm here?!

6
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:22,085
Forget it. I want to leave!

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:23,363
Wow, it's done!

8
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:26,317
Master, I can move my arm well now!

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:33,233
Oh? He can move his arm well now...

10
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:39,775
I think he relocated his arm.

11
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,443
Who is this?<i>Episode 2 -- Part 1

12
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:46,084
Parking their car in front of someone else's alley like this!

13
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:49,449
What is this?

14
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,833
Ah, this neighborhood, seriously...

15
00:00:50,833 --> 00:01:01,224
They should just demolish this whole neighborhood and redevelop it!

16
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:06,676
I might die squashed like this going around collecting rent.

17
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:08,805
Ah, my stomach!

18
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:10,308
Argh!

19
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:16,006
We meet again.

20
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,993
Who are you?

21
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:21,035
Oh my!It seem like you don't remember me.

22
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,112
Ah, this is so upsetting.

23
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:27,117
Last time, you stole the scooter from her and she beat me to death...

24
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:30,452
That's her.

25
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:31,658
Scooter?

26
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,033
It looks like you've dislocated your arm

27
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:44,887
My friend also dislocated his arm and he sure had a hard time because of that.

28
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:47,592
- Go Dong.-Yes.

29
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:51,417
Let's go to the hospital.

30
00:01:51,417 --> 00:02:05,367
Should we do that, Hyung-nim?

31
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:11,442
Ah, what is this? I wanted to take a picture of his good-looking face...

32
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:16,725
Ah! Mr.Oh, it's been a long time!

33
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:17,917
What? In front of our house?

34
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:21,708
Hyung-nim!Are you all right?

35
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,217
Of course, he's alright!

36
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,683
He's quite the crybaby, isn't he?

37
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,143
Please try to move your arm.

38
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,758
I told you that it hurts...

39
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,967
That's why you should try moving it.

40
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,008
Even the kid didn't complain of pain.

41
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,817
She's right! It doesn't hurt at all!

42
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:46,325
Hyungnim, try moving it slowly. Slowly.

43
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:49,508
You see? It doesn't hurt at all, does it now?

44
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:50,112
Yes.

45
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:54,001
Ah, I need to go pee!

46
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,133
You can't even tolerate that kind of pain.

47
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,542
You were so bold when you stole my scooter from me.

48
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,617
Don't I need to get my arm x-rayed?

49
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:03,633
There's no need! It's not my first time relocating people's arms!

50
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:17,367
All you need to do is put a hot towel over it. There's no need for an x-ray. You sure have a lot of money, don't you?

51
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,346
Look here!

52
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:22,217
Because of you my Billy suffered an excruciating pain losing his arm.

53
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:25,583
If I just think about what happened then, I just want to dislocate your other arm!

54
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,005
Woah! Please calm down! You can't be like this.

55
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:31,083
This isn't the case!

56
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,683
I was right! You're a member of 'Give &'.

57
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:37,575
You know our schedule better than I do!

58
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:40,708
Why did you lie about not being our fan when you've got all of this?

59
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,004
I asked for your help because I saw that emblem.

60
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:45,517
That's not me.My friend..

61
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:54,017
Enough.

62
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:56,875
This is a thank you present.

63
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,933
What is that?

64
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:01,001
You have to figure that out yourself.

65
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,042
As a fan interest.

66
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:09,094
Anyways, thank you for this.Then, good bye.

67
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:11,383
You were a member of 'Give &'!

68
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:15,231
You should've told me earlier!

69
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,183
Then, I'll be seeing you next time.

70
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,768
Hyung-nim!Let's go together.

71
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:22,025
What is wrong with them?

72
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:33,042
They're such rude dogs!

73
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,655
Are you not feeling well?

74
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,942
I don't know.

75
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:41,003
Anyways, it's the first time I see a woman master.

76
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:44,073
No wonder, the way she handled my arm that time!

77
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,533
That was art itself!

78
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,007
Don't talk about that weird woman!

79
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:51,909
I don't think she even cleaned, because there was so much dust...

80
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,463
But, Hyungnim...

81
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,621
I'm asking because I'm really curious...

82
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,408
What is it?

83
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,595
Why did you write down your schedule there?

84
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:02,833
You even kept it as secret from your fans.

85
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,971
Hyung-nim.

86
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,876
Because she only had Won Kang Hwi's schedule up there!

87
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,469
He only has one drink commercial!

88
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,989
But I have more than three, notebook (laptop), outdoor wear and clothing!

89
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:13,095
What?!

90
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,583
This is all because of Won Kang Hwi!

91
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:21,575
That jerk, he's probably laying around at home pretending to be recovering...

92
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,341
Ah, seriously, Won Kang Hwi!

93
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,725
You really are a nuisance! A nuisance!

94
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,551
Hyung, please be quiet!

95
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:37,477
Aigoo!

96
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:40,168
It really looks good on you.

97
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:42,008
It's nice.

98
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,076
It's this season's new item. That's the last one left.

99
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:48,116
It's limited edition, so not a lot came in.

100
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,121
Limited edition?

101
00:05:50,121 --> 00:06:06,035
How did you know that I liked limited edition items?

102
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:09,008
How can our oppa be so bling-bling!

103
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,961
He just shines like no other!

104
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:16,158
Who the hell is that? Why is she back?

105
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,425
Isn't that her...

106
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:20,007
That girl that came all the way to Korea to see our oppa?

107
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:23,971
They say she's been in Korea for a while to stalk 'Take One'.

108
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:27,533
She must have a lot of money! She goes to all of their overseas concerts.

109
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:31,281
Some people are born with rich parents and go around like that...

110
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,217
Oh, right!

111
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,425
What are you going to do about the fan meeting coming up?

112
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:37,056
You, Kang Hwi's wife, are going to go, right?

113
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,625
I do want to go.

114
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,575
Even if I had to give up my body and soul, I want to go...

115
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:44,458
But, enough is enough.

116
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,867
I'm tired of extending my credit card debt.

117
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:57,085
Oppa!

118
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,292
Oh.

119
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:03,575
Hey! What's wrong?Hey! Are you sick?

120
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:08,175
Did you see that!? Oppa looked at me and smiled!

121
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:13,992
I will go! I have to go to the fan meeting, even if I have to sell my soul!

122
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,279
Ok!

123
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,001
Ok! Ok! Ok!Ok! Ok! Ok!

124
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,038
If you have any money on you, please give it to me!

125
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,758
It's really urgent!

126
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,258
What's so urgent?

127
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,008
Is 'Take One' releasing a new song?

128
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:31,975
A showcase? If not that, a concert?

129
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:35,425
Fan Meeting.

130
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:38,508
Ok!This time I really have to go.

131
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,002
My oppa is waiting for me.

132
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,095
Get lost. You're getting in the way.

133
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,243
Hey!

134
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:45,876
Just think that you're giving me an advance on my paycheck.

135
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:49,204
There isn't a mean boss in this world that does not pay in advance!

136
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:52,683
And, you've made a lot of money opening a store like this!

137
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:54,342
Do you think I'm done once I finish selling all of this?

138
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,633
A person needs to invest again in order to make money!

139
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,342
Besides, I already used that money to preorder our fall collection.

140
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,408
You see that over there, right? Our Billy...

141
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:04,225
It was expensive hiring him as well.

142
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:06,342
Then, you have the registration money that came in from your Taekwondo students!

143
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:07,801
Give me that at least!

144
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,275
Do you know how many Taekwondo students I have?

145
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:14,017
All of them moved to the new gym that's at the intersection, so not many are left!

146
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,075
Jang Man Ok.

147
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:17,325
Are you really going to be like this?

148
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,333
You're making me feel ashamed of myself.

149
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,033
I might only be unemployed but

150
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:26,225
is this how far our friendship goes?

151
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:29,933
Is it?

152
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:39,457
How much do you need?

153
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:45,458
Ok, but you'll have to work harder for the online shopping mall. And manage the homepage well.

154
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,392
I'll work really really hard!

155
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:52,325
Our boss is the best!

156
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,392
Are you messing around with me right now?

157
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:54,971
What do you think our Kang Hwi oppa is?

158
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:58,183
What? It's two bills. Didn't you ask for $20?

159
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,742
It's a VIP invites only seat! Do you really think it'll only cost $20?!

160
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,758
It's $200!

161
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:04,092
Are you crazy?

162
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,823
They're always on TV!

163
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,575
You are seriously going to pay $200 to go see them!?

164
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:11,717
If I don't see my Kang Hwi oppa regularly, I can't go to sleep at night.

165
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,389
You don't know because you haven't seen him,

166
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:16,257
but my Kang Hwi oppa's face just shines!

167
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:29,683
I know.I know.

168
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,158
What are you?

169
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:34,883
Have you ever seen our Kang Hwi oppa in person?

170
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,008
When? Where? How?

171
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,558
Hurry up and tell me! Before I do something to you!

172
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,342
Ah, it's not that...

173
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:46,642
His hand...

174
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,258
Everyone! Everyone! Big news!

175
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,458
Today my best friend met Kang Hwi.

176
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,146
She saved Kang Hwi from danger,

177
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:56,717
but my friend grabbed Kang Hwi's hand...

178
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:59,225
<i>Who grabbed whose hand?!

179
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,167
<i>Who's the wench!? How dare she grab our Kang Hwi's hand?

180
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,233
<i>To the person who posted this news, hurry up and tell us who your friend is!

181
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:22,917
Is it here? Are we at the right place?

182
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:31,508
What did you say? Whose hand did you grab?!

183
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:32,729
Oh...

184
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,158
You know, the guy that also comes out singing with Kang Hwi.

185
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,825
Ah..Tae Ik?

186
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:41,267
You're really funny, you know? You call one an oppa and the other Tae Ik?

187
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,467
Who cares.

188
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:46,625
I like Kang Hwi oppa.I'm not a fan of Tae Ik.

189
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:51,125
Our Kang Hwi oppa is so much hotter! The other one thinks he's so great!

190
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,908
I really can't understand people like you.

191
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:57,317
If you like <i>Take One</i>, shouldn't you like both of them?

192
00:10:57,317 --> 00:11:03,208
That's fine. There's no way you'd understand the profound world of us fans.

193
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,183
But, what? What did you do with Tae Ik's hand?

194
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,003
Ah, nothing!

195
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:08,008
Go! Get lost!

196
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,933
What about my money?

197
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:11,001
Did you leave your money with me?

198
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,342
I don't have any! Registration fees didn't come in yet either!

199
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:15,475
I'm barely making rent this month too.

200
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,208
Rent?

201
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,883
I'll give you a discount!

202
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:21,083
If you give me money now, I'll give you a 10% discount!

203
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,433
What do you say? Yes?

204
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,967
Do you know how much of that rent money you've taken?

205
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:29,875
So, leave before I call your mom and tell her how much you've taken from the rent money!

206
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,575
Hurry up and leave!

207
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,005
Alright! Alright!

208
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:36,167
Ah, you're so cheap! I'm leaving!

209
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:40,774
Ah, you seriously!

210
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:45,442
Mom.

211
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:46,633
Mom.

212
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:54,396
1, 2 , 3, 4.... 1, 2, 3, 4-4-4-4

213
00:11:54,396 --> 00:12:01,721
1, 2 ... 1, 2, 3 ...

214
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,589
Why the hell are you turning my music off!

215
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,083
I'm just barely getting the vibe and getting some steps out!

216
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,104
Madam Hong!

217
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:12,439
Mom!

218
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,413
Madam Hong! Mom!

219
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:15,785
Your mom is not dead!

220
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:21,596
Why the hell do you keep calling me? So noisy!

221
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:25,321
My stomach hurts when I try this step.

222
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,171
Hey, hey!

223
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:29,037
I think this step helps lose the tummy! I feel like my tummy is getting slimmer!

224
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,842
Ah, my stomach!

225
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:34,913
Wait a minute. This tummy needs to lose weight.

226
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:39,931
Aigoo! Aigoo!Aigoo!

227
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,893
Hurry up and come out, Madam Hong!

228
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:48,308
I have to tell you something.

229
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:53,049
Who's calling so late at night?

230
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,448
Chauffeur service?

231
00:12:55,448 --> 00:13:02,091
Not answering. Not answering.... Huh?

232
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:07,507
What is this? Is it really Lee Tae Ik?

233
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:22,066
REALLY?

234
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:26,971
Is this too much?

235
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,024
<i>"The enemy of my life"

236
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:31,499
Don't you sleep at night?

237
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:35,499
Ok, if I recruit new Taekwondo students for you, how much are you going to give me?

238
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,028
I want to give you as much as you want,

239
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:41,092
but there isn't anyone that wants to come to our Taekwondo studio.

240
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:44,072
That's why I said I'll help you.

241
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,966
What about, $5 per head?

242
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,578
Go ahead.

243
00:13:47,578 --> 00:14:10,098
Hey, I need to upload the new fall collection pictures. I'm hanging up now!

244
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:20,483
<i>Hallyu Star Lee Tae Ik has also come to Man Ok's Taekwondo Studio

245
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:40,361
When did this all go up?

246
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:43,836
You can't post these here.

247
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:50,518
I'm just a hired part-timer. My boss told me to do this.

248
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:55,294
Your boss, who? Who told you to do this?

249
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,929
This wench... you scared me!

250
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,026
What is this?

251
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,551
Man Ok Taekwondo Studio posters! I did good putting them up, didn't I?

252
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:07,573
My arm hurts from putting these up.

253
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,541
Seriously...

254
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,067
Look what you wrote!

255
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:13,454
Hallyu Star Lee Tae Ik has also come to Man Ok's Taekwondo Studio?

256
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,711
The design, the picture, it all looks so cheap!

257
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,733
Such a smart girl like you, how could you let such opportunity slip by?

258
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,767
Hey, if you relocated Lee Tae Ik's arm,

259
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,403
then you should've at least taken a picture together and spread that out!

260
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:26,627
How could you just let him go like that?You dumb idiot!

261
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,616
So?

262
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:31,393
Then, where did your smart ass get this picture?

263
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,405
The angle, the resolution...

264
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:40,468
It's because it was taken with a mobile phone. Madam Hong's phone is a crappy 2G phone.

265
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:41,383
Anyways...

266
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:45,657
If you get more students thanks to me, you need to lend me the money, ok?

267
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:49,564
Who do you think will come after taking a look at this ugly poster? Forget it!

268
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:52,697
Is there anyone here?

269
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:56,064
Is this the Taekwondo Studio that Take One's Lee Tae Ik came by?

270
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,643
We would like to register.

271
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,686
What?

272
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:02,918
It's $5 per head, ok?

273
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,338
Yes, that's right.

274

Well.Please come this way.

276
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:22,712
You need to fill out an application form.

277
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:25,343
Excuse me,

278
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,624
We came because of this poster. Is this Man Ok's Taekwondo Studio?

279
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,007
Yes, that's right.

280
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:37,235
Welcome to the Korea Taekwondo Federation, Man Ok's Taekwondo studio, that has been around for 50 years! I'm Master Jang Man Ok.

281
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:39,594
May I help you?

282
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:43,637
Oh! You're cute.How old are you?

283
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,655
-Good work.-Good work.

284
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,712
Everyone, wait a minute.

285
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:52,518
Today we're going to take a group picture of our new Taekwondo students.

286
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:54,234
Ok, look at me!

287
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,278
Ok, everyone, turn around from where you are standing.

288
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,368
Master! I didn't get the Taekwondo uniform yet.

289
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:01,524
Oh yeah?

290
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:14,461
Wait a minute then. Your master will give you a very pretty Taekwondo uniform.

291
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:17,309
We used to have so many. There's none left.

292
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,537
I don't even time to go buy some.

293
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,145
Oh! This was here all along.

294
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:30,094
This is all thanks to my outstanding marketing skills. Don't you agree? Here...

295
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:31,428
What?

296
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:35,961
Didn't you say that 30 new students registered? So, $5 per head, 3 times 5 is 15,

297
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,628
so it's $150. Hurry up and pay me $150.

298
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,399
Ok.

299
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,422
Here you are!

300
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:43,985
Hey, just because I told you to give me $150, you are really only going to give me $150?

301
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:49,427
Ok, can't you just give me an advance of $50?

302
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:51,256
I'm doing you a favor. But, in return...

303
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:52,294
In return, what?

304
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:56,068
I want you to take care of Manokee's clothing store for now.I really can't make time for it right now.

305
00:17:56,068 --> 00:18:00,653
Hey! I'm already having a hard time managing the homepage!

306
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,161
I'll handle the orders and stocking the merchandise,

307
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:07,483
all you have to take care of are the purchases, updating the images on the homepage and the shipping.

308
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:11,054
In return, I'll pay you double for the hour! Ok?

309
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:12,668
double?

310
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:16,091
Deal!Don't worry and depend on me!

311
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:18,375
You already saw my great marketing skills, didn't you?

312
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:25,747
I'll double the income for Manokee's Clothing store as well!

313
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,727
Oh, Man Ok, is this what you made?

314
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,308
Huh?What?

315
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,073
Look!

316
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:34,049
Oh, it's Seo Eun!

317
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,701
I had her wear it because we were short in uniforms.

318
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:41,213
Look at all the comments!<Br>They say that the clothing you made is really pretty!

319
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:45,553
A lot of people are asking where they sell it too!

320
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:49,587
Man Ok, let's make this and sell them.

321
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,739
Hey, who will buy this?<Br>It's just a uniform.

322
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:57,547
No, no. With my marketing senses, I'm getting a good vibe for this.

323
00:18:57,547 --> 00:19:06,659
Totally a big hit.

324
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,902
It's so strange.

325
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:16,158
I'm $2 short.

326
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:17,735
Lee Tae Ik.

327
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,031
Hey!Have you seen this?

328
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:21,328
Don't you see there's a bell on the door?

329
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,102
Why do you keep coming here without an invitation?!

330
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:27,394
Then put a bodyguard in front of the door<Br>or lock the door.

331
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:35,658
What is this? Where you adding up your receipts during this emergency?

332
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,905
Two hot bars? (Fish meat on a stick)

333
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:41,003
Why on earth do you save receipts for hot bars?

334
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,018
Leave it.

335
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:44,867
Goodness, are you that poor?

336
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,907
Even if you were,

337
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:53,686
How did you ever decide on shooting this kind of stuff?

338
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:58,168
Ah, the ad shoot I did for the clothing line?

339
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:00,921
The concept is a bit like that...

340
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:03,633
Hey, have you ever done an ad like that?

341
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,729
What are you talking about clothing line?

342
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:12,656
Well, it is an internet clothing store, so I guess you could call it a clothing line ad.

343
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:15,066
But, nonetheless, I don't think this is good.

344
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,926
What is that?

345
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:35,637
Zoom into the background and take a close look at it.

346
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:38,722
Hey, this is you, right?

347
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:41,056
What is this trashy picture...

348
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:45,098
Man Ok's Taekwondo Studio?

349
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,866
Tell them to take down the picture and shut the site down immediately!

350
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:51,796
What does this person have against me to post such horrid picture online?!

351
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,413
There's no need to get so worked up over this.

352
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:56,079
It's small, so as long as they don't zoom into it, no one will know it's you.

353
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,854
But we don't know where and how many posters they've posted already.

354
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:01,931
I've already sent Mr. Hwang, so he'll handle the situation.

355
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,728
Mr. Hwang?

356
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:06,306
How can you trust a person who gives out ginseng candy as a way to advertise?

357
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,647
Isn't there another person?!

358
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,904
That person has been working in this industry for 30 years now.

359
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,922
He has been a manager way longer before you were even born.

360
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,363
His ways may seem old and tacky, and you do see it like that, don't you?

361
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:16,947
But, not all is what it seems.

362
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:20,219
Of course, you wouldn't know that...

363
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:29,944
Just trust me and wait. He is the type of person that will do anything if it's related to you guys.

364
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:37,089
These people are sure not scared of anything.

365
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:41,241
You sure wallpapered the neighborhood walls with your posters, huh?

366
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:50,915
I was going to take them off anyway.

367
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:53,007
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:57,375
By the way, I didn't do it on purpose.It just happened that way.

369
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,964
"It just happened that way.""You didn't do it on purpose."

370
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:02,056
Of course.

371
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:05,361
But even so, you go ahead and make this?

372
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:09,349
Furthermore, you even put the picture up on your internet shopping home page.

373
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:13,028
That is really a misunderstanding.

374
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:15,601
I just uploaded the picture of the uniform,

375
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,148
If you don't look at it carefully, you can't really tell who it is.

376
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:20,999
Do you think what you're saying right now make any sense?

377
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:24,209
Don't you think your neighbors can see?

378
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,252
Do you know how many people have already taken pictures of the poster and posted it on their blogs?

379
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:30,158
I'm sorry.

380
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:36,211
I will hurry up and remove the flyer and erase it from the internet.

381
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:38,765
That's not enough to solve this issue.

382
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,385
You used his pictures illegally,

383
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:43,303
violation use of his name, his portrait rights and on top of everything, infringement!

384
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,622
We will be processing your lawsuit shortly.

385
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,427
Since you have stated your intention,

386
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:51,175
start by shutting the homepage down and get ready to pay the compensation fee.

387
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,145
What?!

388
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:55,595
Excuse me! Can't you just let me go for once?

389
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:58,132
There was no malice involved.

390
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:00,643
Let go of me.

391
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:07,415
Get ready for it Jang Man Ok.

392
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:12,327
Excuse me!

393
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:15,246
Ah, I'm going to go crazy!

394
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:17,342
Hello Grandpa.

395
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:21,799
Jang Man Ok, what's wrong with your voice?'When there's a will,'

396
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,325
'there's a way!'

397
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:29,218
Grandpa, I'm a bit busy right now. Sorry.

398
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:37,245
Look here! Excuse me! Wait a second!

399
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:48,393
What am I going to do now...

400
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,887
Seriously!

401
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:59,038
Why doesn't she pick up the phone, this wench?

402
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,884
Hey, Man Ok! Man Ok!

403
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,775
This is Oscar from Do Wah Dong, no,

404
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:10,333
Our dance teacher, Mr. Oh.

405
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:14,119
She is the Master Jang I told you about.

406
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,738
Hello.

407
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,818
Oh, Jesus Christ!

408
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:20,787
She has the body of a dancer!

409
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,016
Do you want to dance with me?

410
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:26,283
Huh? I don't dance.

411
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:29,849
Hey, this is a great chance for you to learn how to dance!

412
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:33,351
You're athletic so you will learn fast.

413
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,041
Pardon?

414
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:39,227
Our teacher is teaching a dance seminar but

415
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,321
he doesn't have a place to train.

416
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:44,371
So I told him about your studio.

417
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:48,019
After your classes, I thought you can let him use it for few hours at night.

418
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:54,639
I'm sorry.. but if I use the studio for dancing, my grandpa will seriously kill me! Sorry!

419
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:57,266
Hey! Hey! Hey!

420
00:24:57,266 --> 00:25:00,314
Hey, for such a young person, you are so not flexible!

421
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:03,981
It'll be a while until your grandfather comes back home!

422
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:06,973
We will use it cleanly until before your grandfather comes back.

423
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:10,193
I won't use it for free.

424
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:16,321
I will pay you rent, day by day, night by night.

425
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:17,073
Rent?

426
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:18,934
Of course.

427
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:25,033
We won't use the place for free. What kind of person do you think he is?

428
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:28,862
You said that it is $200 per day, right?

429
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,607
Yes, of course. Two hundred thousand won.

430
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:33,993
$200?

431
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:37,779
He's only borrowing at night. You'll earn free money.

432
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:41,625
I would say yes right away.

433
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,223
Let's do it then.

434
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:47,438
Even though the Taekwondo studio is a sacred place, I guess dancing is sacred too.

435
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:49,906
But, it's only until my grandfather comes back.

436
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,612
If he finds out about this, you know what will happen, right?

437
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:54,947
Of course, I know.

438
00:25:54,947 --> 00:26:04,565
Starting tonight then, okay?

439
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,041
Even if I'm not there...

440
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,044
Don't worry because I have the keys.

441
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,008
Pick up the phone quickly. Yes.

442
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:13,852
- Mr. Oh, it's done- Oh, thank you!

443
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:15,737
Let's go.

444
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:17,349
Hello?

445
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:21,321
Yes, I'm Jang Man Ok.

446
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,153
Could I ask who is calling?

447
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:26,282
What?!

448
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:31,108
The law firm?

449
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:34,056
Ajusshi, please drive faster. We will be late if you go like this.

450
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:39,084
What are you doing, Ajusshi?

451
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:41,205
It seems like it's his first time out.

452
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:44,555
I feel so uneasy because we might lose oppa.

453
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:45,818
That's why...

454
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:49,221
We should've just gotten into Mr. Kim's car earlier!

455
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:53,134
Should we call ahjussi to ask him to let us know when they arrive?

456
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:56,049
Go quickly. Quickly.

457
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:07,095
I am going crazy. I am totally going to die.

458
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:09,007
Where are you right now?

459
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,493
Why aren't you answering my calls?

460
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:14,217
I didn't know because it was on vibrate.What is it?

461
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,527
You know where 'Take One' lives, right?

462
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,433
Why do you want to know where my oppa lives?

463
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,642
I need to meet Lee Tae Ik immediately.

464
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,228
Hurry up and tell me where they live!

465
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:25,077
Hey, we don't know where they live exactly.

466
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,683
Even though we went on a 007 mission, we weren't able to find out!

467
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:31,249
Hey! who in the world is asking for our oppa's house??

468
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,027
Is she in her right mind?

469
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,432
<i> Is she crazy??!!

470
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,223
What are you talking about?

471
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,872
You guys pry into their lives and you're saying that you don't know where he lives?

472
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:41,348
We also really want to know.

473
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:43,339
But, why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

474
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:47,019
I'll tell you the details later. If I want to meet Lee Tae Ik, where do I need to go?

475
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:48,861
Well, that...

476
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:51,865
Ahjussi, how can you stop just because the light is red?

477
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:54,557
You have to follow them.

478
00:27:54,557 --> 00:27:57,352
What?Are you following Tae Ik right now?

479
00:27:57,352 --> 00:27:59,232
Why would I follow Tae Ik?

480
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:01,826
We are on the move trying to catch up to Kang Hwi oppa.

481
00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:04,375
I don't know about Take One today.They might be at UEnter today.

482
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,017
Anyway, this is an emergency. Hang up.

483
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,643
Hey, Hey, Hey!

484
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:14,208
This girl, really! Because of who is it that I'm in this trouble!?

485
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,247
Seriously!

486
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,994
Compensation?

487
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:24,293
<i> Then you won't sue, right?

488
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:28,775
<i>To tell you the truth, if this turns into a lawsuit and the media finds out, it won't do my client any good.

489
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:31,347
<i>This won't be good for our image.

490
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:35,034
<I>We prefer to settle this instead of going through lawsuit.

491
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:38,728
<i>So, what should I do?

492
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:41,075
<i>Take down your homepage immediately and pay a compensation of $30,000.

493
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:44,907
<i>This is non-negotiable.

494
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:49,776
$30,000 is a lot of money.

495
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:52,233
What should I do?!

496
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,819
<i>"Jang Man Ok, what's wrong with your posture!"

497
00:28:54,819 --> 00:29:00,084
<i>"When there's a will!"

498
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:02,804
"There's a way!"

499
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:07,232
Yes, If I give them what they ask then, it's stupid.

500
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:26,549
I have to go there and talk to them myself.

501
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:28,817
What is this?

502
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:32,497
What is this? Why did she go in? Isn't she crazy?

503
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:35,673
She is crazy. Come out. Come out quickly.

504
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,022
I really have to meet Lee Tae Ik for personal reasons!

505
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:44,576
Let go of me.

506
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,854
Ajusshi.

507
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:48,817
What is this?

508
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:51,265
Move!

509
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,904
Look at this unni! She must've lost her mind completely!

510
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:56,076
We have rules here too.

511
00:29:56,076 --> 00:30:01,053
No matter how much you like the oppas, you can't just barge in.

512
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:04,784
Move. Now this Unni has something urgent so

513
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:08,105
I have to see this Tae Ik or whatever you call him.

514
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:11,447
What is she saying...calling our oppa, Tae Ik or whatever?

515
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:13,316
This ahjumma is really crazy.

516
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:15,973
Huh? Ajumma?

517
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:17,066
Hey, guys. Tae Ik oppa is here.

518
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:24,834
Where? Where?

519
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:29,282
What? Where are you guys going?You're going to see Tae Ik,right?

520
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:54,216
Guys, let's go together. Guys!

521
00:30:54,216 --> 00:31:00,606
Hey, guys, excuse me. I have an urgent matter to take care of. Guys, excuse me.

522
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:07,083
I'm sorry for that. Sorry!

523
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,028
Look here!

524
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:11,526
You should apologize if you stepped on someone's foot!

525
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:39,283
Tae Ik.

526
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:47,063
What is this?

527
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:57,169
What is this?

528
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:58,365
This is off-limits.

529
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:00,952
I can't enter?What happened?

530
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,507
This is my gym...Who are all these people doing here?

531
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,096
By any chance, are you the owner of this gym?

532
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:09,113
I am the master here.

533
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:10,097
Illegal gambling was going on here.

534
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:13,735
The detectives are investigating and making arrests.

535
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,449
You didn't know?

536
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:16,865
Gambling?

537
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,449
At our gym?

538
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:20,545
Anyway, who...?

539
00:32:20,545 --> 00:32:22,786
Oh! He was...!

540
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:24,155
You two know each other?

541
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,454
Yes...Just...

542
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:28,618
You need to come along for a moment.

543
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:34,008
What?!

544
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:42,098

1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,190
Convert 51.8 decimeters
to kilometers.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,740
So let's just think about what
decimeters means in terms of

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,440
meters, and then we can think
about what kilometers mean in

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,770
terms of meters, and
then convert them.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:21,210
So we're going to start
with 51.8 decimeters.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,600
Now, as a starting point, just
to keep things simple, we're

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,360
going to convert them into
meters, because this prefix

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,710
tells us a lot about how
many meters this is.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,390
So if we want to convert it
into meters, our units are

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,640
going to have to be meters
per decimeter.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,260
And we need this because this
decimeter and that decimeter

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,820
are going to cancel out, and
we're going to be just left

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,700
with meters.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,830
Now 1 meter is how
many decimeters?

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,130
Well, the prefix deci
means 1/10.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,880
So 1 decimeter is
1/10 of a meter.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,410
Or another way of thinking
about it is there are 10

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,630
decimeters for every meter.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,110
This is a smaller unit.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,100
10 of these make up 1 of these,
or 1/10 of a meter per

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,540
decimeter, which is exactly
what that is telling you.

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,550
1/10 of a meter.

23
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,850
Now if you multiply these two
things, what do we get?

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,140
Well, the decimeters cancel out,
and we divide 51.8 by 10.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,800
Multiplying by 1/10 is the same
thing as dividing by 10.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,300
So this is going to be equal
to 51.8 divided by 10.

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,840
The decimal's just going
to move to the left.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
It's going to be 5.18.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,970
So this is going to
be 5.18 meters.

30
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,360
And you should always
do a reality check.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,490
Did it make sense?

32
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,740
Does it make sense that
51 decimeters

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,940
are equal to 5 meters?

34
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,650
Well, sure.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,490
It should go down.

36
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,520
We're going from a smaller unit
to a larger unit, so we

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,420
should have fewer of that larger
unit to make the same

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,370
distance in this case.

39
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,260
A meter is a unit of length.

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:07,290
Now, we're at 5.18 meters, and
we want to now convert it to

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,540
kilometers.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,030
So we're going to want meters
in the denominator and

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,100
kilometers in the numerator.

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,960
Why?

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,450
Because this meter and that
meter will cancel out.

46
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,570
Now, how many meters make
up a kilometer?

47
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,900
The kilo tells us 1,000.

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,010
That is 1,000 meters.

49
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,770
So 1,000 meters are equal
to 1 kilometer.

50
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,170
So if we were to multiply this,
the meters cancel out

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,910
and we'll just be left
with kilometers.

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,590
And multiplying something by
1/1,000 is the exact same

53
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,840
thing as dividing by 1,000,
and that makes sense.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,190
We should get a smaller number
here because we're going from

55
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,020
a smaller unit to
a larger unit.

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,670
So we're going to need
a much smaller amount

57
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,190
of the larger unit.

58
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:05,940
So this is going to be equal
to 5.18/1,000 kilometers.

59
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:15,890
Now, the easy way to do this,
if we take 5.18/10 is equal

60
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,880
to-- we just move the decimal
one to the left.

61
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,080
It's going to be
equal to 0.518.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,950
If we take 5.18 and divide it
by 100, we're going to take

63
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,130
the decimal two to the left.

64
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,100
So one, two, we're going to
have to add a zero here.

65
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,090
So it's going to be 0.0518.

66
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:44,356
And if we take 5.18 and we
divide by 1,000, we're going

67
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:47,230
to move the decimal
three to the left.

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,200
So we'll just do it.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,610
So if we start with 5.18-- the
decimal started here-- we're

70
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,470
going to go one, two,
so that's one

71
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,470
zero, and then three.

72
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,380
And that's where the decimal
is going to sit there.

73
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,170
So this is Or another way, this
is a little over 5/1,000.

74
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,030
This right here is 5/1,000.

75
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,620
It's a little bit
more than that.

76
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:22,930
So our final answer: 51.8
decimeters is equal to 0.00518

77
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,220
kilometers.

78
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,800
And always do a reality check.

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,310
Does that make sense?

80
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,070
Well, sure.

81
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,800
We're going from a really small
unit here, a bunch of a

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,950
small unit, to a very small
amount of a large unit.

83
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,940
It makes sense.

84
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,960
It makes sense that this number
goes down while the

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,790
actual unit becomes larger.
